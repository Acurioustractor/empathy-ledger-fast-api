            "# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n"

          "sampleValue": "Linda Turner\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nA bit of atmos sound from the people behind. Okay. So you can just talk to me. Yep. This is invisible. Um, so we need to do is like say your full name mm-hmm. And then spell it so I don't get it wrong. Okay. What's your full name and spell it? My name is Linda Turner. L-I-N-D-A-T-U-R-N-A. And what do people call you though, LT?\n\nMy initial thumb. And the reason for that is because it's a cultural reason. Um, and it's. An elder passed away with the same name. So in our culture, we're not allowed to use deceased people's names. Sometime it can be for a few years, but sometimes in other groups it's forever. Yeah. How do you like to introduce yourself, like in terms of your background or identity?\n\nWhat's, what's way you do that? Um, well, I introduce myself as you know, Linda Turner, but known as lt. I'm a proud woman by woman. Um, born, um, [00:01:00] no, 160 kilometers north of Tennant Creek in the bush in the sixties. Yeah, so that's how I describe myself. I'm a Bush girl, grew up, um, for the first 13 years of my life.\n\nIn the bush. Yeah. That's awesome. What was that life sort of like, thinking about what life's like now? What's the differences? Uh, I had a, um, deadly um, um, childhood, um, growing up on a, in the bush on a cattle station, um, and. There was no alcohol or violence. So, um, that story about a village, it takes a village to grow children up.\n\nUm, it was certainly true in my case 'cause everyone in the, in the camp, you know, looked out for all the kids. Wow. And what's, um, what's the experience now for you here? Like, what's changed and what's happening? Oh, so much has changed. So much has changed. Not, not only in [00:02:00] our, in our cultural practices, but also, um.\n\nJust in life in general and, and laws and legislation and whatever from the mainstream side as well as, um, the most concerning thing, the loss of our. Um, language and culture. Mm mm There was, um, I think it was in the car before they were talking a little bit about the intervention. Yep. Was was that like a, a memorable big time for you, um, when that happened, or?\n\nYeah. It was a, it was a shocking time for all of us, um, for a lot of, because Aboriginal men were then made to be, um. Pedophiles and, um, um, child abuses and, and all, and every, all the men got, um, blamed for that. And, and even the good, there's good and bad in everybody. Mm-hmm. Um, every culture, every, um, race.\n\nSo [00:03:00] they felt as though. Some good men, good fathers, good grandfathers, good uncles actually got up and were very emotional and they said, I'm not like that. You know? So, and it's upsetting even. Um, as soon as they look at you, they think negatively. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that, and that's what I'd like to change too.\n\nIs there a long term effect of that? Um, is it still now happening? Of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a lot of. Even myself, you know, I feel as though I've, I'm pretty, you know, out there and I've traveled even the world, you know, girl from the bush, but I still get to be made to feel as though.\n\nBecause we all get, um, thrown over the one blanket. Underneath the one blanket. So an example was last week I was in Darwin and I asked this old non-indigenous, um, man for the, I went to ask him for the time and I said, [00:04:00] excuse me, can you tell me the time? No, no, no. Okay. I said, I'm just asking you. Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nI said, look, not, not all aboriginal people are Vegas. You know, so yeah. So we still put up with an example. Alright. Um, how do you, how do you put on a positive mindset and start to work towards like. Um, bigger things in community when there's so much of that stuff that's happened. How do you create a positive moving forward, uh, by example, I guess, you know, like in my family, you know, well, let's lead by example.\n\nYou know, I try, we try to, my sister and I in our family. Try to lead by example to our kids and grandkids. Yeah. But, um, we all feel the same. Uh, you know, some of us experience it on a daily basis, so. Maybe that's a, that's a reason why a lot of people dream. You know, some of us have made a choice, [00:05:00] you know, not to let it affect, we can say not to let it affect, but it does affect us.\n\nWhat, what are some of the things you are looking forward to doing? Like, are you, have you got some projects and plans for things? Yes. Yeah. Um, we, um, my business partner and I, we were trying to start up a little business, you know, um, sharing our culture. And our bush medicines and our bush tucker and, and, um, we wanna do it show tourists so that it's, um.\n\nIn the end, it'll bring understanding and, um, to know that they, you know, this is how we lived. And, um, my business partner's got a, Trisha's got a block of land here on Waramug country. So, um, we plan to run it from there and, and to get houses built out there with the help of, um, many friends, donations for.\n\nPhilanthropy. Um, that's a really hard word for me. [00:06:00] Philanthropy. Yeah. Philanthropy. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so we've had tremendous help. We've actually, um, gone to New South Wales, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, um, ball other places, talking about our dreams to, um, be able to design and, um. Live in houses that are culturally appropriate, climate friendly.\n\nUm, so that's a really big thing at the moment for us. You know, I'm very, um, inspirational to know that a lot of work goes into it. Mm-hmm. But, you know, um, how, how can people best support you, do you think? And, and in what way? Like. Um, I'm sure there's different ways people can support, but how, how are you trying to get it, I guess?\n\nYeah. But how would you like people to come and work with you? Um, well, you know, we've had tremendous amount of people working with us, um, for one of the houses for Norman's house. Um. Engineers, [00:07:00] architects. Um, so we've built really good relationships. Um, and when we first started talking about these things, um, it was quite groundbreaking for us because we actually, you know, one of them, um, said.\n\nWhat does designing your own house mean? You know, that's how, um, how different it is. Um, and I thought, well, we've never been asked, we've never been asked at what sort of house we'd like to live in. So this is a really exciting, exciting time. You know? Um, there's so much potential out there. Absolutely. Um.\n\nWhat would, it could, can you paint a picture of what you think it would look like when you feel successful? When you feel like it's new? Like what, what would it look like? Um, oh, we, Trisha and I talk about it often, um, that we have our own, um, houses out there, our two houses, one for her family, one for my family, as well as [00:08:00] Norman, who's already on the way.\n\nUm. We'd like to have a, um, a facility there, a shed or something where we can host tourists or people, um, to talk about our culture, show our bush medicines, um, and hopefully have people camp there, tourist camp there to um, you know, get a cultural experience. That's what we want to promote, um, through our businesses is.\n\nOur culture. Yeah. Um, a lot of people that provide resources talk about this idea of impact. Mm-hmm. Um, and I think sometimes it's difficult to align with a western ideal of impact. 'cause it's like a bunch of numbers, a bunch of made up shit. What, what do you think impact would be for you for out there like.\n\nHow would that look for you as a, as a, um, well, the impact we've, we've spoken about Trisha and I, is to, we're setting this up for our kids and grandkids and that [00:09:00] they'll even, you know, independence, um, having a, being in charge of your own destiny, I guess. Um, being able to live on your own place. Um, we, we were talking this morning about, um, training them to identify the bush medicines and the bush.\n\nWe were talking about that this morning. So, um, some of our kids are following us and it, and gradually we're not forcing them, but we always encourage 'em. This is, you know what, we wanna leave for you guys. Yeah. Mm. Awesome. Yeah. Um, how much of your energy is this going to take? Like what, what do you need to do and what, what can people do to help you with that energy, I guess?\n\nAh, you're only two people. How? Yeah. Um, come and stay with us and help us physically, maybe, you know, to build some structures. I don't know. I don't really know. I'm, I'm blown away by the help and support and the generosity of people [00:10:00] already, you know, um, the ones that have given all that money to build a first house.\n\nAnd, and just meeting people who really are inspired by this concept of culturally appropriate. You know, climate friendly housing\n\nis a doggy liking that.\n\nThe Piper likes it. Um, one last little question. Um, that's a good question. I, yeah. All I see is opportunities in all of these communities. Um, like I'd love to see like what, what happens here? Spread. Yeah. How, how do you feel about. The opportunity to do, like to [00:11:00] make a successful goal over here, but then almost share that around Australia.\n\nOh, yep, yep. That's what we, we always have talked about. And the concept right at the beginning was, 'cause they've already done a couple of, we done has already done a couple of road trips to other communities who have really shown a lot of interest. So my vision in my two days. A week that I work with, um, and be involved in all of this is I'd like to eventually see the government sit down and talk to us, um, and realize that this could be a way of saving money.\n\nYou know, because billions of dollars of, um, funds just go and don't actually. Fit the need, you know? Um, there's so many houses. I think it was something like 450 houses needed to build to bring it up to parity, you know? Yeah. So [00:12:00] to just get on, on every, so that's how many houses behind, you know, people are, yeah.\n\nAnd I think it's a 10 year, um, waiting list on the waiting list for public housing here in Ken Creek. Yeah. That's such a long time. Yeah. So, you know, that's, yeah, it's a human, right? Yeah. For everybody to have, you know, houses, but, you know, Aboriginal people, I guess make do with what we can, you know, live in tin houses, find ways around that.\n\n'cause we, you know, you can cook on the fire, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. Mm. Um, this might be a tough question, but I'll see how I go. Um, I think some people on the east coast of Australia and around from privilege, some of them have an misunderstanding of a lot of money gets given to indigenous people.\n\nMm-hmm. Where do you think that comes from and do you know what the reality of that is? Like? Well, media has a lot to do with it. Um, you know, we hear [00:13:00] $4 billion over, you know, whatever, 10 years, but it's, people just focus on $4 billion, you know, going in for housing. Not realizing how long, but then they don't.\n\nThey see it going from government straight to aboriginal. People who misuse and waste that money. They don't think it it. That's where the money goes off in the middle, in the bureaucracy, in the public servant. You know, that's where most of the money gets and hardly anything reaches the ground. But trying to explain that.\n\nYou know, media have a lot to do with the narrative of everything that's happening around Australia, you know? Um, and sad to say, but indigenous stories, good stories, good news stories aren't picked up very well. Mm-hmm. It's all bad stuff that gets picked up. So true. Yeah. It's happening in Queensland at the moment on justice.\n\nYeah. It happens in, um, yeah. [00:14:00] Yeah. That's the, that's, I think that's the thing that Nick and I most fascinated. That $4 billion. I'd love to do some type of analysis. Yeah. And just see like what percentage is going to who, because the amount of like white consultants that are in that middle bit. Mm-hmm. In, so Yeah.\n\nAnd that's where that money goes to. They're the ones that, you know, um, benefit from it all, but then got the check to talk about Aboriginal people, not. I'm spending money wisely. You know, uh, it's really when we are talking about that racism, you know, I try not to do this, but on Facebook, you know, when Spirit Walker or um, sovereign Nation, you know, they put something up about, you know, old pictures or good stories about Aboriginal people, you go into the comments and you just see straight away, you know?\n\nUm, and I always tell myself, why am I doing this? You know, I'm upsetting myself by reading it because this is. [00:15:00] Still happening, you know? But then sometimes I just wanna, you know, when I want to get angry, I just read the comments. So it's still, you know, it's still happening. Yeah. Super tough that stuff, like you kind of want to leave it alone, but when it's, yeah.\n\nWhen it's something that's specifically targeting an identity you belong with. That's, yeah. Super.\n\nUm, cool. Good yarn. Yeah. Do you have anything else that you wanted to make sure you said or No? I don't think so. I've just, um, yeah. Thank you for listening to us and come visiting us here. I'll be back. Yeah, no, we look forward to that. And yeah, I'll, um, what we'll do I.\n\n"

            "from Mackay but you know North Queensland they're talking about down south it's South of Rockhampton yeah and I'm talking about Sydney yeah yeah yeah my old man the day he finished his apprenticeship he got on his 125cc motorbike in 1955 and rode out of Mackay never to return oh really yeah Mackay to Rocky was all dirt still at that stage yeah there was no bitumen North of Rockhampton I was in Mackay last few weeks ago I don't mind it all right got a lot bigger yeah all right that'll do right it's your name and spell it that's cool too yeah when you look at me it's all cool okay yeah I'm Greg Graham g-r-e-g-g-r-a-h-a-m cool and tell us a little bit about yourself I guess what's a couple of couple of key key points that what people know about you yeah I've been retired now for three years and working with Orange Sky for about two and a half for those three years um predominantly here but I cover the odd shift shortage if we've got a sort of a group chat that if people are short and they jump on and we go and help out so I live locally not far from here and um yeah it's been a good thing for me in retirement it's been a good opportunity to get out and about and do something different to what I did for 40 odd years at work what'd you do for work I worked in the heavy earth moving and mining equipment sector so worked for the caterpillar dealer here in Newcastle for the last eight years before I finished up 21. I don't know if I have a breezy caterpillar deal or not I've got a couple of thousand there's probably a few of them in there yeah I might know him Marshall's his name I can't remember his name um Cole what's um what's what's come to Orange Sky like for you how does it feel that feels pretty good yeah we've got a regular group of people that we help with their laundry here and together with the the lunch etc that Catholic Care put on so it's yeah it's kind of a knit little group and then we have a few people who you know probably aren't that regular but the regular people are all super friendly and I'm happy to be part of the whole Orange Sky experience and like it's um laundry and stuff yeah so we wash and dry people's clothing for them that they either don't have access to it or there's something else that prevents them from from doing their own laundry whether it's their health or um the fact they don't have access to the facilities etc it can be any number of things so we don't pry too deeply into why they they use it we're just happy to give them a hand and take it from there what's the feeling of like the connection I guess and conversation and stuff is it pretty casual yeah generally it's pretty casual you know some people a bit more upset one week to the next but um yeah generally pretty casual and I think the fact that we've got so many regulars and that we've got a pretty small team here there's only six or seven people in the group and there's only six or seven of us work this shift and so a lot of us are here most weeks and we've got to know all these people you know really well what's um has it changed you in any way do you think in terms of perception or life or anything after volunteering oh look I think I won't say I lived my whole life under a rock but I think you don't when you're immersed in full-time work and you're not doing any volunteering of any kind it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble and not have a very broad understanding of you know what life's like for other people that aren't that far from where you live and what what's your perception of this area I guess in Newcastle and is there is there different areas in Newcastle that are doing a bit more tough than others um yeah look I think this area generally does it tough it just whether the economy is good or not these people are you know they're up against it and um you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and it's it's um you know it's a life's life's uh a bit challenging for a lot of these people a lot of the time there's no there's no easy days here and um so yeah that's been one of the good things it just helps you be a bit more grounded and I think the other thing is you realize that you know it's pretty easy when you're you know embroiled in your own little bubble to be more judgmental than you should be and yeah a bit more considerate of the nature of what people are up against um I really started just because I I wanted to do something that would help other people with their you know the time I had on my hands once I retired and um I'd seen a bit of media about Orange Sky and I thought it was a good idea and I just put my hand up to to volunteer for it so what's the conversation with friends and family changed in terms of what you do here and do they ask about this and homelessness yeah they do I think um yeah they most people here in Newcastle don't really understand what goes on Hamilton South or public housing areas and um so it's been good to be able to say look you know they're just people making their way as best they can and um you know it's not not whatever your preconceived notion of what goes on um you know it's typically um not not accurate what's um it's like a different question I I never am good at answering this but what's the type of things you think look like the person can do that's kind of helpful for people that are experiencing homelessness like outside of giving money or whatever are there actions that they can take is there a perception that they can change like what's your take on what people can do well I think if they you know if their rest of their life sort of allows it get involved in some face-to-face stuff because you know you can read about lots of things but you really need to get that personal experience and interaction with people to get a deeper and better understanding of of what's going on that's a good answer it's a little better answers I've got for that uh cool is there anything else like you wanted to say in relation to orange sky like um my very good mate Nicholas Marchese is listening so feedback critical yeah no we're I think we're very well supported by the broader Orange Sky organization and the people you know when we've had technical issues or anything like that um it's never been too much trouble for anyone we've had to get on the other end of the phone so you know it's the it's a robust Front Line Organization and it's got a robust back room that's helping those people that are delivering the services to their to our friends gotta wave out a brand team too yeah last four years yeah no it's a strong brand it's a lot of people you don't have to explain too much you know about what Orange Guy does once you tell them they go oh yeah that's the the laundry bands or you know okay that's that's it that's all it's an out, not an option one by one one by one by one is a good thing. whatever so I think yeah whoever's running the brand piece is doing a good job. Cool, maybe I can say that back to Nicholas and I can go get a bonus for my previous time building the brand. Yeah, cool that's it. Hit him up. Pay the money Nicholas."
