      "Transcript": "Linda Turner\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nA bit of atmos sound from the people behind. Okay. So you can just talk to me. Yep. This is invisible. Um, so we need to do is like say your full name mm-hmm. And then spell it so I don't get it wrong. Okay. What's your full name and spell it? My name is Linda Turner. L-I-N-D-A-T-U-R-N-A. And what do people call you though, LT?\n\nMy initial thumb. And the reason for that is because it's a cultural reason. Um, and it's. An elder passed away with the same name. So in our culture, we're not allowed to use deceased people's names. Sometime it can be for a few years, but sometimes in other groups it's forever. Yeah. How do you like to introduce yourself, like in terms of your background or identity?\n\nWhat's, what's way you do that? Um, well, I introduce myself as you know, Linda Turner, but known as lt. I'm a proud woman by woman. Um, born, um, [00:01:00] no, 160 kilometers north of Tennant Creek in the bush in the sixties. Yeah, so that's how I describe myself. I'm a Bush girl, grew up, um, for the first 13 years of my life.\n\nIn the bush. Yeah. That's awesome. What was that life sort of like, thinking about what life's like now? What's the differences? Uh, I had a, um, deadly um, um, childhood, um, growing up on a, in the bush on a cattle station, um, and. There was no alcohol or violence. So, um, that story about a village, it takes a village to grow children up.\n\nUm, it was certainly true in my case 'cause everyone in the, in the camp, you know, looked out for all the kids. Wow. And what's, um, what's the experience now for you here? Like, what's changed and what's happening? Oh, so much has changed. So much has changed. Not, not only in [00:02:00] our, in our cultural practices, but also, um.\n\nJust in life in general and, and laws and legislation and whatever from the mainstream side as well as, um, the most concerning thing, the loss of our. Um, language and culture. Mm mm There was, um, I think it was in the car before they were talking a little bit about the intervention. Yep. Was was that like a, a memorable big time for you, um, when that happened, or?\n\nYeah. It was a, it was a shocking time for all of us, um, for a lot of, because Aboriginal men were then made to be, um. Pedophiles and, um, um, child abuses and, and all, and every, all the men got, um, blamed for that. And, and even the good, there's good and bad in everybody. Mm-hmm. Um, every culture, every, um, race.\n\nSo [00:03:00] they felt as though. Some good men, good fathers, good grandfathers, good uncles actually got up and were very emotional and they said, I'm not like that. You know? So, and it's upsetting even. Um, as soon as they look at you, they think negatively. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that, and that's what I'd like to change too.\n\nIs there a long term effect of that? Um, is it still now happening? Of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a lot of. Even myself, you know, I feel as though I've, I'm pretty, you know, out there and I've traveled even the world, you know, girl from the bush, but I still get to be made to feel as though.\n\nBecause we all get, um, thrown over the one blanket. Underneath the one blanket. So an example was last week I was in Darwin and I asked this old non-indigenous, um, man for the, I went to ask him for the time and I said, [00:04:00] excuse me, can you tell me the time? No, no, no. Okay. I said, I'm just asking you. Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nI said, look, not, not all aboriginal people are Vegas. You know, so yeah. So we still put up with an example. Alright. Um, how do you, how do you put on a positive mindset and start to work towards like. Um, bigger things in community when there's so much of that stuff that's happened. How do you create a positive moving forward, uh, by example, I guess, you know, like in my family, you know, well, let's lead by example.\n\nYou know, I try, we try to, my sister and I in our family. Try to lead by example to our kids and grandkids. Yeah. But, um, we all feel the same. Uh, you know, some of us experience it on a daily basis, so. Maybe that's a, that's a reason why a lot of people dream. You know, some of us have made a choice, [00:05:00] you know, not to let it affect, we can say not to let it affect, but it does affect us.\n\nWhat, what are some of the things you are looking forward to doing? Like, are you, have you got some projects and plans for things? Yes. Yeah. Um, we, um, my business partner and I, we were trying to start up a little business, you know, um, sharing our culture. And our bush medicines and our bush tucker and, and, um, we wanna do it show tourists so that it's, um.\n\nIn the end, it'll bring understanding and, um, to know that they, you know, this is how we lived. And, um, my business partner's got a, Trisha's got a block of land here on Waramug country. So, um, we plan to run it from there and, and to get houses built out there with the help of, um, many friends, donations for.\n\nPhilanthropy. Um, that's a really hard word for me. [00:06:00] Philanthropy. Yeah. Philanthropy. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so we've had tremendous help. We've actually, um, gone to New South Wales, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, um, ball other places, talking about our dreams to, um, be able to design and, um. Live in houses that are culturally appropriate, climate friendly.\n\nUm, so that's a really big thing at the moment for us. You know, I'm very, um, inspirational to know that a lot of work goes into it. Mm-hmm. But, you know, um, how, how can people best support you, do you think? And, and in what way? Like. Um, I'm sure there's different ways people can support, but how, how are you trying to get it, I guess?\n\nYeah. But how would you like people to come and work with you? Um, well, you know, we've had tremendous amount of people working with us, um, for one of the houses for Norman's house. Um. Engineers, [00:07:00] architects. Um, so we've built really good relationships. Um, and when we first started talking about these things, um, it was quite groundbreaking for us because we actually, you know, one of them, um, said.\n\nWhat does designing your own house mean? You know, that's how, um, how different it is. Um, and I thought, well, we've never been asked, we've never been asked at what sort of house we'd like to live in. So this is a really exciting, exciting time. You know? Um, there's so much potential out there. Absolutely. Um.\n\nWhat would, it could, can you paint a picture of what you think it would look like when you feel successful? When you feel like it's new? Like what, what would it look like? Um, oh, we, Trisha and I talk about it often, um, that we have our own, um, houses out there, our two houses, one for her family, one for my family, as well as [00:08:00] Norman, who's already on the way.\n\nUm. We'd like to have a, um, a facility there, a shed or something where we can host tourists or people, um, to talk about our culture, show our bush medicines, um, and hopefully have people camp there, tourist camp there to um, you know, get a cultural experience. That's what we want to promote, um, through our businesses is.\n\nOur culture. Yeah. Um, a lot of people that provide resources talk about this idea of impact. Mm-hmm. Um, and I think sometimes it's difficult to align with a western ideal of impact. 'cause it's like a bunch of numbers, a bunch of made up shit. What, what do you think impact would be for you for out there like.\n\nHow would that look for you as a, as a, um, well, the impact we've, we've spoken about Trisha and I, is to, we're setting this up for our kids and grandkids and that [00:09:00] they'll even, you know, independence, um, having a, being in charge of your own destiny, I guess. Um, being able to live on your own place. Um, we, we were talking this morning about, um, training them to identify the bush medicines and the bush.\n\nWe were talking about that this morning. So, um, some of our kids are following us and it, and gradually we're not forcing them, but we always encourage 'em. This is, you know what, we wanna leave for you guys. Yeah. Mm. Awesome. Yeah. Um, how much of your energy is this going to take? Like what, what do you need to do and what, what can people do to help you with that energy, I guess?\n\nAh, you're only two people. How? Yeah. Um, come and stay with us and help us physically, maybe, you know, to build some structures. I don't know. I don't really know. I'm, I'm blown away by the help and support and the generosity of people [00:10:00] already, you know, um, the ones that have given all that money to build a first house.\n\nAnd, and just meeting people who really are inspired by this concept of culturally appropriate. You know, climate friendly housing\n\nis a doggy liking that.\n\nThe Piper likes it. Um, one last little question. Um, that's a good question. I, yeah. All I see is opportunities in all of these communities. Um, like I'd love to see like what, what happens here? Spread. Yeah. How, how do you feel about. The opportunity to do, like to [00:11:00] make a successful goal over here, but then almost share that around Australia.\n\nOh, yep, yep. That's what we, we always have talked about. And the concept right at the beginning was, 'cause they've already done a couple of, we done has already done a couple of road trips to other communities who have really shown a lot of interest. So my vision in my two days. A week that I work with, um, and be involved in all of this is I'd like to eventually see the government sit down and talk to us, um, and realize that this could be a way of saving money.\n\nYou know, because billions of dollars of, um, funds just go and don't actually. Fit the need, you know? Um, there's so many houses. I think it was something like 450 houses needed to build to bring it up to parity, you know? Yeah. So [00:12:00] to just get on, on every, so that's how many houses behind, you know, people are, yeah.\n\nAnd I think it's a 10 year, um, waiting list on the waiting list for public housing here in Ken Creek. Yeah. That's such a long time. Yeah. So, you know, that's, yeah, it's a human, right? Yeah. For everybody to have, you know, houses, but, you know, Aboriginal people, I guess make do with what we can, you know, live in tin houses, find ways around that.\n\n'cause we, you know, you can cook on the fire, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. Mm. Um, this might be a tough question, but I'll see how I go. Um, I think some people on the east coast of Australia and around from privilege, some of them have an misunderstanding of a lot of money gets given to indigenous people.\n\nMm-hmm. Where do you think that comes from and do you know what the reality of that is? Like? Well, media has a lot to do with it. Um, you know, we hear [00:13:00] $4 billion over, you know, whatever, 10 years, but it's, people just focus on $4 billion, you know, going in for housing. Not realizing how long, but then they don't.\n\nThey see it going from government straight to aboriginal. People who misuse and waste that money. They don't think it it. That's where the money goes off in the middle, in the bureaucracy, in the public servant. You know, that's where most of the money gets and hardly anything reaches the ground. But trying to explain that.\n\nYou know, media have a lot to do with the narrative of everything that's happening around Australia, you know? Um, and sad to say, but indigenous stories, good stories, good news stories aren't picked up very well. Mm-hmm. It's all bad stuff that gets picked up. So true. Yeah. It's happening in Queensland at the moment on justice.\n\nYeah. It happens in, um, yeah. [00:14:00] Yeah. That's the, that's, I think that's the thing that Nick and I most fascinated. That $4 billion. I'd love to do some type of analysis. Yeah. And just see like what percentage is going to who, because the amount of like white consultants that are in that middle bit. Mm-hmm. In, so Yeah.\n\nAnd that's where that money goes to. They're the ones that, you know, um, benefit from it all, but then got the check to talk about Aboriginal people, not. I'm spending money wisely. You know, uh, it's really when we are talking about that racism, you know, I try not to do this, but on Facebook, you know, when Spirit Walker or um, sovereign Nation, you know, they put something up about, you know, old pictures or good stories about Aboriginal people, you go into the comments and you just see straight away, you know?\n\nUm, and I always tell myself, why am I doing this? You know, I'm upsetting myself by reading it because this is. [00:15:00] Still happening, you know? But then sometimes I just wanna, you know, when I want to get angry, I just read the comments. So it's still, you know, it's still happening. Yeah. Super tough that stuff, like you kind of want to leave it alone, but when it's, yeah.\n\nWhen it's something that's specifically targeting an identity you belong with. That's, yeah. Super.\n\nUm, cool. Good yarn. Yeah. Do you have anything else that you wanted to make sure you said or No? I don't think so. I've just, um, yeah. Thank you for listening to us and come visiting us here. I'll be back. Yeah, no, we look forward to that. And yeah, I'll, um, what we'll do I.\n\n",

So all we need, do your full name and spell your name for me. Okay. So you go your full name and spell it. Just Irene Naja n for L-E-A-L-L-A-J-A-R. And I'm a junior. My mother's a senior.\n\nTell me a little bit about Arnie started with her family. Do you wanna start there about who your family is and where you Oh, sister Alice. Yeah. She's like a cousin. She's my cousin. Yeah. She's my big sister and we've been down here like almost 13, 14, yeah. Years. So we was here with PD for a long time.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tell me what's tell me a bit about where you are from and a little bit about your broader fam, your bigger family. Oh I got my mom and dad. My dad died almost like 30, 35 years now, but [00:01:00] my dad, yeah. And my mom, my dad's, he born in bred Palm Island, so he's Dallas at so many families.\n\nAnd my mum is from, she born Mount Isa. My mom was a NEMA before she got married to Anja, my father, so she she's from at West. She born Mount Isa mom and she traveled some when she was younger there. She was traveled throughout the Northern Territory. Then she met my dad and they got married here.\n\nWow. Yeah. Awesome. Tell me a bit about what, how you feel about Palm Island. What's your feeling about it? Do you like it at Palm Island? Yeah, Palm Island is a beautiful home and it's home of the Boman people, the 40 tribes when they first came here. During the time when travel were sent here to the stolen generation.[00:02:00] \n\nYep. And what's changed over that time since you've been here, and how have you felt during those changes in I see a lot of changes throughout the years 'cause I'm a 1960 baby, so Yeah. I'm 58 years old now and I grew up on Palm. My five brothers and four sisters, they are they people they born Palm Island.\n\nBut I was born in Townsville, so just like back in 60, in the sixties. So we were, some of us was born pre, on the mainland and not really, but Palm Island is a beautiful home. Even today I seen so many different things over the years that changes. So yeah, this is the next generation. Yeah, and I.\n\nI brought up in a like I grew up Palm Island. I come from a family of hunters [00:03:00] and my dad is a, he's a fisherman and a bush walker. He walked along here. My dad is the oldest out of 15 in the old family. So my dad was born Palm Island too. Amazing. Born and bred, like all his siblings, cousins. What, what do you think is special about the activities and things you can do? Arnie was talking about her lease and where she does and fishing and hanging out and stuff. What's the special activities that you like to do on the island that make you most happy? I grew up knowing that I come a family, I come from a family of hunters.\n\nAnd fishermen and when we were small, we used to always, activities was to go camping and learn off the land and how to survive. And grew up with mother, my brothers and sisters. So I. And cousins. So we actually come from a big family, but we come as family, always big family [00:04:00] and everything. So yeah, even if we feel second cousin, but we always know each other as brothers and sisters.\n\nAnd I grew up with so many of my cousins siblings and yeah. But main thing about pama, we grew up in a. At the time growing up, we had everything. We had our elders, more elders and older people that lived during the time of the 70 eighties and nineties and 2000 year 2000 right up to now that some of our old elders and our people passed on.\n\nSo it's up to us now as older ones to steer this generation or young generation. So cool. What's some of the more negative things that maybe happen on Palm Island that you're hoping will change? Be? Pardon? What's some of the more negative things that might happen on Palm Island that you're hoping changes in the future?\n\nNot really. It's about how you grew up in, [00:05:00] in the home environment and how you grew up. Your your parents are your first teachers. I can always say growing up and at this time of this generation is, don't really need to say, like any on the mainstream too through alcohol and drugs and see the different things now, what's happening today.\n\nSo we likable to spread out the words, that spread out. Get more to mental health training workers, get young people to steer the way today because they are the next generation. And what do you hope that Furies can do to help people that are IES\n\ncan help more and to voicing out our opinions of drugs and alcohol and the workers and many more on the mainstream. So I. Yeah, it's the [00:06:00] more, I think mental health workers that we need younger ones to steer away. So it's really the problems. It's not like Palm Island problem, it's throughout the world and throughout the mainstream and other communities, but we've got other community that cares and shares and cares for our young people today.\n\nAnd true, I believe that needing more help.\n\nWhat's your who are the people you hang out with most in Palm Island? Big one. Who are the people you spend most time with in Palm Island? Is it work or at home, or family or children? What, who do you spend with? Like I said, family is everything, so yeah. Family more at home, more during the, environment to be clear towards their young people today and.\n\nMore into, but a lot of young people today love their families and [00:07:00] I don't really like, yeah. To see more of young people getting involved in a lot of things. Like work training, more training for people today, young people to encourage them. That is life after. Education and more education in life totally.\n\nWhat do you hope for the next generation of young people that are coming through Farm Island? Are there things you hope that they do better or more of? Or what's, what do you think to do better? Finish school education. Even though when you finish school, there's more education after that and a lot more to young people today to be educated about alcohol and drugs and yeah.\n\nThat's cool. Is there anything we didn't get to [00:08:00] talk about that you want to make sure you talk about now? Or, no, just, that's all I just wanted to share about. More things to come for our people today and more jobs in our communities and not only that, like us, the older ones, we grew up in Christianity too, and that's important that Christianity.\n\nAnd what's that community like on Palm Oil and the Christian community? Is it. Big or small or, and do people go to church a lot? What's that like? I'll just say not I alone, but in between. But yeah, just more leadership in young people today and getting young people to be trained in areas and to start off small, but everything eventually will get big.\n\nAnd [00:09:00] there's a lot of services in the community and through mental health. Workers training. So some of us at 30 s we did our mental health training here. Now we're doing counselor training now. But yeah,\n\nlife on Palm Island is always, never get bored. There's people go camping and fishing, hunting. Like we did in our time growing up, going back 30, 40 years ago, 50 years ago. So not much. Older people now and our elders, but our love and respect go to our elders, our people, no past, present, future.\n\nAnd get young people to encourage 'em more, to [00:10:00] get up there and they can do whatever they can put their mind to. It\n\nis a beautiful home. This is a island home. Got so many memories of Palm and now that. The older one, young one's passing on. So got Sister Iris down here that, yeah, she helps a lot with us. She's one of the Elder the senior workers here, and she give us a lot of support and lot encouragement and give us wise words.\n\nSo just, and there's many works in the community. That they can encourage, all younger ones too. To be up there and get strong and\n\ncome away from alcohol and drugs today. [00:11:00] It's amazing. You did such a good job. Pardon? I can't wait to show you. Yeah.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "And talk to me, and I need... Navid? I was trying to say that... Your name and what's happening here? Uh... I don't know... Name, what I've told you, name, how long you've been here... Yes, my name is Javier Aparicio Grau and... What I've told you, that... dangerous. Animals are very curious. Well, I've been here since 2008, from 2008 to 2024, just now that... I think I make the date that... I've been years here since I started. From 2008 to 2024, 18... 16 years I've been here. And more or less, what do you want to know? I've been here for about 16 years. What? 16 years. What? Tell me a little about your normal day. Your job in your workshop, in a direct normal way? Well, once I work, in my day-to-day at this job, especially with the little ones, because we are with them all day, From when they start, from when they wake up from sleeping at night, we wake them up, we wake them up gradually, because they are sleeping and you have to wake them up little by little, they get up, clean up, have breakfast, start doing activities, be it gardening, school activities, then they also do sports. Afterward, they shower, as you saw today, then we do interior or exterior cleaning and after that, they also eat, after eating and then we spend some time with them during free time, they might do some recreational activity on the computer, like YouTube, music videos. They are also in a space we call ludic, where they can play. They can play chess, they also play ping-pong, watch television, Netflix series, all these platforms that exist now, until they then go to sleep for a nap. The one in the morning, when they do activities like gardening, sports, and others, in the afternoon they do school, they do schoolwork. And in the afternoons, mostly when they have schoolwork, they spend... They have three, four hours at school and spend almost the whole afternoon there. Then they have some free time, between those hours they have a snack, then after school, they have some free time, to disconnect a bit from the school subject. They have dinner a bit more free time, where they are calmer, watch a bit more TV and such, and then they brush their teeth, all the hygiene stuff, and then they go to bed. They go to their rooms and around eleven or so, the cables they have for the TV are collected. And once the cables are collected, ready for the next day to have the battery charged. It has been more or less... How did you get here? What was your process? Why did you start here? And what makes you keep working here and that you are working at the center? Well, look, I started working here through... In fact, until now, coordinator, Manolo. It was hard for me to come here because it's not easy, when they tell you, you're going to a juvenile center, it's not easy. It gives you a bit... A shock. But well, once I entered, that I came and such, at the beginning, all beginnings in anything, I think, work, it's not easy. Because you have to adapt, you have to adapt the adaptation time. Adapt, especially to the minors, because you come to their house. This is their house, not yours. And you have to come to their house and tell them how things are done. Teach you a little too. And know how the center's regulations work, because this also has regulations and it is what we are based on. A little. And from once you more or less internalize a bit the regulations, you get a bit with the minors and such, everything starts to make sense. At first it's hard, because it's hard for you, because the minors also... Whether you like it or not, you are a bit more nervous. That you say you don't have the nerves, that nerve that you have inside when starting something new, I don't know. So, once you settle down, you get used to the job and to the minors, to the kids and such, everything makes sense. And when they tell you to come here it's because they think that you can work. So, they told me, you, we believe that you can work here. Because of your way of being, your way of acting with the minors and such. And everything went a bit smoother. And in the end, you accept the kids, the minors, the minors accept you and until today. Once you have been 16 years it's because something is going well. And why do you like it? What calls me to this job is because the minors are minors who have committed crimes and such, but they are people, they are little persons. They are not robots. They are not... At the end of the day they are people who are also still kids, who are still not adolescents, who are still not formed and who make mistakes. So, you shouldn't see things as... You shouldn't see things far from reality. The reality that is here is the reality that is outside. And what has called me to this job is that they are still people the same here as those outside. And I think the treatment with people, as far as I'm concerned, I think I do well. I have always been told, if you are a good person outside, if you are a good person in your life, you can work here. I don't consider myself a bad person, then the kids later see that, the minors see it. I always call them kids, maybe it's not well seen. On the contrary. Kids, children, whatever. But if you are a good person, you are a good person, but you also have to leave a bit of space for normality. And you don't have to have a regulation that here, because if you are a good person, but you don't do things as you have to do in this job, and you abide by the regulations a bit too, you can't work here. You have to have a balance of both things there. And what I consider, for what I can be here, for what calls me to this job, and for what you have regularity, is because I consider myself a good person and in the end the kids see that. They see that you have to be fair. What they value is that you are fair. And what called me to this job is that. That the kids need, they are kids who have many needs. And that fills me. That you can help people who need help. That in the end is a bit that. People who maybe, there are some who have had, who have not had a good education. So, that you can contribute a little your grain of sand. That the minors, as they said before in there, are reintegrated. That's what fills me, what calls me to this job. After all. I've answered many of my other questions. One thing that has interested me is, I know it's hard to imagine, but in Australia it's a stilted environment. And it's quite, as if everyone is on edge, and focused on making sure nothing bad happens. And here it's a relational environment, as if people were hugging and talking. I would like to know from your words, like, what do you think creates that? What creates that environment? What's the main thing that creates that? You say, it's hard to explain how it works in Australia for you to understand. But everyone is very focused on nothing going wrong. And on security. Especially, security, security. And we are very based on affective relationships, affective relationships, affective relationships. Well, he wants, well, in your words, well that you explain how it's done or how you get to have those relationships with the kids. How is that achieved? It's achieved, well, that way. When you stop thinking about security, when you stop thinking so much about security and fear, because security in the end, I think it's also a bit about fear. When you break the barrier to approach the kids and you see that deep down they are kids with needs, they are people with needs. When you see that and break the barrier a bit from security, because you come here to work, but you have to be here eight hours. So, if you want to have affectivity with the people, with the kids you're working with, that in the end you're living with. If you don't stop thinking a bit about security and you get closer and have more, more of what we said about getting closer to the minors and in the affective. If you don't leave security a bit aside and get closer to the affective, the kids won't approach you. So, we think it's better to approach with affectivity and with naturalness, that then from security always goes, if you need security, and make a separation about the affective, that in the end will arrive. If the security the affective gives the security. It's that, it's that we, by having more affectivity with the kids, by being more natural, the kids forget that they have to do things out of obligation. And obligation takes away security. I don't know if I have explained myself well. No, no, I explained it perfectly. The thing is, it's like a passive security. We don't need to have anyone with security because if you approach, they trust you and you trust them. That relationship is what makes them not want to do something bad because they don't want to break that trust. They don't want to break that relationship and that is what security is in the end. Just like the Dual. Just like you, for the kids to internalize the regulation, you have to mold it a bit. You can't tell a person, you have to like, just like my son, you have to mold a bit, rack your brain a bit and you have to make mistakes to learn. Because at first you say a bit, you go a bit more regulatory, but then you have to mold the regulation and make it a bit more personal, learn as you go and they see that what you want, is that they are well. When they see that what you want is for them to be well, that you don't want to harm them, everything becomes easier. The last question. What's the broader societal impact of this model? And I guess the second question is, how do you feel when you see youngsters in the community? And if they do something bad. Do you have a different feeling after working here? One is, what impact do you think we make on society when we work? That is, our work how is it then reflected in society? And another, they are two questions. And the other is, after having worked here, how do you think the kids will return to where they live, from where they come? How do you think they will respond after having been around here? According to the work and according to what you have experienced. Regarding the latter. Yes. This is like everything. There is a percentage of people who when they finish here, unfortunately, do not reintegrate because that's the reality. But many others, yes, when they finish here, change the chip. They start to study. In fact, they tell you. Many of them tell you. And then, you find out through mediation from other minors, that when they leave here, they start to work. Because from here there are many who leave at 18 years old. And they also have internalized that from 18 years old, you have to be a bit more careful. You can't commit crimes that easily. And apart from that they mature. They mature. There are minors who are here two years. And in two years they have time to mature and absorb a bit what you also give them a bit. And it seems not, but yes, they internalize many concepts. Even those who re-offend. Yes, yes. Even those who re-offend. And it serves them a lot. There is also a percentage of minors who, unfortunately, do not reintegrate and that's what there is. But there is a high percentage that yes. And the first was... The first was regarding the community. What impact do you think the work we do, the impact it has on society? How can society see us now? I think, I tell you from what... How people close to me see us. The impact on society is a lot of empathy. They empathize a lot with us and give a lot of value to our work. In fact, many people tell me, man, it's difficult. It's difficult and it must be very difficult to work with minors like that in a place... Because you in the end work with a group of minors, who all have committed a crime. And you say, man, how can you work like that? And they see it in a way with a lot of respect. They see it with respect and see... And give a lot of value to our work. And in fact, I explain to many friends. I say, it seems one thing, but then when you work here, it's another. Because they are still little persons that many have, it's what I've told you, many have needs. And there... There are many people who have needs. And there... There are many people who have needs. And there... Many people, I tell you, people outside, what concerns me and is what... My experience is that people close to me, because many others, well maybe I can't tell you how they can come to see it, but the people I know and who tell me, man, it's of great value to work in what you work. It's what... And I think... That if it's the people who are close to me, I think the others also see it as a job with solera and with... And with... With roots of being an important job and an important task trying to reintegrate minors. Perfect. Thank you very much. To you. Well. Perfect.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Amelia Tynan\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Get some very good stories. All t you don't have to look at this. Okay. So first thing you just say your full name and spell it so I don't get wrong. Amelia Tynan. A-M-E-L-I-A-T-Y-N-A-N. Cool. How do you introduce yourself, your identity, your person, how that so I'm known by everyone as Millie, definitely not Amelia.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Although at work it's a little bit different. To my friends, I'm just super chill. I'm one of five girls, so found my way from very young. Had to, or you were left behind. I was middle child, so middle child syndrome. But yeah, I think I moved to Sydney when I was 18 moved down there and was doing executive assistant work.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* For a long time. And then I moved back up to Brisbane because my sister had three kids and she moved back from the uk. So family is very important to me. Moved back home and ended up working at Younguns pretty much as soon as I came back. [00:01:00] So I worked for Trenton Scott for three and a half years as their exec assistant.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Which I think was a really good way to learn a lot about the business. Especially from Scott. He's much more on the I guess touchy feely side. Yeah. And he's the one that kind of was driving the impact at the time, and then they brought Kieran on board. And just by chance I started helping Kieran with a lot of technical stuff.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Sure. And then ended up moving over to Kieran's team last year. And I'm having a ball, obviously, I. I feel very privileged going into the room because I haven't really had any hardships or anything. I'm, I've had a very good life. And being around these kids is very eye-opening and I feel super privileged to be in the room with them and learn all about those stories.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* How would you explain what the program is in your own words? I would explain it as I guess the whole potential first, name has really taken off for a reason. So I think that it is about a bunch of guys that gave it a go [00:02:00] that are willing to give another bunch of guys a go. Especially, I've never met, I've been in some pretty interesting industries.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Most of 'em are all being pretty male dominated. But I've not met a bunch of guys that actually care as much as these guys do, especially Kieran. And I think it's all about just giving them the space to feel safe and, find their own way. And they all have their ups and downs but it's about being there for them and knowing that we're trying not to be like everyone else.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* And, we'll help them where they need to and, they can always come to us if they need it, wow. Why do you think the young fellas keep turning up every day? I think that within the pathways they build that connection and then they end up on site with those people that they've built that connection with.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* I also think, originally when we started, we weren't doing the six weeks, it was two weeks or four weeks, and then we tried eight weeks, but we found that six weeks was that. Sweet spot [00:03:00] where they had actually four weeks out on site with not just their team that they're going through the program with, but also the everyday boys that are out on site that they'll be working with.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* So they're able to build that rapport but also in a really safe way. And I think, if they stuff up or they're late or whatever, they're not being reprimanded for it. It's very understanding. I think George is a big driver in that as well. Out on site. He's very much. Of the belief of giving second chances and he's really communicative, which I think really helps them as well.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* How do you reckon it works with the, from when they first get here to making sure they're turning up every day? What's that process of maybe they're like, haven't experienced something like this before. Is the training different to someone else who would walk in this program?\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* From a privilege perspective or I think it's certainly like a lot of wraparound support. We provide, and definitely once they're in work, this cohort that's just gone through their. Five weeks in, and we're [00:04:00] still calling them almost every time they have a shift to make sure that they're showing up.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* So it's that mentorship. I think that kind of continues. Once they're in work, they're not just thrown into the deep end and see you later. It's very much like we want you to succeed. That's the only reason that we're here. That's the reason why job exists. So that's what we want for you. Without you, without them, there's no us.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* What do you need? To scale, oh, this is probably a tough question. What do you need to scale this up in terms of what support do you need to make this, how big you want it to be? So I think we definitely need buy and from like-minded businesses and individuals. They're talking about this custodian economy which I think is awesome.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* But from my point of view as a bit of a sideliner, I definitely think that there are businesses that are not indigenous that can help and pave the way to, everyone these days has a wrap plan. Everyone knows what's right from wrong. And I just think it's about other people jumping in and not leaving it all up to indigenous businesses or all up to government.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* It's everyone's problem. [00:05:00] You all sit there and say how, prime's up and all of these things. It's will help us do something about it. So I think it's just buy-in and it's also the support from the customers that we're trying to get them on site with. It's the other team, Kieran's doing all this cultural education, trying to keep everyone educated on it.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* We have such a high turnover and so it's this constant sort of reeducation. But yeah, it's just like everyone involved has to be. Very into it. Yeah. What do you see as the best possible outcome in five years? I think the best possible outcome would be hitting all our goals. We have some pretty big goals.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* We've got this custodian economy set up. We're able to hit, I think we've got 450 as our target of bringing kids in the door that stay in employment. I think. It's easy to get them through a program. And it's what a lot of other people do is get them in a program, give them some training, and off you [00:06:00] go.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* But we really wanna see them stay engaged and affect their families and affect, their kids. And it's this positive flow on effect that we want to create. We've always said, if you don't end up at Young Guns, that's great. Best case scenario is you have that pathway, and that's what the pathway really is.\n\n\\*\\*DJI\\\\_20250502171349\\\\_0084\\\\_D:\\*\\* Yeah, amazing. Smashed it. She tried.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Dianne Stokes - all\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nDianne: My full name is Dianne Stokes. And I'm a local, I'm a traditional owner and where I live is where it's in the boundary of my totem and I. Been here for really 24 years, but almost 24. It's 23 years. Dianne Okay. Without shelter, just living here, having the only thing was my shelter when I first moved in was my car, my little car.\n\nI felt good, but I felt scared because of rain. Wind. Heat was to go under them. Big trees down there? \n\nNothing here. When I first came here, just the grass and trees and lizards and everything else. Insects. And what does this country mean to you? It means to [00:01:00] me, it, it means to me something that really makes me happy and it's every time I go away from here, it's like it's calling me. Come back home. And I do feel that I want to, when I get home, I feel happy I'm at home. \n\nWent through this town and my father's, it carries on from father's to father. That's why I resided here because I wanted to stay here. Where it's close enough for me to be in town for shopping and that, and for work and and for the kids to go to school.\n\nBut I was living out in a community where my grandfather's country, my mom's country, I was living there. It was good because I went back to reside there. All my fam, all my family's passed away, [00:02:00] so I wanted to go back and liven up the place. With my families and still wanting to come back here. When I come back here, I know I got no one to tell me what to do.\n\nIt's my home and I've got it registered last year. So it's the place is registered. Is it I wanna have a, in the back where the corner of my, boundary. I wanna have a cultural area there, cultural center, and a youth center. That's what I'm planning to do, where I can have day, daytime kids coming to do their homework if they're not going to school.\n\nThe kids who are in trouble with the police and they have them devices on their legs sometimes that I'm not going to school. Where it's free outside for them to do their homework and do activity like making organic garden or doing painting or doing something out here, [00:03:00] making them live enough because it's outside, there's no houses around.\n\nThey've got a little place where they can do their homework during the day. What do you think kids need at the moment? It needs the house. I need a place where, like a office and a building where the kids do the activity and cultural center at the same time where I can have a building kids go in there, do cultural works, like making bush medicines and doing weaving or something like that.\n\nAnd at the same time having game of soccer and something like that. Like both. Both ways of having having their both ways of having cultural thing, cultural side of in, in white society and Indigenous society [00:04:00] where they can work both ways and teach some of the kids who don't speak English, teach them in English and in language.\n\nTalk to them in language and tell them what this is, what are you gonna do? What's this? Even though there's kids who don't understand English, but it'll be better for them to learn alongside because they're growing up in this town where it's called War Town. We need people to understand what we're doing and what we're talking about.\n\nI need to find a funding. I wanna find a funding and then get an architect to come out and do this thing. Have to show me how I want it and how the thing's gonna be. Like I'm having a little park out here, a little oval.\n\nLike it's 'cause something where they can kick around, do something for their PE or something, during the day. Whatever school gives them to do, they can do it here. I [00:05:00] wanna see it's exciting to see it.\n\nIt'll be good. It is good a bit seeing it, it's coming from s from Nick and without Nick, I've musing the milk crates, doing it like that.\n\nYeah. But I wanna see what he does. Yeah. Let's see let's do it. We'll come back. Ready? Nick, so this can fall like this. Oh. And like this.\n\nYou just saw the finished bed. What do you think now after it's all done? Billy Belly means good. You think you'll be able to use these ones and you want some more? Yeah. It'll be good after. After it's finished. It'll be good. And it'll be using, it'll be used by me mostly if I'm gonna be using it.\n\nIf you're not taking it back, you're taking them back. Oh, thank you right now he's in my language, ma, [00:06:00] I'm a manga. \n\nThat works really good. Because why? I am saying that it takes my memories back to when I was young.\n\nDianne: Working both ways. I grew up in a language I never spoke English in, in, in the kindergarten school when me and my older sister started off going to school in that kindergarten school, they used to come and talk in language before we spoke English and tell us what to say. And it was good because getting out of language.\n\nOtherwise language would've been my li lifetime speaking without learning English. Going to school, it was good. And then I, and again, to go going up to boarding school where I met her we were in boarding school together and boarding school, going away from home, [00:07:00] four years going to school, but coming back for holidays, it wasn't, not enough. Not enough time for us to be with families just for a couple of weeks or two weeks or three weeks holiday, or four weeks holiday and then go back again. It was in that time it was a very hard time for us, but going back, still talking language to our families.\n\nGot raised in a place where we learned to speak language and then going away to speak English. It was easy. It was easy. Like we are getting out of our language, speaking English, learning more sports. Sports and doing things and meeting up with different kids from different land, different areas.\n\nComing to one school and learning different languages at school by listening to other kids who spoke language, and it was good. Hey, [00:08:00] it was good. Yeah. Because some of their language that I learned from, I've learned a little bit of, a little bit of other languages like listening to ki the other kids that were speaking language, especially the girls where we used to stay in their dormitories.\n\nIt was something different from where we've been, like, we've been in a, we got to. Just to the school where we've been in dormitory, but when we were at home, we were staying in where the eldest had a single home where they made it themself by tin shacks or by a grass humpy. We used to live in that with ladies and going up to boarding school, it was like it's different to back home, but living in a house.\n\nIn a dormitory where we had ladies, young girls, we had house mother that [00:09:00] was a lady used to be around us, \n\nif you have an idea what place you'd go to first go and talk to if they know you're coming, go to the elders.\n\nSit down and talk to them or a group of people and tell them if you can show them how to make them beds, and they'll probably be keen on joining in and helping out. Yeah. Sometimes you can go to a there's a organization where they have aboriginal people go there, have meeting with them and let 'em know, and they can take you out to show you where a good area to go to, where you can sit with some people. \n\nSomething that we need to talk to first, to the organization, talk to the community, how do they feel about doing this? And if it is, if someone comes to you, someone from the government side sit down with you and talk to you.\n\nDianne: Let 'em know what you wanna do with them. That's what my plan is to work with the [00:10:00] young youths about. Having a youth center here, something for them to do in their life. Something that they need to learn. Talk about what they do when they're young. It's not good. You're gonna have a bad record in the future.\n\nThat's what I say to my families. They need to hear from the ground, who wants it, who's gonna do it, who's out there, who needs help?\n\nThe people in the community knows about their family, the youths, what happens, what they're doing. At the moment, they're not listening. You need to step in there and tell them that they need to listen to do these things. To make their future, happy and be proud of what they've done in the past. \n\nThat's what I'm looking forward on. Someone with the money to help me out to do this stuff. Like my my, my cement slab there. [00:11:00] I'm looking forward on having something on top of it to make it like a shade or something, or have a something built on it.\n\nDianne: That's what I'm looking forward for. \n\nThere might be for the scratch. Now how, what I'm doing now, I want to show people how my placement, I can map, put a picture of where my photos were taken before.\n\nTo have a little museum for people to come and have a look at it, what it's like, and from the past to now. \n\nI've got some people who were here at the beginning taking photos of the space and I could get them and get them to give me all those photos.\n\nTo put it up somewhere where it's a museum, people can see Yep.

He has a family visit this Friday and they are going to go to Murcia. He has a family visit this Friday and they are going to go to Murcia. It is not the first time he has come to the center. It is not the first time he has come to the center. And he has a serious problem with certain substances. And he has a serious problem with certain substances. Toxic. So, well. He has to be careful, because he has addiction problems. And this is something that goes outside, it is not the first time here. He has to be extra careful. And the biggest problem is that he is already 19, 18 years old. And the biggest problem is that he is already 19, 18 years old. And the biggest problem is that he is already 19, 18 years old. Therefore, any failure and the elastic bed of protection is no longer there. And the biggest problem is that he is already 19, 18 years old. And if there is any mistake, it is not here. How does it feel to go to school? Do you want me to try to talk? It is not a bit of Spanish for the very old. I have been speaking Spanish for many years. Yes, and all that. Have you been there all day? No, until Sunday. And what? Have you been well? Yes. And lunch okay? It's the best! The best thing is eating there. Do you have any questions about Australia? Do you have any questions about Australia? Ask the teachers. Where does it fit there? Where does it fit there? What are the centers like? Are they like here? More or less. They are 10 to 18 years old. The criminal age is from 10 years to 18. The criminal age is from 10 years to 18. At 10 years old they can already enter a center. At 10 years old they can already enter a center. Are you not? Yes, very young. Very young. And what is the difference between those centers and those centers? And what is the difference between those centers and those centers? I don't know. He is very shy in Australia. He is very shy in Australia. The pin has two pins and then it rolls and rolls and rolls. The pin has two pins and then it rolls and rolls and rolls. And each door is very thick. And each door is very thick. And the trades have many keys. And the trades have many keys. And... Everything is a bit more of a cemetery. Everything is a bit more of a cemetery. A lot of blue. For some reason. Police. Police. He is very shy. It's been a long time since I don't know if I'm okay or not. He is very shy in Australia. He is very shy in Australia. He is very shy in Australia. He is very shy in Australia. He is very shy in Australia. And what about the centers? What about the centers? The centers have two doors. Some are jailers'. Bars? Yes. And all the workers have many keys. There are many areas that have to be opened. Like prison. And many doors. To go from one side to the other you have to open many doors. Like prison. Like prison. Yes Yes. The same as... The same, the same. And how do you find it here? I've seen it less. Actually. The best thing that has happened to me here is... the best thing that has happened to me is that I have been inside with him. The best thing that has happened to me is that I have been inside with him. And don't change, don't change. Yes, as you can. As you can. You speak, you speak. Come on, if I don't understand something I translate and if not, you understand. What will you be? Well, here we are fine, here we are fine. And what about the food? The food... Better than what happens to me. You want more. You want to eat more. No way. And he says it's better than at home. Yes. Well, there the food is what you have had. They are... Catering. They are catering, they are plastics where they heat up in the microwave and they give you a piece of... well... whatever there is. So... the food is not like that. Well, there you do have to kill for the food then. Of course. In other words, you take a salad, you talk and you eat it. I kill myself there with everything instead of... I kill myself with everything there. Another cow. Son of a bitch. What is the most important thing? Well actually I... if I hadn't arrived here maybe I wouldn't have changed. I think I would have continued stealing and everything. If I hadn't entered. Since the step is important. Yes Yes. That I have changed a lot here. The change, right? I have changed a lot. That you have changed. Yes. The way of seeing things and thinking. The way of thinking and that I no longer think when I go out... I no longer see... before I saw a woman with a purse and said... I hit her and I pull. Not anymore, not anymore. Not anymore, not anymore. Now it doesn't even cross my mind. Now I see a motorcycle with a car and it doesn't even cross my mind to steal it, you know? Of course, you are aware that it doesn't harm you. That it harms me a lot already. How old are you? Sixteen. And how much time do you have left of internment? Well, until September 10, 2025. The truth is that if I remember correctly, it was 22 months. Twenty-six, twenty-six is total. A long measure. Yes. What block are you in? Block 2. Block 2. For May... but I was going to go up to block 3 on March 18. Okay. What happens is that since they gave me four months, now I go up to May, for mid-May. I have already explained it in the other centers where he has been, but when there are such long stockings and they go from block to block 3 to block 4 and they go out on weekends, yes, weekend no, sometimes they even ask for an open regime, with which they go out every weekend, the next step is to ask for César, then. Normally all the Césars that we ask for in the CES are already in phase 4, in block 4, in block 5, they authorize it. That is to say, in principle if he finishes in September 2025 he has to go very badly, he has to lend himself very badly to be here until September 2025. Of course. The normal thing is that in May, in June, next year the César can be requested or even before, depending on his option. How is a typical day? The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. How is it done? It's just that every day is the same. Every day is the same. Every day. Except when you leave. On Sunday you don't leave at the same time as on Monday. So that's why. No, I mean it's the same. Structure. It's the same routine. Yes. Monday to quarters in the morning. But. We get up as a follower. Sometimes you go on excursions. We get up as a follower. And all those don't behave well. We get up following the 20 weeks. Then we clean. After. We have the workshop. After the workshop the food. And then the food. Then we have the storage. We have a workshop, after the workshop the food, then the nap, then the afternoon and the school. The important thing also is that since they are all in school, when the holidays come we also make them disconnect a bit. So we change the schedules. For example, these two weeks, Easter Week and this one that is not school either, they have changed the schedule a bit more playful, although they also have their reading workshop, their platform workshop like in Barcelona, but it is a bit more playful. So that they also disconnect a bit. I'm already thinking about arriving tomorrow night to do the departure sheet. But it is important for them too, since they are also required at school level, to put their batteries in for what also gives them a good holiday period. Man, of course. Totally. Things you would change about the center? From the center? The food. The food. Do you want more egg? No, we wanted something else. What do you want to eat? It's just that... Tell me, tell me. Pizza, pasta, pizza. You come out more matias of tomiso. You come out more matias of tomiso. Tuna sandwich. Tuna sandwich. With tomato. Or the TV, or that they pick up the cables later at night. That is, they are later. I want that way you have made a program. But before going back... Better instead of picking it up at eleven, at eleven thirty. No, directly... Wait, wait. Now I'll do it for you... Don't take it away from us directly. Wait, wait, wait. How many times do the children go to the rooms to sleep? It can be between six and seven. Between six and seven they are in their beds. Ugh! My goodness. It depends on the afternoons. In case you want to change to the side, you ask when you want. Yes. Do you want a baby there? A baby there? No way, I can't take it during the week. So what are they going to do? What are they going to ask for? Do they want it to be set at eleven thirty? Yes. At seven in the afternoon. Actually. Yes. How late? How late? Very late. And... Until what day? Until what time in the morning. At nine in the morning. At seven in the morning. Oh! My goodness. Let's see. If here, if from six... For anything... At seven in the afternoon, at nine in the morning. If for anything there are not enough workers, they all stay at their doors the next day. My goodness! So, they all stay in group separation without having done anything. Because they have to be in their... But can they have TV and all that there? They can only have TV. From the first day. There is no block. The first day you have TV you don't leave your room. And it is the only thing you can do. There is no... In school you decide if you want to go or you don't want to go. In workshops you decide if you want to go or you don't want to go. And you can't smoke? No, you can't smoke. No. No. No. No. You can't smoke. But... But... But... Nothing is done. The most important thing in those centers or the work that the workers do... There are no educators. They are only security. So, the job there is to prevent people from fighting. Like officials, right? They are officials. Same. Same. Prison officials where they arrive and are there. Try to separate people. Is there a problem? To your rooms, everyone. And if the officials hit you? They shouldn't hit you, but when it comes to going home, going home, going home, going home. But... But... But there was a case where they have given. They have given a couple of sticks there, right? But what you have to do, what they do of... They prevent. You know how not to get angry with anyone. You don't leave the room and you don't get angry with anyone. That's the letter. I'm not going there, I'm not going. And he, his job, or what we are trying and we are helping, is to try to change there how we are working with the kids and help them to want... It is spoken as here. So, if you had to give a message to the Government, to tell the kids there, this is not going to work or whatever, what would you tell the people who are there? Well, that they put the centers there the same, the same rules as here. There are many rules here, yes. Yes. Yes. And do you like that there are many rules or not? No, we don't like it, but that's how people reform. Yes, right? Yes. But nobody likes rules. I don't like going 120 kilometers per hour on the road, I don't like it. But it is the rule and I know that if I go over it, it crunches me in life. But well, life itself. The good thing is that here you pick up some habits, that if you didn't have those rules, maybe you go home and make the bed or help your mother in the kitchen, or something like that, that the family appreciates that. Me, if I at home, on leave, I picked up the plates from the table and my father was left, what are you doing? What are you doing? My father was left, what are you doing? Because you don't see that I don't pick up the plates, right? But see, you didn't do conduct. Of course. That's it. What do you think is changing in your mind when you are going to leave? What do you think you have already changed? What things do you think you have changed yourselves since you have been here? That when you go home you are already outside. By the way of thinking, the way of acting too, the way of speaking. With more respect? Yes, with more respect and all that. Do they help more, as you just said? Of course, they help more. Empathize, come on. Of course. Empathize. And that they also leave you the nonsense. Well, and you will see your parents happier too. Yes Yes. If my sister every time my mom calls me she tells me. And your father is... And also Alba, since she knows my father from outside and he is in his quiet and all that, she says... Every time I ask my father, my father is always left flipping. He is left, he is left... He is left happy, you know? Of how I'm going here. I forget that, but the one you're changing is something. Yes. Did you understand what happened when he went home and after eating, he put all the plates in the sink and the father said, what the hell are you doing? You have never done this. Yes Yes. And what do you think of adult prison, I suppose, in terms of what you want to do? In the future? Yes, what they want to do. In the future? Yes, what they want to do. In the future? Yes, but they want to make sure it's not something they think. And what do you think of your future? What are you going to do? Or have you thought about prison? I work. Do you want to work? To work. In what? To work. To work. In whatever? You work in whatever. To work. Also in whatever? As long as you don't have to take. Everything works. It is the best way. Of course, work, take your money home and that's it. Work and study as much as you can. Of course, work and study as much as you can. Work and study as much as you can. Yes, that's the idea. To avoid going to study, work and study. And what do you think was the main reason that brought you here? And what do you think...? What was...? Not that you talk about your causes. What were the reasons that you think made it open? Well, not listening to my family. Not listening to my father. Because my father told me to stop, that one day I was going to see myself here and I didn't listen to him. I kept going and going. And in the end I entered. All of them the same. Not follow what my parents were saying to me. Did you go to school before being here? I was going to high school but most of the class I skipped. When I entered I didn't even know how to add. I didn't even know how to add when I entered. Why weren't you going to go? Of course. And now? Now yes. And now? Now yes. And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? Now I do know. Before I failed everything. Now I pass it. Before I was failing everything and now I am passing all the exams. So, now they have had a little bit of Australian detention. Do they have any like, if they got to meet an Australian young person, what would they say to them like in terms of what it is like here? If right now I met someone who was a young person who was in school, I don't know if that would be something I could have done. What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? Yes, right now I knew someone who was in school, I don't know if it was a young young person. What would you have told them? What would you have told them? If right now you met a kid from Australia who is in a center, what would you explain to him and what happens here in this type of sheds? Imagine, we introduce you to one who is in a center there and so on and we say, look, how does that work? Look. There are many rules, I would tell him. You would tell him that there are many rules. Of course. That it is good to have many rules or that there are many and at first they are hard. At first it costs, it costs. It costs a bit but you get used to the rules. And they are positive in the end. Of course. And one thing that I would surely tell him is that the more type you are and the less you think you are. And that if you want to get out on leave you have to comply. If you don't comply you don't get out. Of course. Good. But in the end the rules that are in the center are very important. The rule that is here, the schedule, is what we have any person in any house. Of course. And any job. Of course. So that is what you have not had in the end. Yeah. Yes Yes. And the street has taken you here. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't listen to your parents' indication, right? Of course. What you are saying. Of course. And the relationship with what I had done, what I had done I am david david jesus how are you I didn't screw up. I didn't screw up. I didn't screw up. I didn't screw up. I didn't screw up.

Well, there the food is what you have had. They are... Catering. They are catering, they are plastics where they are heated in the microwave and they give you a piece of... well... whatever there is. So... the food is not like that. Well, there you do have to kill for food then. Of course. In other words, you give yourself a salad, you talk and you eat it. I kill myself there with everything instead of... I kill myself with everything there. Another cow. Son of a bitch. What is the most important thing? Well, actually I... if I didn't arrive here, maybe I wouldn't have changed. I think I would have continued stealing and everything. If it hadn't entered. Since the step is important. Yes Yes. That I have changed a lot here. The change, right? I have changed a lot. That you have changed. Yes. The way of seeing things and thinking. The way of thinking and that I no longer think when I go out... I no longer see... before I saw a woman with a bag and said... I hit her and I stretch her. Not anymore, not anymore. Not anymore, not anymore. Now it doesn't even cross my mind. Now I see a motorcycle with a car and it doesn't even cross my mind to steal it, you know? Of course, you are aware that it doesn't harm you. That it already harms me a lot. How old are you? Sixteen. And how much time do you have left of internment? Well, until September 10, 2025. The truth is that if I remember correctly, it was 22 months. Twenty-six, twenty-six is total. A long measure. Yes. What block are you in? Block 2. Block 2. By May... but I was going to go up to block 3 on March 18th. Okay. What happens is that since they gave me four months, now I go up in May, mid-May. I have already explained it in the other centers that he has been, but when they are such long stockings and they go from block to block 3 to block 4 and they go out on weekends yes, every other weekend, sometimes they even ask for an open regime, with which they go out every weekend, the next step is to ask for the Caesar, then. Normally all the Caesars that we ask for in the CEIs are already in phase 4, in block 4, in block 5, they authorize it. In other words, in principle if he finishes in September '25, he has to go very badly, he has to perform very badly to be here until September '25. Sure. The normal thing is that in May, in June, next year you can ask for the Caesar or even before, depending on your option. What is a typical day like? The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. The typical day. How is it done? It's just that every day is the same. Every day is the same. Every day. Except when you leave. On Sunday you don't leave at the same time as on Monday. So, because of that. No, I mean it's the same. Structure. It's the same routine. Yes. From Monday to Wednesday in the morning. But. We get up as a follower. Sometimes you go on excursions. We get up as a follower. And all those don't behave well. We get up as a follower at 20 weeks. Then we clean. After. We have the workshop. After the workshop lunch. And then lunch. Then we have storage. We have a workshop, after the workshop lunch, then a nap, then the afternoon and school. The important thing is also that since they are all in school, when vacations come we also make them disconnect a bit. So we change the schedules. For example, these two weeks, Easter and this one that is not school either, they have changed the schedule a bit more playful, although they also have their reading workshop, their platform workshop like in Barcelona, but it is a bit more playful. So that they also disconnect a bit. I'm already thinking that I'll arrive tomorrow night to do the departure sheet. But it is important for them too, as they are required at a school level too, to put the batteries on so it also gives them a good vacation period. Man, of course. Totally. Things you would change about the center? From the center? The food. The food. Do you want more egg? No, we wanted something different. What do you want to eat? It's just that... Tell me, tell me. Pizza, pasta, pizza. You go out more tomatoes. You go out more tomatoes. Tuna sandwich. Tuna sandwich. With tomato. Or the TV, or that they pick up the cables later at night. That is, they are later. I want you to have done a program like that. But before returning... Better instead of picking it up at eleven, at eleven thirty. No, directly... Wait, wait. Now I'll do it for you... Don't take it away from us directly. Wait, wait, wait. How many times do children go to the rooms to sleep? It can be between six and seven. Between six and seven they are in their beds. Ugh! My goodness. It depends on the afternoons. In case you want to change sides, ask whenever you want. Yes. Do you want a baby there? A baby there? No way, I can't stand it in a week. So what are they going to do? What are they going to ask for? Do they want it to be eleven thirty? Yes. At seven in the afternoon. Actually. Yes. How late? How late? Very late. And ... Until what day? Until what time in the morning. At nine in the morning. At seven in the morning. Oh! My goodness. Let's see. If here, if from six... For anything... At seven in the afternoon, at nine in the morning. If for anything there are not enough workers, they all stay in their doors the next day. My goodness! So, they all stay in group separation without having done anything. Because they have to be in their... But, can they have TV and all that there? They can only have TV. From day one. There is no block. The first day you have TV it doesn't come out of your room. And it's the only thing you can do. There is no ... At school you decide if you want to go or not. In workshops you decide if you want to go or not. And you can't smoke? No, you can't smoke. No. No. No. No. You can not smoke. But ... But ... But ... Nothing is done. The most important thing in those centers or the work that the workers do... There are no educators. They are only security. So, the work there is to prevent people from hitting each other. Like officials, right? They are officials. Same. Same. Prison officials where they arrive and they are there. Try to separate people. Is there any problem? To your rooms, everyone. And if the officers hit you? They shouldn't hit you, but when it comes to going home, to home, to home, to home. But ... But ... But there was a case where they have been given. They have been given a couple of sticks there, right? But, what you have to do, what they do... They prevent. You know how you don't get mad at anyone. You don't leave the room and you don't get mad at anyone. That is the letter. I'm not going there, I'm not going. And he, his work, or what we are trying to do and we are helping, is to try to change there how they are working with the kids and help them to want ... It is spoken like here. So, if you had to give a message to the Government, to say there, guys, this is not going to work or whatever, what would you say to the people who are there? Well, that they put the centers there the same, the same rules as here. There are many rules here, yes. Yes. Yes. And do you like that there are many rules or not? No, we don't like it, but that's how people reform. Yes, right? Yes. But nobody likes the rules. I don't like going 120 per hour on the road, I don't like it. But it is the norm and I know that if I go over it, it crunches me in life. But well, life itself. The good thing is that here you pick up some habits, that if you didn't have those rules, maybe that you go to your house and make the bed or help your mother in the kitchen, or something like that, that the family appreciates that. Me, if I in my house, on the permit, I picked up the plates from the table and my father stayed, what are you doing? What are you doing? My father stayed, what are you doing? Because you don't see that I don't pick up the dishes, right? But see, you didn't drive. Sure. That's it. What do they think is changing in their mind when they are going to leave? What do you think they have already changed? What things do you think you have changed yourselves since you have been here? That when you go home you are already outside. Because of the way of thinking, the way of acting too, the way of speaking. With more respect? Yes, with more respect and all that. Do they help more, as he just said? Of course, they help more. Empathize, come on. Sure. Empathize. And they leave you the nonsense too. Well, and you will see your parents happier too. Yes Yes. If my sister every time my mom calls me she tells me. And your father is... And also Alba, since she knows my father from outside and he is in his silence and all that, she says... Every time I ask my father, my father always stays flipping out. He stays, he stays... He stays happy, you know? Of how I'm going here. I forget that, but the one you're changing is something. Yes. Did you understand what happened when he went home and after eating, he put all the dishes in the dishwasher and the father said, what the hell are you doing? You've never done this. Yes Yes. And what do you think of adult prison, I suppose, in terms of what you want to do? In the future? Yes, what they want to do. In the future? Yes, what they want to do. In the future? Yes, but they want to make sure it's not something they think. And what do you think about your future? What are you going to do? Or have you thought about prison? I work. Do you want to work? Work. In what? To work. To work. In anything? You work on anything. To work. In anything too? As long as you don't have to take. All work. It's the best way. Of course, work, bring your money home and that's it. Work and study as much as you can. Of course, work and study as much as you can. Work and study as much as you can. Yes, that's the idea. To avoid going to study, work and study. And what do you think was the main reason that brought you here? And what do you think was...? Which was...? Not that you talk about your causes. What were the reasons that you think made you end up opening? Well, not listening to my family. Not listening to my father. Because my father told me to stop, that one day I would see myself here and I did not listen to him. I kept going and going. And in the end it came in. All of them the same. Not follow what my parents were saying to me. Did you go to school before being here? I went to high school but most of the class I skipped. When I came in I didn't even know how to add. I didn't even know how to add when I came in. Why wouldn't you go? Sure. And now? Now yes. And now? Now yes. And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? Now I do know. Before I failed everything. Now I pass it. Before I was failing everything and now I am passing all the exams. So, now they have had a little bit of out Australian detention. Do they have any like, if they got to meet an Australian young person, what would they say to them like in terms of what it is like here? If right now I met someone who was a young person who was in school, I don't know if that would be something I could have done. What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? What would you have told them? Yes, right now I knew someone who was in school, I don't know if it was a young young person. What would you have told them? What would you have told them? If right now you met a guy from Australia who is in a center, what would you explain and what happens here in this type of sheds? Imagine, we introduce you to one who is in a center there and so on and we say, look, how does that work? Look. There are many rules, I would tell him. You would tell him that there are many rules. Sure. That it is good to have many rules or that there are many and at first they are hard. At first it costs, it costs. It costs a bit but you get used to the rules. And they are positive in the end. Sure. And one thing that I would surely tell him is that the more you are and the less you think you are. And that if you want to leave the permit you have to fulfill it. If you don't fulfill it, you don't leave. Sure. Good. But after all, the rules in the center are very important. The rule here, the schedule, is what we have any person in any house. Sure. And any job. Sure. So that in the end is what you haven't had. Already. Yes Yes. And the street has taken you here. Already. Already. And you don't pay attention to the indication of your parents, right? Sure. What are you saying. Sure. And the relationship with the workers what? Well, good. You have to know how to handle them, you have to know how to handle them. Man. You have to know how to handle them.\n",

      "Transcript": "For breakfast? Oh, eggs on toast? So boring. Yeah, that's good. Eggs on toast is cool. Okay. And... Wait. And I think the sun's not going to hurt me this time. Okay, I'm going to record. Start recording. When I record, that's another booboo. Do I look at you like there? So yeah, you can just straight my eyes. So what I've done is just created my eye line, which is... Oh, okay. Yeah. Cool. So just start with your name and if you can spell it for me, that's great. Yep. It's Ashley Choice. A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H-C-H-O-I-C-E. Good choice. Amazing. Tell me a little story about you in how many words you want. Oh, about me. I am a data analyst. I... It's hard talking about yourself, I think. I like to... I play inline hockey locally in Mackay, which is a lot of fun. It's a cool community. It's very casual. I volunteer here, which I really love. I like to do a lot kind of out in the community and be part of people in Mackay and what's going on. So I get a lot of life from that and from people. But I'm also probably a little bit of a hermit because I'm studying at the moment as well. And I have two kids. And raising. Sorry, I look at you. Yeah, look at me. Casual. Casual. Casual. Yeah. So I'm fairly busy just between kids and work and study and hockey and yeah. Wow. Fantastic. Fantastic. Tell us a bit about your role at the Horizon. I work in Horizon Network in their asset performance team. So we look after all of the assets that you could think of that keeps the train running through the network in central Queensland. And I look after the condition and what does condition look like for those assets so we can better maintain them. So I work in a data science area of that. Cool. What's Horizon do in your words? For me, what does Horizon do? Particularly in network, we look after this system that enables trains to move from mine to port. And also we look after bulk and parts of the network that are not. Parts of the network that have transportation trains as well. So we are a big employer in the regional communities and it really a big pusher for keeping jobs in regions. We do have a Brisbane office, but our biggest footprint is all the way from Gladstone in the south up to Bowen in the north and in Townsville for bulk as well. So I think that they're all about, they are a coal business. But it's really a much bigger plan around keeping regional jobs in the community, supporting community groups. Cool. On those values, how do you think that aligns with what I was trying to achieve? Horizon is really focused on how our vision is around, I guess, people and how we engage in that. And I think that's how we perform. It's not really about KPIs and performance. It's about integrity and how do we maintain that integrity and how do we engage not just within our organisation but the groups around. We deal a lot with a vast array of different people in the community and it's about how do we... I hate interviews. Sorry. No, just take your time. It doesn't need to be perfect. It's just about how we engage. I think that's really important. I think that's really important. I think that's really important. I think that's really important. I think that's really important. It doesn't need to be perfect either, by the way. Yeah. I think that particularly is why I like working for Network because I think it's less focused on the coal side of things and my value is more aligned with that. They're much more people focused, I think. Probably take that out because coal is going to get... Coal will get very mad about that. That's a good... Yeah. Say that every time. Yeah, yeah. Take that bit out. Okay, good. Yeah. That's cool. What's it feel like for you to come down to Orange Sky? I really love it. I've gotten a lot out of being here. My favourite part about being and coming down to Orange Sky is the conversations. I enjoy just the breadth and different types of people that you get to talk to, not just the volunteers but the people who attend the service as well. I've made a lot of connections with different people that I really love and enjoy. And I find it's been really great. And I try and encourage a lot of people from my work to sign up and join as well and really want people to be a part of it because I think it has changed how I then talk to people even at work, even with family and friends because it can be challenging. Conversations can be challenging and there's a lot of growth in that. And I think there's an incredible, beautiful thing when you can talk to people and have challenging conversations and hear challenging things sometimes. And really reflect on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And reflect personally on that. And just I think it changes who you are. And you can grow with people with that long-term connection as well. That's a job. And, like, fundraising is hard. Fundraising is hard. And you did a really great job. Why did you first feel compelled to do it? And how did you go about it? The Sudsy Challenge was really the start of my journey into Orange Sky. Um, Horizon is a funder, a key funder of Orange Sky. And, um, I think it was the start of my journey into Orange Sky. that was being promoted within our organisation and I knew, I know Paul Gordon, I knew he was volunteering down here, so I thought why not start there and see what that's like and kind of be involved in the group. I managed to convince my entire team to be part of it, which was a lot of fun and I think it was just getting a bit creative around how we entice people to be part of that challenge and if they, not just if they want to partake as a team in our team group, then how can I get them involved in part of what is Orange Sky and there's nothing like a cupcake that sells that to people. Food is always good, so I used a bit of that to convince people to get involved and yeah. That's cool. Was there a particular part of it that created challenging conversations around it and is there, do you need to change your, your approach to it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it created a lot of curiosity with people, particularly in the same office that I was working with and quite shocked that, oh, you really, you're really wearing like really like a lot of, and very, I, what I didn't expect out of the challenge was the quite personal conversation people would have around, you're really wearing this, like everything the same, are you? Um, and I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I was a bit, oh, this is a lot to talk about with people. This is a lot actually. And they had to reframe that and think, actually there are people who, this is a very real thing and part of their life and why shy away from that conversation with people that you, particularly people you're working with, it's probably a safer conversation to have. And for others though, who just kind of go, oh, yeah, okay. Another thing I think then it's just about, well, it's a great, it was more about them than what is Orange Sky and what do we do? And it's more than just washing clothes. We're not here just to wash and provide washing services for people. We're here for connection and conversation and it's rephrasing that as part of it. Awesome. Um, do your kids get involved and do you talk to them about Orange Sky? I talk to them about it all the time. Um, they're too young. Can we, sorry, can we, yeah, like, um, like if I said, what, what do you have for breakfast? What breakfast I have? Yeah. So if I do, yeah, do you employ the kids? Can you say like, um, yeah, with the kids or something? Or is it, is that my example? No, sorry. So just repeat the question. So if like, if I say, what do you have for breakfast? You would say full breakfast, right? Oh, okay. Yeah. I see what you're saying. The rest of it was fine. I could pick it up on that. Yeah. No, that's okay. Um, so the kids, they're too young to come down here and I, my daughter will be in grade 10 at Mercy soon and so she'll be able to come down and do volunteering with Brekkie Club, which I'm looking forward to. Um. But it's been really good. They see me in the morning every second Friday, don my orange sky shirt and it's been a really good conversation with them about what it looks like for families and that there are kids their age here sometimes. And um, there's a little guy who comes along who is deep into Pokemon and designs his own Pokemon and I have, I really love talking to him. He is just so in and he's so creative and incredible and taking that and back and talking to my son. And he's also so into Pokemon as well and saying, you'll never believe this kid who comes. He has the most incredible drawings and being able to share that more relatable level of conversation with the kids so they can say, oh, this is something that, you know, it isn't, it affects so many different people and being able to model that for them. And yeah, I think taking those stories back. That's cool. That's awesome. Um, what's your plans for the future with Orange Sky? Like is there things you'd like to do with Orange Sky? Are you sticking around? What's the plan? My plan with Orange Sky is definitely sticking around. I've loved it. I've been here since August, I think August, September last year. Um, and I'm now the community engagement coordinator so that I started that at the start of this year and I just released my first newsletter. I was very pumped about a bit nervous. Um, I was kind of nervous about doing that one, but, and I do the social media posts as well. When I kind of get on there. But, um, I think for my plans and what I want to do with Orange Sky is I'd like to be able to, once the kids get a bit older, build my capacity to volunteer more shifts. I only do Friday and maybe every second Friday and I wouldn't mind being able to do shifts. I travel a lot for work. I traveled to Rocky and we just opened a service in Rocky, which I'm super pumped about. Um, so maybe when I start traveling and I go down to Brisbane is to try and link up with a few other services and volunteer at those locations. Yeah. And just to build a bit more connection in the community at different places around Australia. So. That's so cool. Yeah. Um, are you, um, what's your like, um, what's your feeling around what, um, Orange Sky can sort of achieve in Mackay, I guess. Do you think there's still growth to happen and what do you think can happen in the community? I think there's a lot more growth to happen, particularly in the Serena community. I think there's a lot more that can do. I'm not as involved in Serena as Mackay just because of location and being up here. There's definitely a lot of growth and I think we have an incredible, um, connection with a lot of other community organizations here in Mackay to build that network. Um, I'd love to see maybe another location in the Northern Beaches area if there was a possibility to support that. Because, um, being in the center of Mackay is quite a spread out. Yeah. Town. Um, we're a great centralized location for a lot of people. It's very visible here, um, in the city, but it would be amazing to see if there was something where it could be supported on the North side as well for people who might not be able to make it all the way in. Um, I think there's a lot that we can do in terms of conversation with other organizations for how we can promote what they're doing as well in terms of support for services and attending a lot of community events. And that's probably something that I'd like to be in trying, um, growing and being more involved in as well as more of that community group or community awareness kind of forums. There's, um, some in Serena and some in Mackay that I'm going to start coming along to and just learning and connecting with other groups and people and just seeing who else is out there and letting that be part of the conversation back here with our, because sometimes we might be a bit more connected directly with people than some other areas are. Yeah. So cool. Was there anything else that you wanted to say that we didn't get to? Um, not anything but everything. Sorry for the ride.\n",

So all you need to do is actually I'm gonna do this as well because I always forget I built this app just for this reason. Oh, wow. Forget to use, okay. Yeah, sure. That's not a useful app then if you don't use it. Yeah. It's not useful. You don't use it.\n\nYeah. That's the first rule. Okay. So you just need to tell me your full name and then spell it out for me. Yep. So Sivan Lane, S-I-O-B-H-A-N. Sorry, one more time. I just totally didn't get that. Yeah. SSIO. Yep. BHAN. Yep. Yep. My surname is L-E-Y-N-E-L-E-Y? Yeah. NE. Amazing. And would you prefer email or phone number to send stuff through?\n\nEmail's fine. Which is sivan Fair. So SIO.

I was like, I had this one thing I need to change and I didn't. Ah, yeah. Look, they're on it. I can hear the machine. I'm so tuned in to listening to the machine. That's all part of the story. Yeah. And we are at the early morning shift. No, this is into the village.\n\nBlue door. Blue door. Blue door shift. Yeah.\n\nCool. Let's start off with a little bit of this sh vo. Is that right? Yeah. Story. What's the shavonne story? A little bit of it. Oh. Where do you want me to start? Start from the very beginning. You don't go away. Hours. Hours. Yeah. Whenever you want. I guess I quit my job in [00:02:00] 2021 and was looking for some stuff to do around camera because, got tired of my job, which is why I quit it. My partner retired, so it was a great opportunity to change life. So we now spend a lot of time on creative projects at home and dogs and craft and art and all the rest of it. And this is a volunteer thing. We do Orange sky, which I like because it's contained to one thing and it's one good thing.\n\nSo good. Yeah. Where did you first hear about Orange Sky? Like when's it first pop up? I was just Googling for volunteer opportunities in Canberra and there were a lot, which were, took a lot more commitment than this. We all want you to commit for four days a week, three hours a day. It was like, I don't want to do that 'cause I wanna be living my life at the same time.\n\nSo this just felt like a really nice commitment to. I knew what I was doing and it's what I always say about orange sky. I like that I come for two hours, once a fortnight and once a week, and I know what I'm doing in those two hours. So I think I just Google it and it came up that way and it suited me, like I'm [00:03:00] really attuned, obviously, to the washing machines.\n\nAs soon as they go off, I'm ready to jump up and do the washing.\n\nWhat is it that keeps, so you've passed on what's your connection to it and that sort of stuff? What keeps you coming back? I like the friends. We have really good conversations and we see the same group because Canberra is so small, I've been on a number of different shifts. So you end up seeing the same people that from shift to shift and even when you are not seeing the same people or you've got shifts like this without any friends turning up 'cause it's cold and wet.\n\nI like that I'm doing something really practical for someone and it, there's a very basic dignity in providing someone with clean clothes. And we've had some volunteers on other shifts who, it wasn't enough for them. They wanted to do more, they wanted to fix more. They wanted to get in and do stuff.\n\nAnd it's I can really respect the basic dignity of clothes and clean clothes and how good that makes someone feel. So that's what makes me keep coming back at, I find it personally very satisfying just to do a really [00:04:00] basic thing for someone. Why do you think the friends keep coming back? I think they like us as a captive audience for sure.\n\nSo one of the friends you just met as you were setting up, he just likes having a captive audience to talk to. And I think and he is interesting and we engage with him and he knows all of the Orange Sky volunteers across Canberra. But I also think people don't talk to him much in life. And so we are a regular people who talk to him and know about his life and ask him questions.\n\nAnd so I think that's, and that's rewarding for him anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Is there things that you have learned along your time at Orange Sky that you maybe didn't know before or other things that have changed in your perceptions of things or I think that it's just made me really aware to stay humble with my own life.\n\nLike I know I'm in a privileged position to be not working full-time at the moment and enjoying what I enjoy in my life and my safe and secure housing. And it's just normal here. Yeah. And it just makes me really aware to [00:05:00] just be grateful for things. And we had a shift earlier this summer. It was so hot.\n\nIt was like 36 degrees and we're all complaining about sweating. And then one of the friends came saying that the storm, the night before the lightning had hit the footpath beside him. He was sleeping rough. He didn't like to be indoors. And we thought, no, we'll just stop complaining about our problems with the heat.\n\nRight now, actually, and it's funny, Ainsley Village, I used to work 20 years ago, I worked for a drug needle service. So we used to exchange clean fits and we would not come here 'cause it was too dangerous. So the fact that orange sky can now be here is a real change in Canberra and the environment and.\n\nAnd I really like seeing that. I like that there's safe places. This has now become a safe place for people where it's not a safe place for people. 20 years ago when I was working that job, so Wow. It's good. So it's nice. It's just nice to see the other side of Canberra, which is incredibly privileged.\n\nPeople have a lot of money here. Every time I go to do like a pottery class and I can't afford it, [00:06:00] I just think canberrans have far too much money. So I like seeing the diversity of Canberra. Yeah. What are those conversations you have with more socially, with friends, family or broader public around what you do?\n\nIs there ways in which do you change the way you talk about stuff depending on who you're talking to? Or do people have different perceptions of it, or how's that for you? I don't think I change depending on what people are, who people are. I'm pretty open and upfront, but I do make sure I talk about.\n\nThe volunteer work we do and some of the stories we get from friends, because I do recognize that Canberra ands have a lot of money and they're very privileged and a lot of my friends are now either senior public servants or retiring public servants, and they are so wealthy and they do not see the side of Canberra where people are not as wealthy as them, or they're having to use food services or laundry services or access the parts of life that wealthy Canberrans don't know exist.\n\nSo I like to share some of [00:07:00] the stories we get from people and some of some of the guys who come here have such interesting lives and they've lived all over the country and they've done such interesting things and they've found themselves in a position where they no longer have secure housing or they no longer have the supportive family and friends.\n\nAnd I do find that important to share with people so they don't just keep living in that Canberra. Privileged environment. And friends of mine have come to volunteer here or they make donations 'cause that's all they want to do. And I don't insist on that with people, but I just, I think it's nice for people to stay aware of what's happening in Canberra.\n\nWhat are like the practical things that you appreciate around or don't appreciate around, like when you, like Orangeburg's quite a big organization. Yeah. Are there things that easy, difficult because of that or have you seen a change? Does it grow or what's that like for you? I, as it's grown, I think it's a bit more data focused.\n\nSo I find the volunteer check in checkout quite frustrating and it's like I, [00:08:00] when you've got 12 loads of washing lined up, you're not actually thinking about that sort of thing. And I know that's a priority for the organization and I know. From auditing and all of that, it's important, but also it's oh crap, I got to sign in.\n\nDamn it. But the thing I really like about Orange Sky is that there are rules around what we can and can't do. And there, there is a structure and I never feel pressured to do more. I volunteered for organizations where it's six months later I'm exhausted and I do not wanna volunteer again. Yeah.\n\nBecause I know personally I have a hard time saying no, which is I think common amongst people who volunteer for any kind of organization. So I like that there is structure with it, and I think that's something Orange Sky should keep. They don't impose too much of their volunteers. They never ask too much.\n\nLike I know there are some vacant positions at the moment in the senior positions within Canberra, and there is no pressure to apply for those. I really like that. Because it just means I can come and do my thing, and I [00:09:00] find that satisfying, like I get a lot more outta the organization than they do out of me coming and doing the washing, just in terms of personally find it rewarding.\n\nSo yeah, it is just the focus on facts and figures, but that's every organization, and I know it's important for funding and my little public service heart appreciates it. But yeah, I always forget to do it too. Awesome. Yeah, that's practical, like feedback and yeah, super appreciated. Appreciated. Yeah, for sure.\n\nCool. Is there anything we didn't get to that you would talk about? I don't think so. I don't think I have, I like just heading up and doing the washing and going home, so I don't think there's a huge story there. It is just what it is. The whole picture of it was amazing. Yeah. Good. All right.\n\nI'm gonna take a photo.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "# Marcus Barlow\n**Marcus:** [00:00:00] My full name is Marcus, M-A-R-C-U-S Barlow, B-A-R-L-O-W. And Oliver Ryan. Yeah. Cool.\nJust as Marcus unemployed. Normally I don't tell people immediately where I live or what I do. If they ask, I'd say I was, I used to be a security guard. Nothing special. Just patrols, night patrols and things like that. And it was a good paying job. But it gets pretty boring after a while.\nI've got a pretty good room. To be honest, it's like a motel room almost. Not like a, it's not huge, but I've got everything that I need. I've got a TV and and bathroom facilities, so that's not a problem.\nI'm quiet, I like reading a lot, so that suits me just perfectly. And we live right next to town, so that's perfect.\nThey don't cost any money. They're locked overnight for security reasons. And you can just take your clothes and wash them. The problem only [00:01:00] is that the tendency was that if you left your clothes here, for a period of time and didn't wait or you hung your clothes on a line, then they'd just disappear no matter what the quality of your clothing was.\nWhen I first heard that there was a service and it wasn't actually first here, it was at St. John's, which is just down the road. And I could take my clothes and they'd be washed for me. I just thought that was fantastic. But having said that, I'd always heard I'd originally heard of Orange Sky on the TV when they were just beginning in Queensland, I think.\nAnd when they had, they were talking about these vans and they were for the homeless, and they had, it was like a I've always got my ear open for homeless services because it's, that's an important thing to me. My background is Christian, I'm very aware of the homelessness issue and I always tend to notice homeless stories on the tv.\nOr about the homeless or homeless services. So I'd heard about this service. They bring the van and they've [00:02:00] got showers and they've got, washing facilities. They'll do your washing, they'll return it to you, and then, and you're free to go. And you can go.\nSorry, I'm free to go. And also, of course, the first thing I found out was that. You could just leave it there and come back and I did that the first couple of times, but then I got talking to the people because I didn't know what kind of people they were. But as I got talking to them, I realized they weren't they weren't just average people, which is okay.\nPeople can be friendly without necessarily being great conversationalists or very social. But I. The the thing was that the people were very friendly and they seemed across the board quite intelligent. They had good interpersonal skills. They had a level of sincerity about them.\nThat was quite engaging. Engaging. And and that was what kind of, it drew me in. I'm not one to be drawn in. To, to false sales pictures or scams. I'm just too [00:03:00] old for that, but I do I. Yeah, I just liked the people and the more that I came back and talked with them, the more I enjoyed their interaction.\nI realized then it's not necessarily, they don't become your friends and you don't necessarily go on to socialize with them afterwards. But that wasn't the issue. The point was you could sit there and two hours would pass and you wouldn't even notice it because of these really great people.\nIf you like, it's also it's not like a psychologist where you go to a or there's this idea, there's an idea, not the whole, but there's this idea that when you go to a psychologist, the psychologist talks to you directly and deals with your problems directly and interacts you with and helps you directly.\nThat's the focus of the whole thing. And the issue with me is I've got post-traumatic stress disorder. From doing security work, I think I, it, it came on while I was doing security work, but the doctor said it can be caused by anything. And I'm okay. I am on [00:04:00] medication. I'm okay, but again.\nIt people, it would come up in conversation with people. And they would ask me how I felt. And they were really supportive. And one person would say, oh, I understand because I'm experiencing that myself. There was one lady who I think she may have been exert an person, I'm not sure.\nAnd then there's other people who've had members of their staff or members of their family who've dealt with the same thing and they. And they know exactly where you are, and they remember, and so next time you come back, if you're feeling a bit uncomfortable or if you look tired or they're just really supportive, and it's just that genuine look.\nIf you just wanna sit there and talk to us and relax, we'll keep you entertained. We'll bring chocolates, you can drink coffee. And we can just talk about stuff. And the conversation doesn't even necessarily have to be that involved. It can become very useful stuff.\nLike I said the people tend to be [00:05:00] the people who volunteer for Orange Sky. I. Tend to be older, more experienced, and I guess also that they're screened differently. And so the person who's responsible for screening and managing and hiring the volunteers is obviously a very insightful person.\nAnd I can see that too. And it come, definitely shows that's the issue. And that's what I love. Those are all the things I love about it. And when I go home at, afterwards, like I'll go home with my washing. I've got everything. It's all there, it's all ready. And so this afternoon I have to go to the gym.\nI I need to train 'cause I've got high blood pressure. I have to train every do aerobics because of my high blood pressure and my, I have to keep my weight down. And so the fact that I've got t-shirts and shorts available every time I've got my towels available, I've got everything.\nIt's all washed. I don't have to do it myself. And then it's Tuesday and Friday, same routine, orange sky gym. And then I've got my clothes for the gym for the rest of the [00:06:00] week.\nIt's reassuring. Because I come back and people say, Hey Marcus, how you going? Are you okay? What's happening? What are you doing? And I find myself talking about say, oh, I've been reading a lot this week.\nI've been reading more. And then a week later I'll come back and somebody else will say, Hey, if you mean, what did you read this week? What did you watch on tv? And that's important to me because with recovering from the PTSD essentially PTSD is is like a form of shock. And a form of kind of you feel anxiety or even terror for just no reason.\nAnd so what you need to do. And the doctor, even one doctor even told me that some people just never recover from PTSD. So there's a number of things you have to do. Take medication. I need to and not just lie in bed because that's the thing. You get up in the morning and just go, I just don't wanna do anything, but if I do that, then it's that old thing, use it or lose it. And don't let boredom take control of your life. And reading, [00:07:00] getting up, just that thing. Getting up, going to orange sky, getting up, going to the gym, going to lunch, having lunch, going to bed. It's like you have to really make yourself, sometimes you have to force yourself to do it, but it's really important because what's happening effectively is that my mind is becoming more.\nCo more calm and a lot of that has to do with and I've even told them the, I've even, because I've been coming here for years now, I think probably about at least eight years. Which is a lot of visits, and, and the people are just, they're just so kind. And I've even said to them, look, I probably would've managed without you, but you guys have just been so helpful and friendly and kind and reassuring.\nAnd it in a sense, it does give you a goal where oh yeah, today's Tuesday I've got, and you've got, it got something to do. You don't know necessarily who's gonna be on, or you might know because somebody said, oh, I'll see you next Tuesday, or whatever. [00:08:00] But again that's the most critical thing for me personally, is that it keeps, it's keeps the ball rolling, so to speak.\nIt keeps you moving forward. It gives you something to do. Yeah. And that's critical for me. Yeah.\nI just, part of my appreciation of orange sky and what I like about it and why I say I like Orange Sky and what they're doing is because I can, I think to a certain extent, I can see the purpose and I can see that the purpose is not just to wash people's clothes.\nBecause then it would be completely different. But the purpose is to for example, I come from a Christian background and I've read a lot of books about the Catholic church and the church in the old days. When there were no cities and there were no there everything depended on the church.\nThe church was the center of the village. And so if anyone wanted money or they wanted help or they wanted to they would go to the church and everyone from that village would go to church and. [00:09:00] Helping the poor was critical in those times because the, and so the monasteries did that and people did that and people really, it was part of their, the way.\nBut in a situation where people ignore the homeless or ignore the poor, or ignore the sick or the frail or the elderly, and the list goes on and on. We live in a society where first of all, there's a fear that if I become old or frail or poor or elderly I won't survive. I'll just rot on the side of the street and I'll die.\nBut in a society where people are actively, proactively going out, looking for you. Giving you pamphlets, giving you church pamphlets, telling you, oh, do you know about the blue door? Do you know about Own Village? Do you know about First Point the homeless services? Do you not, and do you know about orange sky?\nAnd then once you get to Orange Sky, then they really start helping you. That there are so many opportunities because [00:10:00] people know people and they have connections and I've literally seen members of Rowan Sky help saying to people, oh, I know it. I know a guy. I can help you do that.\nAnd then, Hey, I heard you're moving to new apartment. I'll go with you. Would you like me to go with you? And it's, it is nothing. It's really, it's really a there's nothing inappropriate about it. You can, you can trust these people and they're accountable. But also what it means is that if there's more than one orange sky, and that's happening all over Australia people start to get to, to get the idea that charity is important and that helping people is important.\nAnd I think my grandfather my grandfather was Catholic and my grandmother, they were both like that. They, you've gotta, if you wanna do something, you've gotta do it yourself. And you've gotta, you, you can't just, you can't just ignore people. You have to help people.\nIf someone's struggling, you help them. If you see someone by the side of the road, you don't necessarily have to give them money. But you can say, [00:11:00] Hey, do you know that, there's four places where you can get meals this week. Here's a pamphlet. And at least it'll make them feel as if they're not at the end of the line. And when I say the end of the line, it's beyond that point where they're attention seeking and it goes to the point where they just start perhaps, I don't know. They get, they just, they perhaps get suicidal, which is just horrific. But you don't want people to do that.\nYou don't want to live in a society where people will just let people. Die because just because they're out of luck this week. So that's, yeah, that's that's where I, that's where orange sky, that's what orange sky means to me. It's, yeah. It's been really good. Yeah, mate, it's so amazing.\n",

You can put it around like your sternum kind of, or like, so hide it all the way down so you don't get it. Right there? Yeah. Yeah? Alright, just make sure that, that I've got it 50-50. Great. I've cut my hand. That's helpful. Cool. And just say your name and spell it. Spell the whole name? Yeah. Tracey McCartney, TRS. Yeah. And then your A-C-E-Y, M, small C, big C, A-R-T-N-E-Y. And yeah, you took for me, it's like a yarn. Good. Pretty close. Cool. Tell us about yourself, I suppose, first. Like, maybe how long you've been here, like, a little bit about like, yeah, how, what got you here, that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've been in Kalgoorlie for a long time and I was the secretary at the Church of Christ for about 20 years. And when we moved location, we moved to Kalgoorlie. To the new location at Lane Street, we had some people coming in asking for a cup of tea and so I made them a cup of tea. And then that, there was a shower in the toilet area that they went to the toilet. They took a shower. So they had a shower. Then I thought I'll get some fresh clothes. I'll get a towel. And so things just kind of snowballed to what we've got today. Yeah. Awesome. It was amazing, Ms. Graham, as well. Thank you. Oh, thanks. So what's, I suppose, what happened this morning and like what's the vibe and experience like for people that haven't been? So we, it's interesting hearing from the perspective of somebody coming in because for us it's just our daily, you know, we kind of don't appreciate in a sense what we have here. That is quite special. But, yeah, people know that we open at 8 o'clock. People are waiting outside. They usually wake up from sleeping. Most of them are homeless. So they will wake up at daybreak from where they've been sleeping on the street and be ready to come here for a shower and breakfast. And like today we had lunch. She's every Tuesday. Normally on a Tuesday the Centrelink lady comes as well for them to see. We have free haircuts once a month. So there's different services here. But I think a big part of it is it's a safe space. It's a safe place where people feel comfortable to come and sit and relax and, yes, get the services available, but just to be in this space and know that it's their, you know, yeah, their space. So cool. What's the idea of collaboration you think in terms of what's happening here at OCAP? Is that support? Oh, huge. Huge. And it's been my desire to see, you know, to see you don't want to go it alone. You know, we can do so much when we work together. So we've got, you know, we've got the shower trucks and we've got Orange Sky, the washing, just coming together to provide such a service for the people. You know, it's, yeah, makes sense to me to work together. And like I came here and, you know, it was just on the whole time, like it's laundry everywhere, people everywhere. Yeah. Can you explain what that's like for people, I guess, like in the city sometimes we have shifts or that. Do you think that's what it is? Like what's that feel like for you in terms of the busy and important things? Oh, it just, you just recognise when I hear the statistics that come back from Phillip from the washing and the amount of showers that we do as well, because you're kind of just busy on the ground with people coming and going and that. And you don't really appreciate the actual numbers. But when you sit back and look at those, particularly when you, because we've got to keep stats, of course, you know, when you look at it over a six month period, how many loads of washing done, how many, you know, it's quite phenomenal. But it's sad in one sense that that service is so needed. But on the other hand, that's, you know, it's a lot of work. But on the other hand, that service can be provided is awesome because, you know, you think back to prior to that. And there wasn't anywhere that people could just, you know, if you go to laundromat, of course, it's going to cost a bit of money. And it's also getting there with your stuff. Whereas here they can come, have a shower, just do that single load of washing of the clothes that they had on ready for the next day. So, it's that cycle of things. Yeah. Yeah. A lot different to the household laundry that you normally do. You know, you've just got to put yourself in the shoes of people who are living differently like that. Yeah. And sometimes it's really hard to personalise what's happening, especially from an individual. And sometimes it's even hard to get a photo taken. Yeah. Can you tell us about the lady that was given the privilege not to come and get a photo? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, she lives in… And what's her name? Her name's Cecily. Yeah. Lovely Cecily that… And that's, you know, I don't term this as my work. This is, you know, the place I come to meet with my friends. You know, that's what it's for me about building relationships with people. And, yeah, Cecily's been coming pretty much since we began. And she lives out in the lands. And she's a very, very good friend. And she's a very, very good friend. And I think that's what's so amazing about her. Yeah. And I think that's what's so amazing about her. Yeah. And I think that's what's so amazing about her. And I think that's what's so amazing about her. But a lot of the people that come through M25 here are people that come in from communities. They come in for different sorts of reasons and then they end up staying sometimes for longer periods or shorter, depends on what the situation is. So, Cecily's been here for a while. So, her and her partner and her sister-in-law, they will come in every day. yeah and she loves to be able to get the washing done here or she's staying out at Ningamiah so the washing truck also goes to Ningamiah and she'll access it there as well so yeah she's um she's a regular and if she would have spoken she would have told you how much she appreciates the service for sure yeah yeah she's great yeah what you doing? and the kids I guess yeah so there's kids here they seem to love hanging out here they seem to like have a really strong affinity with yourself and stuff and we got to make sure that you're a bit closer to the young kids and tell them a little bit about their experience and yeah who they are uh some of them we've known like since our babies since they you know since they come along so it for me it's like you know a bit more than it's like I was saying before it's not like work it's a bit more like family um yeah so the kids are just they just love being able to come and feel comfortable to hang out in this space and to have their shower to get their washing done have fresh clothes on I love to have their nice fresh clothes put back you know and dress up and everything they yeah yeah they love the services that they can access here and yeah it's a joy to have them around and to you know yeah it does it just adds it just all about family that's what we are here kids and all and the like if the kids haven't gone playing basketball or like come back around to the camera and stuff he said that are they um are they um brothers and sisters did you say oh they're cousins yeah but they um are they um brothers and sisters did you say oh they're cousins yeah but they um what happened oh oh yeah I see okay thanks Niall you all right thank you Niall give it a clean up um for um not for the camera but for you Niall um an accident about a year and a half ago and his mum and his nana passed away in the accident and he had quite bad spine injuries and things like that. So I was friends with his grandma for a long time that she passed and his mum and so now he stays with the little girls family in town but yeah and then we've got him into the boarding school in Coolgardie so he can go there and that's why he's keen to get back to community for the holiday family and that but he's had yeah quite traumatic. How could you explain that on camera? Yeah how could you explain the situation maybe for some young people in the community who get the access with police services? Yeah because you don't want to kind of be sharing their you know Yeah maybe just kids in general like what are some of the challenges I guess? Yeah well they you know we have some kids that will come in and and have their um get their clean clothes and have their shower and get ready before and have breakfast before they get off to school so then they feel good to go into the school environment which is which is nice to be able to to work with that as well which is really cool um you know and some of the kids are sleeping rough with the family you know on the on the streets and that which which does happen and to yeah for them to be able to come in and access the services we've got here and for this to be a bit like a home point for them you know with the toys and the things that we have and yeah playing some sports and we also have um kite school which they come on a Monday and Tuesday and they come in and play on Tuesday and they'll set up their little kites as kids kids in town enrolled in school um so they are Nana Jarrah-Lans from that and yeah they all used to be here so these kids could sit at do some school activities and continue schooling if they're in town even though yeah being away from school and community which is a which is a plus and it just adds to that whole you know yeah and what's your what's your concept of I guess clean clothes and the kind of guy thing like what what do you think was the first yeah yeah oh just I was just blown away because when I read up about it and you know the people that started it and just see how young they were and and having and and be having that kind of thought you know like from such being so young but thinking like that was just yeah I was quite impressed but it's just um yeah such a yeah such a jaw dropped all those years and and just showed me how both uh people like hanging around almost I mean I had no idea what it's like what you do you have to wash your clothes right like you have to have a shop people start wondering how much facial you can do and and um they talked about it a lot and you know you're you had seen medicines your términus with your hundreds of them taking your many many rounds of transfusion treatments and you know it's it's totally extra coverage generally said you know it's good to be clean but at the same time I learned the bits so I'm really excited that I was back on the day when I got shot a couple of weeks before coming out here because of this digital transition and doing individual research I just was feeling really good about it I've. for washing their blankets so then they've got clean fresh blankets to sleep in which is the whole circle for them with clean clothes clean blankets it's um helping health wise and everything sores and stuff like that you know it's the whole um yeah it's the circle that it's helping with here which is huge plus I've had feedback you know people have um doctors at the hospital and nurses have said you know since these services have been introduced that they see people coming in getting treated are are cleaner to you know and that's not just from a point of view it's from a point of view how good it is for that for the person you know to be able to have that service yeah yeah yeah um yeah friends I like that it's so much more personal and that's what I you know then then like them or the people or yeah that kind of thing yeah kind of creates distance and that but yeah for me it's yeah yeah it's got to be that um connection I feel yeah and I feel that's important and you know um yeah I'm here for you yeah I'm not looking down on you because you need a washing truck I'm not you know looking down on you because you you're you have to live the way you're living um it's like phenomenal um oh folks group right um um please help me to um now so um guys during yourrations um you have that place to provide that service for the young um just to keep everything safe ah um yeah I mean my um um my um um um because of where we're placed, Kalgoorlie, in being on the edge of the desert and all the lands, the communities, the Ngunnajarra lands and the, I'm probably saying these wrong, Ngunnajarra communities. So, yeah, we'd probably get a lot of different folk to say more in the urban environment, which we're very fortunate. It's great. We get to cross paths with a lot of people that some other towns or that wouldn't, and I count that as a real blessing that we get to engage with them and to learn from them. And, yeah, yeah, it's really, yeah, a lot of pluses. Cool. And last bit is, like, what's your sort of hope and dream for what this becomes? But also, I guess, outcomes for the community in general? What's going to happen for the next five to ten years? Oh, that's so huge looking ahead. I try and make it through day to day. And in all honesty, I didn't see that we'd be here, like, a couple of years ago. So it's sort of like, you know, just, yeah. So, I mean, we'd love to see a, and we know that Orange Sky have the pods, the permanent pods instead of the mobile channels. So, yeah, I think that's going to be a big plus. And I think that's going to be a big plus. Being able to have something like that on site would be amazing. And moving forward with things like that, because we don't see that the need is going to lessen any. It's only going to grow. That's what we've seen. And so, yeah, looking ahead to having, upgrading, I could say, facilities and services. Yeah, yeah, it'd be a huge plus. Because we're wearing out. Oh, my God. Oh, and tell us a little bit about the fellow that's working with them. Oh, Philip. Oh, he's amazing. Yeah. We've been really fortunate. The first, the person who started, Stuart, that started on the truck and then Philip, when he left, we're like, oh, no, because he's such a part of, like I say, the family here, you know. But then Philip came on board and he's just amazing. Just amazing. Yeah. Just the way he engages with the people that he's serving and the way he's doing it. And how, yeah, he's just, yeah, he's just part of the family. It's not like he's just over there on the washing truck. He's, you know, amongst it with us, with everything that's happening. Yeah, good. It's really good. Very good. Was there anything else from your perspective you wanted to capture or that's something for you that you wanted on the floor? No, no. I mean, it's just the value of the service. Yeah. Just the Orange Sky service. And it was wonderful, you know, when Judy and the others came out to visit us and it was great for them to actually see, you know, how the service is utilised and stuff. I don't think they've been since we've been in here, actually. So, come. Yeah, it's just so valuable. Yeah. It's so valuable. Very good. Great. Great work. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcript": "I don't handle bright light well. Are you okay? Yes, a bit better there. Your name? What's happening here? Your role? Name, role? How many years have you been at Diagrama? Very well. Well, my name is Amelia Beltrán Martínez. I'm looking at you. My name is Amelia Beltrán Martínez. I am a psychologist on the technical team of the Socio-Educational Residence La Villa. And I have been at this residence since we inaugurated it in 1998. Previously, I started as an educator at a center called La Zarza, which is in Abanilla, in Murcia. And I have been doing this for about 27 years. It's been a long time. What's the best thing about working here? The best thing about working here, well, since it has been so many years, and I can speak from my experience, when I started I was 23 years old. Now I am 50. So, I have been able to live this experience while I also grew and matured. Then, one of the best things that working here has brought me is to value my life. To value my life, to value my quality of life. It has helped me a lot to trivialize things that have happened to me personally. Because it's true that often in your private life you give importance to things that, when you live with much more complicated and harder life stories, you start to become aware of how there are priorities in life, that sometimes are given a lot of importance and then they really don't have that much. If we could do something very different in Australia, it's quite difficult for children, we see some bad outcomes. What would you say to people who are not implementing this now? What could you tell them? What would you say could be the future if it were implemented? Let me explain a bit about Australia. I don't know if you know how things work there. No. It's very different. No. It's more restrictive, it's more punitive. And all that entails. It means that they have no way out, even the family is not worked with, there is no therapy, the work is much lower, it's more about security, security, security. Yes, it's penalizing. Totally. So, what he is trying to do is change there and make a movement for change there for something similar. So, what would you tell them that they could achieve there having a work model like we have with the kids? Yes. And what is the change that they would like? What would you advise? I mean, that could be it. What would you advise and what would you choose from the model? And how do you think it would change having a model like this? Now, I think that above all the first thing to consider is what objectives you want to achieve with the intervention you are going to do. So, of course, if you socially or legally and politically just want to punish, then, what? Well, really a system that is exclusively punitive serves you. But, of course, it will only serve to make a legal penalty. But it will not serve to achieve any objective nor to make an improvement in what is the social life. Because really no matter how much you punish or how much you penalize, you will not eliminate crime. Nor will you eliminate that there are certain things. Why? Because if you are in a system of dysfunctional behaviors, to put it in a way, not only legal, criminal, but behaviors that are not socially desirable, you will not eliminate them exclusively because you punish. I mean, really those types of behaviors do not come from a present situation, from the current moment that a person commits a crime and that's it. No. There we are talking about a life story. And we are talking about that something can be done. And it's that this person has been developing within a context, within a social framework, within a political, family, economic framework. So, if you really want your action to provoke a future change, you cannot intervene exclusively by punishing. You have to intervene in all the factors that could have influenced that person currently functions as they do, but at all levels. At their emotional level, at their social level, at their future prospects. I mean, that person has not fallen from the sky and suddenly their life perspective is to steal or to harm. That person comes from a history that has been, it's like a puzzle. So, it has been creating them. If you want to put the whole puzzle together and you want to change it, you will have to work on all the pieces. Because otherwise, you will always be lacking. I mean, it's clear that, for example, this system does not guarantee that the work you do always has a positive effect. I believe it always has a positive effect. What it may not have is all the positive effect you would wish. Because it's true that many times you work in a world that has nothing to do with the world. Often you work a lot with a kid and you can't work as much with the family and even work a little less with the context they come from. But well, if you have worked a bit here, you have worked with the family and the work with the kid more or less works for you, then you have many more possibilities that that kid when he returns to his area will not get involved so much in criminal behaviors. Or even in many cases, that he can take some distance from his entire context, from where he comes from. I think she could have touched on that, but what is the broader social impact of a model like this? Can you talk a bit about that? A bit more. I can ask. What do you think is, from the model we are using, what do you think is the social impact it has? The social impact it has... Well, if you ask me, I think we still fall short. Of course, I think we still fall short. It should still have much more impact. Because, for example, us, I always ask here in Spain that politically and socially and at the level of social resources there should still be much more. Because there are times when we work with them on things here that we then struggle to generate. And generalize them to where they live. Because there should be many more social insertion resources, many more intervention programs with families. Because that would really make us the complete set. But yes, it's true that within everything, at least, working with them, at least in the perspective that we try to work here, the idea is that they leave here thinking that they can opt for another life. Because sometimes, unfortunately, you don't end up facilitating all the paths you would like. But yes, that they have in their head the possibility to choose opens up. That they are not completely determined to end up being like that. I mean, that there is some wider range. Less than we would like, but still there is some range. And if you want to say something important that we haven't said. Something that you would like to say, that you think is important that you haven't said? Well, I think the most important thing about working with kids, and more kids that come to you, from sometimes very complicated and sometimes very hard life stories, sometimes it's not so much trying to program the work by making it all mega basic, and unorganized, and you have to work on this and you have to work on that, which is also necessary. I think above all the first thing to work on is the people you are going to work with them. Because you have to learn a lot about how you are, and learn a lot about how you are going to be able to give back or work with these people. And for that, the first thing you have to be able to do is put yourself in their place. Be able to try to understand. Because they have done what they have done. It's never ever to justify what they have done, because that wouldn't help them either. But you do have to be able to understand what their path has been. Because that way you are going to be able to connect much better with them. Perfect. Very good. I'm going to give you a little hug. Yes? Boy.\n",

      "Transcript": "I think this sounds good. You're looking straight at me. Yep. Cole, this is awesome. Just do your name and spell it. It would be great. Okay. Elaine Everett. E-L-A-I-N-E. Everett. E-V-E-R-E-T-T. Awesome. Tell us a little bit about how you found out about Orange Square. I think I sort of had seen them on and off quite a few years ago. And then about four years ago, pre-COVID, I volunteered, but I was doing the Perth shifts. And then I moved over to the eastern states. And then we've come back and put my name down for the Perth shifts. But they needed someone down here. It's closer to where we live, so it's perfect. What stood out for you? Well, my family are big volunteers. And my auntie lived over here at the time. And she was volunteering with homeless people in the city and feeding. And she was feeding people with a shop front down near Bayswater. And I thought I'd like to do something like that. And I'd seen Orange Sky, and I thought this was a really good service. What stands out for you, I guess, from coming down to shift every day? What's the thing that makes it special? What makes it special is just connecting with people. And helping them feel like they're part of society. And feeling normal. I think it's really hard for people on the streets to feel like anybody cares about them. And providing this service makes them feel cared for. That's cool. So there's some visible homelessness, there's hidden homelessness, there's all different types. What do you see, I suppose, coming to shift? That's a really interesting point. So here we see regulars, occasionally you see people you don't know who've come from the city maybe. Or even people who aren't homeless but not doing anything. Not doing so well even if they've got somewhere to live. But outside of the shift, if you walk around these streets or even in Perth when I was there, you see people who don't access these services. So you know that way beyond what we provide, there are people there who don't access. Whether they don't know how to or they don't have the confidence to. And I think that's still really sad. There's a cohort of people out there who don't access our services. Like for instance, there's a gent behind us who hasn't come out of his tent all morning. And he's not coming back. Even though he knows we're here. And we don't know why. There might be some element of mental health there. We don't know. But yeah, there's a cohort of people who don't come here. What do you feel like the sentiment in Perth in general of homelessness is? Is there support? Is there care? What's the general public perception? I don't know generally. I mean you can generalise. The people that I speak to are sympathetic. You know, who know that there are issues there. I don't know why people are on the street. People don't choose to be on the street. I mean some people do. But it's still not a great place to be. And I'm sure there's an element of people who think it's not their fault. And they can't do anything about it. Or choose not to do anything about it. Or like to blame the people. But I don't know what the sentiment is. I just know what it is amongst my friends and the people we associate with. There was recently a podcast. Yeah, yeah. It was a topic of friends. What's that word mean to you in relation to Orange Sky? Friends? Yeah. So friends to me in Orange Sky are the people I work with. They're the people who access our services. The other services that we work with as well. Like the people who provide food here. They're all friends. And I guess so that we don't make people feel like they're different. Everyone's the same when you come here. On the topic of friends. On the topic of friendship. I listened to something recently. It was talking about like health outcomes and mental health outcomes and the importance of friendship. Yes. Yes. How do you see friendship in your life? Support you and your mental health, your life in general? Yeah, yeah. Good point. I mean mental health is one of the biggest issues for homelessness. And for me personally. I know that having a... Not a large number. Not a large group of friends. But good connection with people is really important for mental health. And it can be very grounding. And I think when you come here you can see that the homeless people in this community look after each other. And that's their friendship. And they come here and you build connections with people. So you know people that come here. And you remember their names. And you say hello. And they appreciate that you remember them. And you can have conversations. And remember things about them. You know that are important to them. What keeps you coming back to Orange Sky and liking on that thing? What would you sort of suggest if people are considering volunteering but don't want to take the lead? Well first of all I'd like to say that more the merrier. So you know it is a commitment. And it's not an onerous commitment. You know half a day out of your week is nothing. And it's not a big deal. It's just a way to help people. But the friendships really like I really enjoy coming here. My husband we volunteer together. And it's something we really enjoy. And we I love the conversations we have with people. Some of them are quirky. And that's quite enjoyable. And we have a bit of a joke with some of them. And you build those relationships where you can have a bit of fun. Yeah I guess if you want to volunteer and you enjoy connecting with people. That's certainly the volunteering organisation you want to work with. Because it's really organised as well. So everything is pretty slick. Cool. Nice little grab there on the slickness. We'll use that. Yeah. We like being slick. Alright I reckon unless there's something else you wanted to cover that wasn't covered then. No you've done well. Good job Ben. Oh thank you. That's another good one.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n\n",

      "Transcript": "So your name and spell it is first? My name and how to spell it? My name is Kelly Benjamin that's K-E-L-L-Y-B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N. Benjamin's a rad name. It is a good surname. I've actually just got married and my married surname is Kotevski but I'm finding it difficult to let go of Benjamin. What's Kotevski? Kotevski, yeah my husband's Macedonian. Macedonian, awesome. So they normally end in a ski. I love Macedonian. Yeah, good food. Yeah, that was so good. Well tell me a little bit about yourself first. Do you live around here? I actually do, I live up in Subiaco so about 10 minutes away from the shift at Moore Street. I've been with Orange Sky since covid so 2019-2020. I actually saw the boys do a presentation at my last job at Flight Centre. They came to one of our conferences and spoke about the Orange Sky journey. That was probably in 2018 and their message kind of stuck with me. I thought it was a great thing that they were doing like two young blokes, yeah just out of high school seeing a need in the community and I thought that was really nice. But at the time there were, I think there was only one shift in Perth at South Perth and just with working hours I couldn't make it. And then during covid I was looking for something to do to, I thought it was you know the world slowed down, now I've slowed down. It'll be nice to kind of give back to the community. I feel pretty blessed in my life. I moved over to Australia with my parents when I was 17 from South Africa. Not a privileged life in South Africa where we came from so coming here and you know experiencing a very first world country where you have everything. I thought it's yeah I want to do to give back. So reconnected with Orange Sky and at that time they were doing more shifts. So I was living down south of the river so I joined up to the Mandurah shift, decided there. And then when I moved in closer to the city I started up Moore Street and I've been here doing the Sunday shift every fortnight for yeah four years or so now. Yeah. Far out. And I was just down with AJ, he's dobbed you in. Well. What do you think about AJ in terms of like his journey and being able to be on shift with him? What's that like for you? Oh he's such a beautiful soul and quite like it's inspiring to see someone who's had so much adversity and he comes and he's smiling every day, making jokes and he's so passionate about helping others and you know just being a light. Like I don't think he even tries. He just yeah, he just comes and he's just a light. He's a light. He's a light. He's a light. He's a light. He's a light. I think of the people he comes and he just yeah brings everyone together like us volunteers and the friends everyone knows him. Everyone loves him so yeah his journey and his life is really inspiring yeah. That's cool. There's been a podcast recently for the F Word or Inspired Creators. Yeah I haven't watched it. I haven't listened to it yet. I've been waiting for a big drive because that's normally when I listen to a podcast. Okay. I think it was the first episode um how they said. More stories. their start how they started yeah so I actually want to get my husband that's why I've been waiting for a big drive because I want him to listen to it I leave him every Sunday and come here for half the day um and he's never you know been to shift or he doesn't really know the story so I'm keen to kind of share that with him it's great that they started the podcast yeah and it's like friends right what's what's your perception of friends that terminology both within Orange Sky but also like within your own personal life what does friendship mean to you um just being there for people like I guess I'm the kind of person that and my close Circle who I call my my close friends will I think attest to that um you know I'm the kind of person that if if someone's in need I just feel it in me to provide help and I think that's what friendship is like helping helping others um and being there for people that are in need and I think that's what friendship is being there for others they don't have you don't have to know them or but you know you can see when someone's in need and just having that empathy um yeah and and helping where you can that's cool um and this whole idea of volunteering what do you think the power of volunteering is not just for all the people you support for the general like world I guess say that again if volunteering like what why do you think it's a powerful um like tool or impact not just for people who are volunteering but also it um it tells the unseen that they are seen I think um I've seen our friends are in the city um like I was walking I was walking after dinner one Saturday night like all dressed up and I saw one of our friends um I won't say his name but he was getting tea and coffee at like 9 p.m on a Saturday night from another outreach provider and I saw him and I was like oh my God so and so um and it was just so and I was with my mates who didn't know him didn't know why the hell I was talking to this guy um in the middle of the city um who's completely different he's much older than me um and yeah you just get that connection and and then they know that they're seen because I I don't think they are and if someone's like on the fence and they're like I'm not sure about volunteering for a number of reasons what's what's your sort of how would you say how would you explain what the volunteering is like in our sky and why should they volunteer or give it a crack if someone's unsure about it um I would ask them their why like why did you why are you thinking about it like what what made it interesting to you and then you'll generally find out their reasoning behind it and then just like that's enough to say give it a go it'll be um I want to give back or um you know I feel blessed or this is how a lot of people this has happened to me um and you know I've come so far from that so People's why is pretty powerful and when they connect to that, I think that's kind of where it starts. So yeah, just connecting back to the why and having a conversation about it and what we do and the impacts. That's rad. Anything else you've always wanted to say about Orange Sky? Not really anything completely out of this world, but I love it. I love the team. I've been working with these guys, the same people for years. So it's like a family and it's great. It brings us together and it's really nice that we are able to give back to our community. So yeah, thank you to Orange Sky for that. Good grab. You're fucking so good at this.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Greg Cooke\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAll right. It's rat testing. Testing 1, 2, 3. Can you hear me? Yeah, we're on. I can see you. Check one, check one, check one. See you moving up. Oh, wait. No. Screwed it up. I knew something was wrong.\n\nNo, again. Okay. That's better all. So just your full name and spell it out for me to start off. Full name? Yep. Greg Cook. C-G-R-E-G-C-O-O-K-E. Oh, see, I would've got it wrong. Mm yeah, that's right. Yeah. Alright, Greg, tell us a little bit about yourself first. What's a little bit about yourself that you find is exciting or the most easiest thing to say about yourself?\n\nExciting. Uh oh well. I'm retired, uh, retired probably about, ooh, 11 years ago and started drawing sky probably about near enough to 10 years ago. [00:01:00] Um, yeah. Uh, you are talking about the weather here. I don't enjoy the winters here. Yeah, so usually go away. Um, and uh, this year I've just come back from South Australia, did all the peninsulas, uh, which was pretty nice, but very, very dry.\n\nAnd I'll probably be here for another oh month or so, and then I'll probably try and head north, um, up north New South Wales, Queensland. Get out of the weather. Hmm. Awesome. Yeah. How, when, when was the first time you heard about Orange Sky? Uh,\n\nuh, it was. On tv. It was bizarre. You know, I, I was just sort of switched it on and, um, I think, uh, uh, Nick and Lucas were on there and they were talking about Orange Sky, and I said, oh, that sounds pretty good. And then they [00:02:00] said it was, um, they were recruiting in Hobart. So I went to a session here and I think I was, you know, I was one of the first, um, on one of the first shifts.\n\nUh, so went there was where, you know, Robin was there and a few others. And, um, so yeah, I thought it's pretty good, pretty good sort of setup. So that's why I decided to come here. Mm, that's job. Um, all these years later, you still pumped about it, your crew and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Love it, love it. Um, yeah, the crew that we are with, we, you know, is just awesome.\n\nWe just really get on just super well and we probably have, you know, fairly disparate sort of, you know, uh, bunch of people. But yeah, we've got something in common, I suppose. Um, we've both got the same sense of humor, same sort of commitment, I suppose. We, we love it here. Um, yeah, he gets to know the [00:03:00] characters, uh.\n\nAnd it's an ever changing landscape here. You've got a lot of people who leave who you know who've left and you know, some have left and come back. Yeah, no, it's good. Tell us about, do you know us about this place and what it does and its history and stuff, or? Uh, not a great deal. I know that it was a sort of a, um, uh, well, Rus knows a fair bit more about it than me, but, uh, it's, uh, had various guises, you know, it was a mansion for a while, and then I think, uh, there was a mother and babies um, uh, place, which was over in the gray building over there.\n\nUm, but yeah, I dunno th the full history of it, but yeah, I think it's gone through a few changes and likely to go through a few more in the future. So don't really know the, the future of it here for us. Uh, but I suppose we'll just hang in there for as long as it takes [00:04:00] really. Mm-hmm. That's tough. Um, what do you think the, like, overall impact of this orange sky thing is?\n\nLike in terms of all of the things it does on different, like ways in which people interact with the van from volunteering to friends, doing washing to conversation, is there something that stands out for you as more important than others or, uh, yeah. Well, I, I think it's a conversation. Look, we, we have people who come here and just sit down and have a chat without doing any washing.\n\nSo I think that's a, you know, a bit of a mark of how important it's to some people. Um. But I suppose it's a bit diff bit of a different shift to others, uh, in that we're people's residents really. Uh, whereas a lot of other people actually have to travel to come to the van. Whereas here, um, they come often, they drop the washing off and then go back to their room and then come back to pick it up.\n\n[00:05:00] Um, but I think we are important to a lot of people, eh. Hmm, Hmm. Um, how have you seen it sort of shift and change over the amount of years you've been volunteering from, like, what it's like in Hobart to nationally? Do you feel that stuff as a volunteer, I guess? Um, well, I'm not sure. I dunno much about the national scene.\n\nI, apart from the newsletters I get. Um, but, uh, yeah, I, I suppose it follows a similar, similar sort of path. Um, yeah, I don't know. Don't really know. It's, it's interesting, like, yeah, so I think some people would like want to know and be fascinated. Some people are keen just to like do their thing, right, like on shift and yeah, I was talking with Robin and I think she's a bit more connected with like what's happening in headquarters and understanding what that sort of vibe is, whereas other people are just.\n\nPumps to do [00:06:00] their thing. Yeah. Well I think that's, that's, that's probably right. Um, I suppose Robin of necessity needs to know what's happening nationally. But yeah, I just turn up every Monday, have a few chats, you know, do a bit of washing. Yeah. Really enjoy it. What's your fascination with like traveling around and doing stuff?\n\nLike does that come from somewhere or is that just. Something that you are connected to or traveling around? What? Just yourself. Like what's, yeah, what's the fascination with like, leaving over all the time and traveling around? Uh, I, no, I've always done it. Um, like I've been back here for, well, uh, 25 to 30 years, but I've, you know, proof's lived in the Northern Territory and I've lived in Adelaide and Perth and yeah, I, I dunno, I just like traveling.\n\nUh, so, you know. Traveled in various ways, like did fairly long motorcycle journeys, um, and uh, and then got into [00:07:00] caravans. Now I've sort of got VV dub combi and we, we travel in that. Yeah. See Steve very mate. Yeah. No, I just, just, just love going different places really. And, and as well as getting outta the cold.\n\nYeah. Just have you got, um. Some favorite places that you've been? Um, yeah, probably Northern New South Wales. Um, and I suppose Cairns, because I know people up there, so we got up there fairly regularly. Uh, yeah. Um, we, well, the last trip we, when we went to South Australia, we were gonna continue on to, to wa but, um, we got to Australia and just spent too long there to actually get, get over and back in the, in the warmer weather.\n\nUm, because, you know, we want to get outta the south. As you know, me and my partner want to get outta the south, as you know, before it gets too cold. Mm-hmm. That's cool. [00:08:00] Um, anything else we didn't touch on that you reckon is important or about yourself or in sky? Uh, no, I don't think so. Nailed it. Yeah, pretty much.\n\nSo, yeah, just, yeah. Enjoy coming here every Monday with the crew. Um, yeah, that's about it. Awesome. Okay. Take a picture.\n\n",

      "Summary": "Chloe, an Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Support Worker, discusses the challenges faced by homeless individuals in Boulder Camp and Ningalmy, including harsh sleeping conditions and health risks. She emphasizes the importance of providing better sleeping arrangements and hygiene solutions to improve their well-being and suggests practical improvements like durable carry bags for mobility.",

      "Transcript": "Alright, just tell me your name and what do you do for your work and stuff? My name's Chloe and I'm the Aboriginal Homeless Fringe Rela Support Worker here. So I go out to Boulder Camp and Ningamai every day, supporting them with breakfast. Breakfast, cold water, hot cups of tea, coffee. If they have any problems, anything of need, I help them with that, assist them. I think it would be awesome if you do context of Ningalmy and Boulder Camp. It's an interesting one to be able to describe. How would you describe those communities, I guess? Interesting. Interesting. It can be challenging at times, but once you connect with them, they're actually lovely people and just like everyone else. There is a bit of things that go on out there with the drinking side of things. But then there's the issue behind that too. So they drink because they're homeless for one. It's hard to... Tell us a bit about, we've seen it and hung around and stuff. What's the sleeping conditions like for you? Rough, it's rough, sad. I leave from work every day going home worrying about them, especially with the weather changing all the time. So when it's raining it gets quite muddy out there, cold, muddy. I've put up with a few of my clients going to hospital with pneumonia from sleeping on the ground because it's too cold. And then in the summer I've put up with them telling me constantly like, we're scared to sleep here, we're scared to sleep there because of snakes. So they put up a lot with snakes, little bugs like that. But then we've had issues where people have went out there burning their blankets because they're intoxicated or burning their blankets, mattresses, things like that as well. Yeah, we've had that issue. Yeah, we just made his little bed here. What's your first impression of what this thing is? I think at first when you told me about it, I'm just like, yeah like yeah no I don't think that's possible but now that you've just showed us and helped us put it together it's amazing. It is a good idea. One it's getting them off the cold ground, well yeah it's getting them off the cold ground less chances of probably pneumonia or any other sickness. Also in the summer it's getting them off the ground for snakes, bugs, whatever bugs. They can pack it up easily and cart it with them but then the clean side of things, keep it clean, hygiene, yeah. Yeah, is there anything that you could talk a little bit about, things that you might change or ideas about things that could improve it? Do you have any of those points? A carry bag will be good, because a lot of them are homeless and going from place to place, town to town, house to house. So a really good strong carry bag that's going to last a while would be good. And you know how he mentioned with the straps to cut on the back, that's a good idea too. But yeah, I'm sure. That's cool. Yeah. But yeah, I'm sure. That's cool. Yeah. We went at Dingamai this morning. There was three lovely old ladies and they were in a tent and there were six of them in there with various types of bedding. What did you think of the long-term health and wellbeing outcomes? Can you say that again? What do you think of the long term health and wellbeing outcomes we can get? I reckon it would, if we had these everywhere, out in Inghamah or Boulder Camp, like them two places, I reckon it might improve the health side of things. Like I said, they're sleeping on a cold ground and that's straight away pneumonia in hospital. Some of them are elders, so I've had a few sent down to Perth because of it, because they're old and the coldness is affecting them, that it could kill them. So this must prevent that because they're off the ground and not, yeah. Can they fit in, quick question, can they fit in a tent? Yeah, there was one in the tent last night. Oh, so there was one in the tent last night. There's a caravan and there was a tent there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in that tent there, there was one. There was three ladies sleeping on it last night. Yeah, right, yeah. What about like mattresses in terms of bacteria and that sort of stuff? Do you think that's an issue? Yeah, I think that is an issue because you tend to have so many of them sleeping on this one mattress over a period of time. So someone will come from one of the communities in the land and maybe use that mattress, but then they'll go back home to the land, the mattress stays there, and then someone else will come and then they'll use it. So there'll be a number of people using the same mattress over and over and over now these mattresses don't get treated they don't get cleaned so that's another thing like the bed bugs and whatever else lives in a mattress yeah and is there any things that we should be doing do you think in terms of how we're engaging with community or partners or is there any recommendations from from like working at Vega for some time like learning we should be doing to help people feel engaged with the project? Well you already are doing it, you're reaching out and that's the number one start like the start of it is to reach out and connect with them and see their feed getting their feedback. Everyone's got a voice and I think it's good that you went and got their feedback reached out and let them have their opinion on like how did you ask them how maybe they would like it taint everyone yeah yeah yeah so it was it was really great to be able to just do it with them yeah yeah and then let them sleep on it yeah and then nick's going to come back in a few weeks time and I think that's that long-term thinking and getting feedback. It might work for one night, but does it work for two weeks? Does it work for two years? It would be interesting to know how that works long-term. So right now, here and now, it's also an idea for the weather, also the hygiene side of things. but then you wouldn't really know I guess until it gets tried out long term to see if it's going to work or not. Yeah, it's just shocking sometimes in these communities how nothing survives, right? Like everything there is being denigrated or rusty or whatever. Yeah, yeah. It'll be interesting to see how we go. It will be interesting, yeah. Thank you so much. No worries, thank you. You did so great.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "JEAN BAPTISTE - Drop in the Ocean\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nBut, um,\n\nall right. I think we are good, all brother. I'm gonna go back a tiny bit, so all you have to do is tell me your name and spell it for me so we've got, we Great. Spell it the name? Yeah. My name is Doist. Uh, J-E-A-N-B-A-P-T-I-S-T-E. Cool. Yeah, it's just when I write the name and it, it's all as awkward making it up.\n\nSo, um, cool. Tell me a little bit about yourself and, um, yeah, what you've been doing for the last few years that relates to what we're doing here today. So it is right. Uh, well, I'm the head of operations Europe for a drop in the oceans. We are a Norwegian based, uh, organization. Um, we work permanently in, uh, in Greece.\n\nUh, I've been working for the organization for six years now, and, uh. Throughout many of the projects that we've had all across the refugee camps in Greece and Bo and the, and other places. Uh, we've set up a laundry service in the camp of uni. It's actually not the first time that we're doing [00:01:00] laundry service.\n\nWe've done it in a camps, but this one is like a big operations. So after the Moria fires, uh, in Lesbos, the camp moved to uni and there was rapidly a need to, um, to actually, uh, serve the population with, uh, basic laundry access. Uh, there's a lack of NFIs in the camp. Uh, there's no laundry, uh, stations whatsoever, and people needed like, uh, an outlet to actually be able to watch their clothes.\n\nWow. What drew you to this type of work? Like why do you reckon you landed in this type of, um, existence and work and life? Okay. Uh, well, I've always volunteered, so I mean, I've been moving around all my life. Like we always lived, uh, with my parents, like, uh, in different locations. So for me, like volunteering was like an outlet to actually be a part of the, of the place I was living at.\n\nAnd at the age of 16 I started to. Volunteer with a soup kitchen in Paris. Um, and one thing led to another, like throughout my studies I was, uh, I did a master's in finance, but then I was interested in public politics and, uh, humanitarian work. So I studied that and [00:02:00] did some internships here and there and, uh, uh, and then, uh, ended up in, uh, in a refugee camp, uh, working in a refugee camp with a Swedish organization in, uh.\n\nUh, in Uhuna and, uh, you know, like in Greece you always say like, you're gonna stay like for two or three months. And it's been, uh, in total I've, uh, lived eight years in Greece, uh, and really loved it. So yeah, I wouldn't see myself doing anything else. And I think like, uh, looking at, uh, the state of the world, like working in migration is extremely important to discuss about these things and advocate for the rights of individuals on the move.\n\nMm-hmm. Is there one thing you wish that people would understand most around that experience? Experience of being a refugee or in a refugee camp? I think like, it's quite a visceral reaction I think people have when they think about refugee camps. Like what would, what would you hope people would sort of, um, understand about it that they might not know and what's needed?\n\nI think it's the reasons why people are on the move. You know, like I think we're all based on the gen uni convention of 1951, whereby like it's [00:03:00] someone who is suffering from, uh, who is like, uh, uh, persecuted or speaking from war is, has to be the definition of why someone on the. It's not only about that, it's like what is, uh, what constitutes a life.\n\nYou know, it's access to education, access to food, access to basic, uh, uh, human rights. That is the reason why most of the individuals actually moving in the world. So understanding this is actually key in elementary for us to also understand how we can welcome these individuals are coming to our countries.\n\nSo it's not only about like them fleeing, it's also like how they're arriving here and what do they have access to? I think. Yeah. Uh, when we're looking at the state world, again, it's, we're always looking outside of, uh, Europe. I, I'm talking about it from a European perspective, but we tend to forget that when they arrive here, they have absolutely no rights.\n\nAnd this is something that we have to fight for. Yeah. So like, um, yeah, looking at the, the refugee camps in Europe, it, it is a massive issue of integration, massive. Issue of like how we welcoming individuals [00:04:00] and there's different, like, history has shown that there's like a lot of different ways to actually be able to welcome individuals in our countries.\n\nLike I think there's like, um, um, the great return of Greeks from Asia Minor, like from Turkey, there was a million people like in the beginning of the 20th century that came back to. Mainland of Greece. Mm. And back then they were not in camps. They were actually housed in accommodations in Athens and given like a stipend to actually create a business and so on.\n\nRight. And this managed their integration back into Greece like quite well. So we could look as well as history and understanding that. Like, uh, migration is a force and is also like a solution for all the challenges that we have right now in, uh, in Europe. That's amazing. And why, um, why have you landed on something like washing as an important, like across all the elements that you could support?\n\nWhy, why do you think you've landed on this idea of like washing and support? I think it's a matter of sustainability in the end. Uh, there's a lot of resources that are being put into Greece, like about buying an nfi, like clothing [00:05:00] items, hygiene items, and you know, like I think the ability to wash clothes or wash like basic items also ensures that we're not spending too much, uh, time and, uh, resources in buying new items all the time.\n\nSo it's very about sustainability in the end. Uh, I think it, it's interesting because I think like Wash landed on us more than we actually were looking to do, uh, washing. Um, but we, uh, we, it's a, it's a project that we suggested in the Campbell MA and I remember like the, the head of UNICEF at the time that was responsible for the wash sector, uh, in the cab mug.\n\nLike when we suggested inside to her, she said like, well, we're not running a hotel here and this strike chord a little bit like, what do you mean we're not running a hotel? Like, I mean. People are affected by scabies preventable skin diseases, like are affecting everyone in the camp. Of course, laundry is extremely important to have like basic hygienic standards.\n\nSo with with what she said, it actually motivated us even more to [00:06:00] actually like, make sure that people have access to that. Um, and then, yeah, like we developed quite an expertise in the camp of Mai to, to ensure like that the wash standards are upheld. Uh, and there's a lot of things that needs to be, uh, uh, improved within.\n\nThose sphere standards as we call them. Um, yeah. Um, there's a bunch of people here from all around the world just coming together to, to, to talk about this idea of alliance. What's in your mind? What, what are we doing here today? Or don't you know yet? Right. Uh, I think we're laying the basis of like, uh, talking about laundry access and basic NIC standards as a human right.\n\nI think that's how I see it. I think we're talking about all of our experiences today, uh, to make sure that we can build like a foundations that we can also advocate for, uh. Basic, uh, uh, access to, to laundry. Yeah. What do you think the outcome or the vision or the five year like future looks like if we start to, um, collaborate, share, and understand each other better?\n\nHow is that gonna look like? Yeah, [00:07:00] it's a, it's a big, uh, it's a daunting task to take, Aurora to take over, but I think the future looks. Like, uh, us building like some standards, uh, us building like a strong collaboration in between like all these, uh, four organizations. And yeah, I think it's building our own capacity in, uh, elaborating a little bit our narrative in how we're gonna also like reach out to, uh, public institutions, reach out to private foundations and talk about this.\n\nSo I think we're strengthening ourselves and strengthening it. It's always like, collaboration is a big word, but like, it's always like if we are staying like, uh, on our own, we, we just have like, just one channel of communications, but by being all together, we're a little bit stronger. Um, I spent a, a week or so in, in Spain and the youth detention center and the thing that struck me was.\n\nLike how if you can treat people like a human, that's the most important part. Um, how do we humanize the work that all of us do? I think in terms of like, not [00:08:00] just making this successful for outcomes, but humanizing this, the issues that we're sort of working with, like Yeah. How do we humanize? Um, I think it's just empowering the population that we're working with is the most important.\n\nWe're just, uh, an outlet, uh. We're just like a, a motor of, of, of, we're starting something, but then it's really like to, to give the resources and give the materials to the individuals who are directly affected. So it's the, the, the how to humanize is really the empowerment of the population that we're serving here.\n\nUh, last question. There's a lot of like large global movements that support a lot of this stuff around refugees or like, um, the climate stuff or national disasters that have a lot of resource and whatever. What role does. Like smaller organizations with a decentralized sort of viewpoint look like, like, is like how much, um, change can the, like smaller groups coming together make versus the big global powers at [00:09:00] play?\n\nIs that something you think about or, uh, yeah, it's very big question. Um, well, last one's always the biggest one because that you don't have to answer either. I mean, it's about civil society in India end, you know, like, uh, civil society is like, for me it's the most important thing is like how those humans gather with one another.\n\nAnd actually our Motor of Change, big corporation states they're, they, they have set up standards in which we are supposed to respect, but they change their standards all the time. So I don't put a lot of trust actually in. In governments or in big foundations because they might, again, we are seeing happening today as well.\n\nThey, they shift the, their own foundations. So civil society has the strongest power and the strongest uh, uh, ability to actually make a change. So yeah, I'm a big, uh, supporter in civil society overall, and like volunteers and individuals just gathering one another. Amazing. It's, it's the, it is the thing that I think.\n\n",

Peggy Pomolin. P-E-G-G-Y P-A-L-M-I-S-L-A-N-D. Cool, and you don't have to worry about this thing, you can just look at it. It's not there. Tell us a little bit about yourself thing, you can just look at it. It's not there. Tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe. You can start there. Well, I am one of the traditional owner of Pumalang, the Mumburra tribe. Yeah, I'm one of four sisters and five brothers and we've been on Palm Island most of our lives. Yeah since the day I was born you may as well say. Wow what's Palm Island mean to you? It means a lot. It means so much to us. It's our heritage, our cultural relationship with the island and all that. How did you get to be part of this program? Did you want to do it or did someone ask you? How did that work? They pushed me up. Come on, we want one. We want one old lady, no not old lady, elders, the women's side. Because we couldn't get my other sister Christine, she's a bit sick. So they asked me. That asked me, it was Alan, my nephew, he just threw a little guilty trip onto me and said, why don't you come, it's part of your heritage too. And I said, yes I will, one day, one day. But I did come along anyway and I joined up with Richard and Alan, brother Alan, very happy that I joined the rangers program. And I'm also there to help the girls and all that, you know, give them some confidence And tell them a bit of stories about my old ladies before they passed on So amazing What's um How how is how do we best tell this story of what we're doing today and especially like what's down there How do we best tell this story of what we're doing today and especially like what's down there? Like the real facility? Yeah, it's three sisters. Yeah, we all, we have a story of it. It's all about, um, there was a law over here in Brook that no one was supposed to touch a big water lily. You'd have to leave it like this. It held a lot of water. One day one girl went there and took a lily bud from there and the water spilled out. But there were three sisters out here hunting. There was no water here then, it was dry. But there were three sisters out here hunting in the water. There was no water here then, it was dry. And that's where the water came from, to make palm island. It was around Palm Island then. And they got caught in that water and they couldn't get out. They only had just a digging stick, you know. But it was too short so they got caught in the water and they drowned and then they stayed in the water and turned into stone. So this is a story for three ladies, our three sisters. Wow. How did you get to know that story yourself? What was the process for you to know? I forgot all about that until Alan had it on his phone, had the story. He said, and he said, oh, Dad, Wally, they did a booklet of our history, our story, our dream time. I said, I didn't even know that. And when I looked at it, it just dawned on me. And I said, now I remember. Now I remember when I was a little girl, that story. Yeah, some of them I remember looking through. I said, yes, I remember the story that I still remember too. That's only when I was a little girl. And when I was a teenager, I just was a rebel. I used to run around with my mates and all that. I was never worried about cultural anymore, or tradition and that, you know. But since I got back to the rangers, everything started to come back into place with me. How important do you think that is for you to be able to take that position and share this stuff? Like, what's the impact do you think that on the whole community and the younger generation? I think it would be beneficial to know where they come from, whose tribe they come from and also to respect my tribe. And some of them are related to us. Yeah. And so they know the story of Palm and they can relate it to other tribes around Australia who've been married to somebody outside of Palm Island, you know? Yeah. Awesome. I got to talk with a young girl who was born on Palm Island and just finished school and went on the Ranger program. Yeah. How does that feel to have some younger people who are interested in learning the story and sharing? It's very good. Yes. How do you think that that can happen more? Like what do we need to do to make sure that happens more often? Well, we can just ask around. There's some ladies that came up and approached me about the rangers. And I gave them all the info I can by mouth. Well, just don't talk about it. If you want to come in, come in and sort things out. Yeah. I would like to get some girls, you know, young ones like Paige and, you know, keep them out of trouble and keep them on the straight and narrow, you know, instead of alcohol and drugs and all that, you know? Yeah, instead of getting pregnant early, just to get money from the government. Just, we get them back into our community, our way of life. Yeah. What do you hope happens next? Have you got some dreams and some things you'd like to see happen on the island? Oh, not right now. We haven't come to that yet. Yeah, but I like to see a lot of young people, you know, just come back to our way of life. Going on to the wrong path of, like I said, alcohol and drugs. That's what I like to see. Yep. So important. Was there anything else you'd like to say? Anything else important that you think people need to know? No. That's good? Yeah, that's good. Amazing. I'm just going to take a quick photo. I'll take that microphone off. Oh yeah. It's got a magnet thing on it. That's... yeah! Let's see if this... oh this is good actually. That's great. How do you go on the boat? Do you like being on the boat rocking around?\",\n",

      "Transcript": "John - Flower Ceremony Reflection\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSpeaker 2: What did we do today? Talk me through what we did \n\nSpeaker 3: today. So we, this morning we went out got some flowers with the kids and then went to the graveyards at Moira. First off we went to Tarraboola and a few of the elders spoke to the kids about the practice that we were doing today and how it was done like it was a common thing that used to happen back in the old days. So they talked about that. And then we got the kids to make the little like little flower things to put on the graves. And then, yeah, after we done that, made those, we went up to the old Mora mission grave site. And all the kids, all the jarjums got to put their flowers and that down.\n\nAnd then just gave it a good clean up. Yeah. And then, yeah, come back in for lunch. It got a bit emotional up there, I noticed. With, a few of them old ones, Aunty Mary and Aunty Evie and that. But yeah, I think it's something that it's good to pass down. Considering it was a common practice that our old [00:01:00] people would do.\n\nGo to the graves, maintain them. And I think it's also important because it teaches the kids. Who their family are. Different, members of the family. Them, or the elders can say, oh, this was your, great auntie, or this is yeah, I think it's, yeah, important that we keep that traditional life.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it mean to have your young people there with you as well? \n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, to have my daughters there, yeah, it means a lot. I'm keen to I was showing them a few of auntie, Joanie Sunflower, like a few of her sisters and kids and that, it's great. And yeah, Keane Fulisavi when we go over to the other gravesite so that I can show my daughters a few more of, my nan and a few more of the family.\n\nYeah. And it, yeah, it means a lot. Yeah. \n\nSpeaker 2: It's some people might not connect justice is what we did today but how connected is, this idea of what you guys are leading the way in Australia in this JR funding. Why is it, a ceremony or a program like today so important [00:02:00] in justice?\n\nSpeaker 3: I think I think it's important for, like when we look at justice, we don't just look at the youth and adult jail systems. Or the the jails. We look at justice as a whole. So justice as a whole for our people is practice and culture is one of the main things. Also, we're looking at things like housing all these different things, health, all that.\n\nBut one of the main priorities too is putting emphasis on the kids, on the youth. And having things like today, it's building their spirit up. They're listening to the elders speak. They're, they're seeing their family. And it's it creates like an empowerment inside them.\n\nAnd I think that's very important. Because a lot of, a lot of the things that happened to our people in the past were caused a lot of trauma. And it caused a lot of hurt and a lot of sickness in our people. A lot of drugs, a lot of alcohol. [00:03:00] So I think having these things for kids to do in the holidays and having the elders on board with it it creates that, that bond.\n\nAnd then it helps the kids feel accountable and feel, they feel like they're more than just, Yeah, they get a higher sense of being, I believe, yeah.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Brontee Lawson\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nPost video talk two, right? Yes. Video's working good. It's pretty good, I think. Alright. You look at me, don't look at this. It's pretty chill. And all you gotta do first and foremost. Is your full name and spell it. My name's Bronte, which is B-R-O-N-T-E-E. And my last name's Lawson, L-A-W-S-O-N. Great. Let's start with a bit about yourself. Can't a bit about yourself.\n\nThat's actually my least favorite question because I never know what to say. I always ask how do you like to either identify, introduce, or tell a story? At the moment, work is the biggest part of my life. I spent a lot of time doing that and talking about that. Very passionate about that. So I finished my Masters of social work last year and I've got a double degree in psychology and criminology as well.\n\nSo I've been studying forever. So finally in that career building stage, I'm very passionate about what I [00:01:00] do. That's cool. I spent almost 10. What was that? Sorry. I spent always 10 years at university myself. Yeah, it just creeps up on you. Yeah. Tell us about the first time you ever heard about Orange Sky.\n\nI was living on the Gold Coast and one of my friends at the time, she'd recently connected with Orange Sky, and I think she was there. I think she's still doing it now actually. So this would've been back in 2021, and she would just come home and tell all these stories about all the people she got to speak with and.\n\nHow special it was, and I didn't really think too much of it until I moved back to Hobart and was looking for a volunteer opportunity. And this is the one that popped up. Why? Why keep turning up for you? Why do you get to come to those scholarships? The relationships, definitely the people that come along every week and.\n\nJust, I like to be someone that will say hello to everyone and you see it. A lot of people will walk by and they'll be very straight faced and then you'll say hi. Like, how are you? How have you been? [00:02:00] And you might not get much from 'em, but you'll usually get some kind of smile. Or the fact that someone's stopped and asked them usually seems to, be a good part of their day.\n\nIt was awesome sitting down with Sarah. Do you know her very well already? She used to come. A lot used to come every, because I come here every fortnight and I used to see her really frequently. And sometimes when she doesn't come along for a little while, I do worry a little bit, which is a hard part of the work I do and my volunteering.\n\n'cause if you don't see people, you're like, there's so many different things that could be going on. But I know that she's got, really switched on and pushed through a lot of really hard stuff. Do you know much about her experience in terms of the language she experiences? Circumstances and stuff or in terms of like her accommodation status?\n\nYeah. A little bit. Yeah. I try not to ask too much because I like that we can give a break from the hard stuff sometimes. 'cause they, we get to go home at five 30 and go back to our homes and our lives and people don't get to stop going through the hard stuff. I always think [00:03:00] about this thing of orange sky is, some people want it to be lots of things and some people want it to be just.\n\nA few things. What do you think in your mind is the impact now and how do you think they keep that same impact going? Do I need to do more things outside of what they do? What do you think? Way better for them to stick with what they're good at. I think it's probably stick with what they're good at.\n\nI think there's a lot of organizations out there, excuse me, and at the moment, everyone's really struggling to keep doing the work they're doing. And so if people aren't meeting a particular need or if everyone's trying to do different things and service different people, then they lose their, impact sometimes.\n\nSo they stop getting funding, they stop getting people coming along and I think it's really known to be really sorry, it's Sunday. Really good to be known for what you do and doing it well, so people know that they'll come to us and we'll be friendly and we'll, they'll get some clean clothes and a good chat.\n\nAnd I think there's a lot of dignity in that. I do wonder how, 'cause I know on the mainland they have, [00:04:00] like the showers. Yeah. Which I do wonder if, it could be worth expanding into that because, if someone could, I know they've already got showers here at Salvos and most of the places that, orange sky parks up.\n\nBut I think, having a shower could be the highlight of someone's week sometimes. Great. I'd love to hear a little bit more. Okay. You allowed to talk about your work? Yeah, I can talk about my work. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us a little bit of why you got into. And what sort of is your day to day type stuff?\n\nMy day to day, the way the day starts versus the way the day ends is very different. I do a lot of work in the prison and work cl closely with community corrections. For me, I do the outreach up in Launceston. I'm up there every fortnight working with people up there too. I think that intersection of justice and disability just does get enough attention, and particularly in Tasie, it's a really.\n\nPunitive state. So people think, oh, you screwed up, you broke the law, lock you up, throw away the key. And people who are involved in the justice system, they have so much to give. They've got a lot of [00:05:00] resilience, a lot of knowledge, a lot of skill. And when we lock people away, we lock those contributions away too.\n\nI am pretty close to justice, the justice stuff in Australia. Pretty fascinating what's happening in Tasmania moment. They yeah, there's been a slight interest in how do you remove the detention center and create some home style detention education. Do you know much about what's going on there or?\n\nYeah, a little bit. Youth Justice was initially where I wanted to go. I've done some casual work in youth homeless shelters and counseling, work with young people and. It is really hard. It's, yeah. 'cause it's not just the young people, it's, their lack of connection to family and community and their brain's developing and a world that's changing so quickly.\n\nSo it's not just, why is this person in front of us offending? It's who are they going home to at the end of the day? What opportunities do they have? [00:06:00] Yeah. Let's talk after the interview about. Someone listen back to this little stuff going on track, got an agenda. Tell us a little bit about that interception though.\n\nI think disabilities, corrections, homelessness. What is the connection between some of these things or disconnect? I. Well, somebody who has, a brain injury or some form of cognitive impairment, those fundamental skills of, impulse control, decision making, planning, understanding consequences, and future thinking is usually really impaired.\n\nSo if someone's already in a pretty hard set of life circumstances, they're already in that, survival mode. So their decision making is gonna be really opportunistic and how do I get out of this stress right here, right now? So it's really hard for them to. Think about what the impact of decision making is.\n\nTo figure out who safe people are to be with and who's gonna help them reach their goals. And they've also usually learned to mask their whole lives. They don't necessarily identify as [00:07:00] being someone with a disability, so won't, seek support for that. And there's a lot of vulnerability, particularly in a, a prison setting of saying, yeah, I've got a disability.\n\nYeah, I've got a brain injury. So they just keep trucking along and they find some really clever ways to do that. But then particularly when they get out into the community after being in prison, there's a lot more decision making and then there's a lot less structure. And when you're coming out onto the streets, trying to navigate all of the services that are out there to support people, like it's one thing to have.\n\nServices, having the skills to actually remember to go to appointments or remember what's being said in appointments or implement the strategies that are being talked about is a whole, another set of challenges, I think. Yeah. One second.\n\nThere's this concept of connection. I think that's what I suppose that and like a lot of people talk [00:08:00] about this theory of the opposite of Dion's connection. Do you think there's similar things with disability in terms of that idea of connection and how that supports someone?\n\nHolistically? I think I'm thinking about one person in particular that I work with and they. It became they had their brain injury around 20 and they're in their forties now and massive impact to their cognitive functioning and a lot of vulnerability. Vulnerability there. And people think, maybe he's just intentionally being forgetful or, some of those social skills can really be impaired with cognitive impairment too.\n\nSo knowing who safe people are, how much you can share with people, because it's really hard to break through that vulnerability that helps us connect with people around us. And what do you get out of being a volunteer or expert? What's the, do you feel like you're getting growth experience and stuff here as well as providing service?\n\nI think any chance that we get to [00:09:00] hear people's stories and, they've lived lives I could never, ever imagine. So just that reminder of, it's hard out there, but it's not focusing on all of the bad things that come with struggle, but on the things that people get to share and their knowledge.\n\nAnd I think that's a really big part of why I do my volunteering and my work as well. We call this keys to the city. Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you wanted to say or talk about?\n\nI don't think so. If you didn't get me at four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps I'd be a lot more articulate and forthcoming, but.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Good morning and welcome to this Orange Sky Laundry Help. Laundry Help, I came last week to meet them and they said they can wash. So I live in an entrance of my own. So I got a few bed sheets and pillow covers which I can't normally wash. It takes a lot of struggle to wash it. So they are giving me a chance to wash my big clothes. How did you find out about it? Very good, very helpful and friendly nature. And they are quite good accommodating. Thank you very much. How did you find out about Orange Sky? Actually somebody, I came to this Anglican store and they give some time nice fresh bread. So I told they said I can go here. They run out sometimes. So they said just go across the road to the neighborhood center and they give free lunch. Okay. And they give free lunch as well on Thursday. So I came on Friday and they gave me the opportunity to wash. So I bring today my clothes to wash Orange Sky. What's your last little bit of life been like? Where have you been staying? I've been staying in the entrance and it's near the Round Board Community Center. They used to come washing vehicle. I don't remember the washing machine. They stopped due to the long, their own problems. They used to come from Newcastle or somewhere. So they used to go to Picnic Point. And now they're thinking to start the community washing. So I come here to find out. So I'm trying to pursue them. I'm trying to pursue them to go to the entrance and have a quick wash like Batu Bay or Picnic Point or any other way. And how long have you been in Australia for? I came in 1989. Basically I'm an IT expert, steel making. So I had no problem. In fact, I got the job without interview. After seeing the bio data because I had a very long experience in IT and a steel automation expert. So basically I was in inventory control system. So I got job as a system analyst. And there was some organization technology change. So they carved out the BHP IT. So and then there was some gap. And the company went on things, changed. So again then I got job in South Australia LPD. This is called Long Product Division. No one steel. So one steel was taken over by Liberty. So I was there then come back here then worked with few new software government department. But as you know that IT has major changes because it was mainframe. Then come the other technologies. PC and networking. Now you got the broadband technology coming wide. Wi-Fi, you know. The things changed a lot. So then I did some problem and medical problem, health problem.

      "Transcript": "\"My name is Jesús Teruel, and I am the Coordinator of Territorial Directors of the Diagrama Foundation youth detention centres in Murcia, Spain.\nI am deeply committed to the belief that treating young people with respect, recognising their potential for growth, and providing them with the support they need to change is essential to help them break free from the cycle of repression and deprivation of liberty.\nOur centres are not just places of confinement; they are spaces for growth.\nAlthough these young people are interned due to a judge's order for committing a crime, we must work with them to address their actions, help them understand the consequences, and encourage empathy. Through this approach, we witness remarkable changes. Experience demonstrates that with the right support, young people can transform their lives, and our recidivism rates, as low as 20-25%, stand in stark contrast to what I've heard about Australia.\nThe majority of minors who undergo our judicial measures do not reoffend, and most who complete our reform program do not end up in jail. This is a testament to our unwavering commitment to change.\nI firmly believe that by intervening with adolescents and young people, we can effect change. People do not transform through divine intervention; they change when they are supported, their progress is reinforced, and their personal growth is valued. Many of these young people have lacked the structural support necessary for their development. If we fail to provide it, they risk falling deeper into a life of crime.\nAt Diagrama Foundation, we hold high expectations for every child's future and treat them with the respect they deserve, empowering them to build a better life for themselves.\"\n",

        "Another prevalent theme is the belief in the potential of these young people to grow, change, and break out of the cycle of delinquency. This belief drives the support and resources given to them in their personal development process.",
        "Successful interventions in the form of reform programs are highlighted. A low recidivism rate is mentioned as evidence of intervention efficacy, contrasting it with other systems (e.g., in Australia).",
        "The speaker stresses the importance of offering consistent, structured support to the young people in order to foster their development and change. Absence of this support is mentioned as a cause of their previous issues, indicating the vital role institutions play in societal change."

Yeah. And we use a lot of road gear. Yeah. Um, whether it's mics or Yeah. Yeah, interfaces or Some of the new kits, they just, um, I use those, um, GoPro ones, they're in like a little kit.\nThey're amazing. Yeah. Um, we did a whole podcast on them recently. Little, little kit. No, I just, um, microphones. Um, they record on um, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Extraordinary. But they've put, they've now got one that's built into a handheld mic. So it records on the mic. And so, I'm really keen to test it, because the issue with those little ones is like, people don't know where to put them or whatnot.\nWhereas this, you literally just like press record, and it's just fucking banging all day. I've got a, I've got a mic attachment. So it's this weird kind of interview mic, and you put [00:01:00] the unit in, it fits inside it. With a little, uh, a little windsock on it. But, to have it inside a mic. Yeah, just write up a list and I'll send it to you.\nOh, that'd be amazing, man. He's a super weird cat, but like, just super generous. Yeah, yeah. Amazing Australian story. Like, they made all of Sydney.\nYep, yep. And they're, like, they're industry standard. Um, DJI tend to be smashing them a bit at the moment. Uh, here at Red Dust we primarily run programs in remote communities across the Northern Territory. So we've got a basis here in the Top End in Darwin, and we've also got an office in Alice Springs.\nWhat would a typical program, uh, for us, a typical program is more about the process behind the [00:02:00] program, around, you know, talking with communities around what they want to see, what young people wanna see, um, how we can collaborate with other service providers in communities. So it's more about how we go about what we do rather than a cookie cut program that, um, that relates to every community.\nWhat's, um, in particular to run a programs around health. What are you sort of seeing, like why is a health program important? Well, we see these entrenched, um, uh, primary health issues in communities that, that people are trying to move. Things like rheumatic heart disease, things like scabies, trachoma. Um, there's, there's primary health issues that, um, that don't exist anywhere else in the world and are still entrenched in Indigenous communities.\nUm, clearly there are issues driving that, systemic issues. Um, so it's, it's one thing to be, um, you know, we've done a lot of, um, I guess working with communities to highlight [00:03:00] and service providers, um, clinics to highlight certain health issues. Um, but without, unless we can kind of start to advocate for and shift some of those systemic issues around housing, um, then it makes it very challenging.\nUh, the bedding environment typically, uh, is, well, we know, you know, with the overcrowding issues in housing, um, the bedding environment is often, um, pretty grim as far as what people are sleeping on, what people have access to. Um, we also know the transience within communities means that families are often staying with other families in communities where, um, you know, the bedding may not be.\navailable or sufficient for, for families. So people are just sleeping where they can. What do you think people in communities are looking for in a bed? Uh, I [00:04:00] think they're looking for something that's, um, that's easy to use, that's transportable, um, that's functional, um, and is hygienic If, uh, this first prototype, we may be thinking of going into the crate bit, what are your initial reactions?\nYou know, it's one of those things where you look at it and kind of go, why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Why hasn't anyone explored this before? You know, we also talked about, um, uh, giving ownership to communities and to families, um, which is really important. And it's an idea that people will take and, and take it in their own [00:05:00] direction.\nI think that's what excites me most about it. It's a really simple idea, um, to a really complex issue, um, that can be taken and, taken and modified for individual families, individual communities, um, yeah. How would you explain this, this, uh, mattress to one of your, one of your friends in the community? Um, I would say that it's a really simple, uh, flexible alternative to, uh, to what you might be using.\nUm, I'd be just encouraging, really, I think it's just about getting it out and trialling it. You're road testing it, um, and giving people ownership over what those issues are. You're never going to know until it, until it hits the road. But I think the idea is, is simple and adaptable enough to be able to road test and modify, um, as it goes along.[00:06:00]\nWhat, uh, acts as a project? Well, we know, um, we know some of those issues around like rheumatic heart disease. Come on. It just should not exist in, uh, in our country at all. It shouldn't exist anywhere. It's an entirely preventable disease, um, that still remains, um, entrenched in remote communities. Um, these are the sort of larger impacts that simple ideas like this can have, you know, a really effective ideas.\nUm, That, you know, if we just keep plowing away at the same old messaging, without challenging some of those underlying factors, and providing alternatives for people, we're not going to shift it.\nAnything else you want to say? Nah, it's cool. Can I have one? Yeah, you can have one. You can have the first one ever. Nah. Face it and everyone's safe. You ready? Yep. This is like the best lighting I've had all, like, trips, huh? [00:07:00] Um, if it's not actually a piece of junk, like, I'd love for you guys to play with it.\nYeah. Okay.\n",

So just, uh, uh, your name and spell it. Just the first bit. Spell it? Yeah. Okay. So my name's Jonathan, uh, JON. A THA Nki, X-E-N-A-K-I-S. Mad it. Yeah. Amazing. Uh, yeah. Tell us a little bit about, uh, Jonathan story in terms of like, um, even just where you're from and, uh, a little bit about like, um, how you got to this, this sort of Yeah.\n\nUh, this sort of title work. Yeah. Okay. Uh, I am from Crete, uh, in Greece. Um. So that's where I grew up. My mother's English, so I'm very lucky to, uh, to be half and half. Uh, grew up here in, uh, on Creek in Greece, uh, and then studied in the uk. Uh, and um. Which I did, uh, criminology and international relations.\n\nAnd [00:01:00] uh, then I think when I was studying it was a lot. Uh, this is when the refugee crisis really hit Europe. Uh, so that's when I kind of, uh, had a little reflection and I. Uh, introspect and kind of said to myself that, that's, uh, what I wanna do with my life. That's where I wanna, uh, that's where I want to help.\n\nSo, from that moment, uh, there was a, a few things that I had to do, uh, like military wise, uh, and uh, uh, in order to get myself. Available, uh, for the field. And once I was able to, I did, I started that out as a volunteer with the organization with a drop in the ocean initially here in Athens. Uh, and later on, Lesbos and I kind of, I.\n\nFell in love with the whole thing and kind of felt it as also a little bit addictive so I could, uh, I haven't left since really. Uh, and so I've, [00:02:00] uh, I worked as a logistics, uh, coordinator initially, uh, for a camp in northern Greece, and then as a field coordinator, uh, responsible for the entire operations of a couple of camps.\n\nThere for the organization itself. And then, uh, moved onto my current position, which is head of Programs, uh, for the, uh, uh, organization across Europe. Uh, and, um, I really, really, really enjoy the work. Uh, I really enjoy the opportunities to connect, uh, with other people like, um, like-minded people and organizations, uh, figure out common, uh, challenges and opportunities and uh, and try to.\n\nShape, uh, this field into, um, into wherever it can become in order to, uh, sustain these, uh, these, um, interventions and, and, and programs so that we can alleviate or kind of support, uh, maybe that's a better word, [00:03:00] uh, communities that. Need assistance for a specific time period. Is there like, um, seasons and, and changes that, um, happened in this field for yourself?\n\nAnd, um, where do you think your this is at the moment in terms of like, um. Public sentiment or even like the, how big the issue is. Yeah. What sort of season do you think that this is? I, I think there definitely is, especially in the public sentiment and especially towards, uh, civil society kind of, uh, organizations as well as, uh, goals and, and, and kind of missions in Europe and in Greece.\n\nUh, well, I, in Europe, in Greece specifically. NGOs, unfortunately, don't have an incredibly, uh, good kind of, um, public, uh, uh, sentiment, understanding and, and, and, uh, and support, uh, on a European basis that it's [00:04:00] slightly different. Um, so I do think things. Change, uh, season seasoning as well as, as you mentioned, is something that we do see, and I think we are coming to a moment in Greece specifically, if I, if I may speak about Greece, that it, it's public now.\n\nAcknowledge that civil society organizations need to play a big role now and in the, in the coming years, in the future. Um, so there is a effort to try and bridge, uh, and connect and maybe better the lack of trust that exists between, uh, communities and NGOs, community, uh, uh, uh, civil society organizations.\n\nSo I think right now, if, if I could use an analogy of, of of seasons, I would probably say we're at the end of winter and hoping there's a spring to come. But at the same time, there's external challenges. Exists, like, which are [00:05:00] existential for the sector. And this is more about a political spectrum and, and kind of where we are as a, as a, uh, a political community in the world right now, which can pose a lot of challenges to that, uh, spring.\n\nSo, um, yeah, but there's always ups and downs, but I, I think as I always like to say, ups and downs mean as a. If you go to a doctor and you go to a, a, you know, a heart doctor, a cardio, a cardiologist, uh, ups and downs means you're alive, flat, uh, which is usually what we all want to. We want stability. It usually means that the patient is no longer with us.\n\nSo I, ups and downs means that there's, there's things happening. So, uh, that, and I think that's also the. The give and take that happens within society, and I think that's quite valuable to acknowledge that that is happening. Mm. So many like random things happening around the world at the moment. Um, and there's been a few people come together today from.\n\nLike, uh, all the way from Zy [00:06:00] to UK to whatever. What's, what's the opportunity here to, to share and to learn from each other? Yeah. What do you, what do you think is gonna, um, yeah. Be talked about today and, and Yeah, the future? Well, I think this is one of those kind of efforts and, and ca uh, like I don't like using the word organic a lot.\n\nUh, 'cause it's quite kind of cliche now. Uh, but it, it, it does seem quite organic. Uh, what is happening, uh, which is a lot of people, uh, and a lot of, uh, uh, organizations, people work for or represent, are seeing common opportunities as well as challenges in the field of their operations, which has to do with wash and, and, and making laundry a a basic, uh, kind of, uh, uh, right, uh, for people.\n\nUm. To support the livelihoods and ensure dignity, uh, in, in those, uh, lives, whether these are in Australia, New Zealand, whether in the uk, [00:07:00] India, uh, across the continent of Africa, in in refugee camps, uh, here in Greece and elsewhere in the world. Uh, so I think what we are seeing is this. Grassroots and kind of organic movement becoming something, hopefully becoming something that can, uh, mobilize, uh, a, um, a community of doers and thinkers, uh, and ensuring that that.\n\nConversation does take place. And I think one of the interesting things that can happen from all of this, or one of the maybe more valuable things that we can take from this is that this conversation is happening outside of the confines of any kind of bigger, uh, institutional kind of directed discussion.\n\nAnd it's these grassroots movements that are bringing this discussion, hopefully bringing those discussions to them. So whether we're talking about. The international organization migration, whether we're talking about the United Nations, uh, system, or whether we're talking about the World Health Organization as well, sphere standards or [00:08:00] any other kind of, uh, big, big, uh, kind of, um, institutional partner.\n\nAnd it's, it's because, you know, these, these movements and these organizations are seeing. Uh, from their grassroots operations that this is a huge need and that we're trying to grab the attention, uh, of people that this should be, uh, something that we can more also strive for, uh, and secure for people.\n\nWhat does it look like when things start to change? Like broader than, um, things changing for the people we're trying to support, but like, what's it look like when society starts to shift? Like is there things that you have seen in the past where it's happened and like it's felt good? Mm. And and what, what would you like to see things shifting and what does that look like?\n\nI think this is, um, I think that's a little bit of a challenging, uh, question because I think societies don't shift that quickly. Uh, so anything that does take [00:09:00] place and anything, anything that we do today and tomorrow in the next, uh, few years, hopefully we're hope we're most likely not gonna be able to see results immediately, but it is about instilling this idea, uh, and these kind of, um, uh, seeds of ideas in people's, uh, minds and consciousnesses.\n\nUh, and hoping that that will come to fruition later on as well. Uh, I think, and maybe I can make this analogy that while I was growing up, I saw a lot of, uh, uh, movements and, and efforts that at the time didn't really gain any traction. But now, uh, whether this is, um, refugee related issues that I work with more directly or whether it's, um, for more like, um.\n\nDisadvantaged communities, uh, issues, access to education or access to, uh, basic needs, uh, such as we wanna do a laundry, uh, uh, uh, uh, laundry [00:10:00] stations and, and, and kind of access to those hygienic kind of conditions. I think we are seeing progression. But I think, as I say, as I mentioned before, with this cardiogram, it, it, it's a lot of give and take.\n\nSo I think over time we can see the progress in a lot of basic things as, as societies. I think when, when we take like a, a, a smaller, uh, um, uh, a smaller kind of paradigm of, of timelines, we challenge ourselves many times to be able to see those changes very quickly. Uh, but so that on the long term, on the short term, I think like it would be very cool if we can just bring that conversation, uh, to people and to institutions and, and give those policy makers or whoever they might be, uh, our view on why this is important, why it should be a guaranteed kind of, uh.\n\nRight. Amazing. Anything [00:11:00] else that I've missed, you think, or anything that you wanted to make sure we said? I, I, I, I can't think of anything.\n\n",

      "Summary": "Steve Sutton, a retired individual with a finance background, started volunteering at Orange Sky in October. He initially found it slow, but as more people sought laundry services and support, his experiences grew. Through volunteering, Steve gained awareness of homelessness and stressed the need for affordable housing. He highlighted the importance of Orange Sky's broader community impact beyond laundry services. Steve values the interactions with people experiencing homelessness and camaraderie among volunteers, finding fulfillment in giving back. Additionally, he commended Orange Sky's innovations",

      "Transcript": "Alright, just do your name and then spell it would be awesome too. Spell it? Yeah, can. Okay. So just your full name and spell it? Steve Sutton. So S-T-E-V-E and Sutton, S-U-T-T-O-N. Cool. Tell us a bit, you can check it if you want. No, no, it's fine. Tell us a bit about the Steve Sutton story. What's a little intro to who you are and who are you? Well, retired. So sort of worked in finance, business banking for about 36 years. And yeah, retired, I think it was about April 2022. My wife, she's a lawyer. My wife actually volunteers for the Shirley shuttle. So she does some running around volunteering and then said, well, what are you going to do? And I thought, well, I've been working for 36 years. I thought I'd take a little bit of a break for a while. So did that for about 12 months and then kept on saying, well, what are you going to do? And I think I looked at, saw a couple of Facebook ads for Orange Sky. I thought that looks pretty interesting. Wouldn't mind giving that a crack, see what it's like. I did. That was about October last year. What was your first impressions when you first started doing it? How did it feel? It was pretty light on, I think, the first couple of shifts. In fact, we didn't have any sort of washing at all. But anyway, I still thought I'd stick with it, see how it goes. Because they had said they'd had really busy days and then the neighbourhood centre here transferred. Just excuse me one sec. Hi, Steve Sutton. Out for two weeks, so we're trying to get it fixed. I forget to clap my hands because it's super helpful. Keep going. What was your first experience like in Orange Sky? It was a bit quiet to start with, but then the neighbourhood centre relocated here and it's been really good. So a lot of people have come to get, you know, support, food support, hampers. You know, talk to people about trying to get accommodation and then it just sort of picked up from there. So started getting a lot of people. What's your kind of personal take on the impact of Orange Sky for friends and stuff? Like, is there a certain element of it that you think is more better than the other or like a bigger part of it, like the washing, the connection, the conversation? Yeah, look, I think it's a really good service for the friends. You know, some of them just don't have or can't afford to get their laundry done. So, yeah, I just think it's a sort of vital service. You know, particularly the friends here, they seem to be all pretty chilled and easygoing and everyone is really, really appreciative. So, yeah, just nice people. Cool. What's your sort of, has your opinion or take or understanding of particular things changed since you've started? Or like what's the journey been like interacting with people experiencing homelessness in general? Has it changed or the same? Yeah, look, I would say I was probably unaware of how many people are homeless. And, you know, I've sort of done shifts here. I've done shifts at Wyong. I've done shifts at Woi Woi. So you get to see different sort of areas. And it's, you know, it's a lot of different things. Yeah. And it's, yeah, just interesting how many people are sort of living out of vans. And, you know, like you look at it and, you know, like I just sort of like in some cases wonder why. Like, you know, I look at the person they seem, you know, quite nice to chat to. You know, some of them have got interesting backgrounds. Some of them are quite talented. I think Steven over there is some sort of electrical contractor. And you sort of just wonder why are you living out of a van. So, you know, something like that. You know, sometimes you think but for the grace of God go I. So, yeah, look, it's a lot more widespread than I thought, I guess. Have you changed the way in which when you see someone experiencing homelessness, is there a different feeling than when you first volunteered? Or like do you notice different things in the community now like because you're closer to it? Or one thing I always think is interesting is like do you have different conversations with your friends and family? And stuff like that? Or like is that a constant change for you? Yeah, look, you know, a lot of people that, well, sort of friends and family that I talk to sort of say, you know, like what's Orange Sky? They've never sort of heard of Orange Sky before. So, you know, from that sort of perspective, it's good to, you know, just be explaining what it's all about. Hi. Do you want a coffee or a tea, love? No, I'm fine. Thank you. Do you want a toast of cheese, Sam? No, no, I'm good. Thanks very much. You sure you don't want anything? I'm totally fine. Thank you so much for asking that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, just basically just talking to, you know, friends what it is. Yeah. Like it's, there is a lot of conversation on homelessness, like especially in Brisbane where all the tents and stuff like that. Do you have a take on what, like, I suppose what's A, what's needed and then B, like what the impact is on the community? Like what's the, what's the role of Orange Sky is in general? Like, is it broader than just the Washington? Well, yeah. I mean, what's needed is obviously more affordable accommodation. I think that's, you know, how we're going to address that, I don't know, but there needs to be more money into, you know, affordable housing for people. And it's not getting any easier on the central coast. I think we are seen as, you know, like a lot of people move out of Sydney and sort of buy up here, but they're, you know, they're not getting any more money into, you know, the city. They're not getting any more money into the city. They're not getting any more money into the city. So, you know, I think that's a big part of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I think that's, you know, a big part of it. I think we are seeing as, you know, like a lot of people move out of Sydney and sort of buy up here, but they're, you know, buying up what would have been, you know, first home buyers or people that are on, you know, lower socioeconomic, you know, ability to buy a house. It's just pushing up central coast prices to making it more unaffordable. Totally. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Eek! Eek! Yeah. So, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm kind of thinking that whatever you do, the general things that you're doing excitedly when you're around a lot of new stuff that sort of moves into that balance and I wouldn't exactly say is the intentional role but I'd say is the time when is the time setting the please come for me time. How did you decide whether to give it a go? Well, yes. the video, the introductory videos and everything that are in Sky is very good. They've got a great resource base to get in and learn how to do things. You know, like I've only been here since October but started doing the van leader sort of role and the massive information there is just phenomenal. So, you know, like I come from a corporate sort of background and you know the training videos available but Orange Sky's training videos are really good. That's good feedback. Yeah. What do you feel like you get out of it, volunteering and what keeps you coming back? It's probably, I think, well yeah, one my wife makes me, no she doesn't. But look, I think it's the interaction with the people is good. Like just the friends are really, really grateful and will come up to you quite often and say, look thanks, we really appreciate what you do. We really appreciate what you're doing for us and just the camaraderie too, I think, with the other volunteers is good value. So I'll keep doing it for that reason, I think. Yeah, look, I just get a bit of a kick out of doing it, I think. That's great. It's a bit of a difference from a corporate sort of background. It is. What's a leadership role entail for the shift, I guess, for the vehicle level? What do you have to do? For the van or in general, the vans? Well, you've got good support. I mean, I come from a van. I come from finance. I've got no mechanical background at all. And when they sort of tapped me on the shoulder and said, Steve, would you be interested in doing it? I go, yeah, you guys must be desperate. Good with spreadsheets, not with mechanical stuff. But no, look, the support's pretty good. You know, I think what they said for the role is they basically just want someone who's prepared to give it a go, take a crack and see what you can do. So in a few minutes, I'm about to try and get the van. I'm not sure. I'm going to try and see if I can sort out the diesel starvation problem on the dryer. So we'll see how that goes. Sounds intense. Huh? Sounds intense. I was always the worst on the tools with Orange Sky. I didn't know what was going on. Well, I brought the tools, so we'll see what happens. If I fix it, I'll be a hero. If I don't, I'll be, yeah, I knew we shouldn't have put that finance guy in charge of the van. Orange Sky started doing a few different things, like going out of remote control. Like going out to remote communities, like taking over some laundry mats, like doing shipping container type things as well. What place do you think innovation is in charities and like, yeah, like the opportunity to do more, I guess? Like how important is that in terms of the social sector, not the profit sector? Yeah, I like what they do here. I think working in partnership with the local government, I think it's a really important thing. Working with other service providers is the way to go. I, you know, like I just love the way here the neighbourhood centre sort of works together. Like you see them bringing out coffees and sandwiches for the guys so they can sort of sit around and have a bit of a social thing. And you know, the guys get used to seeing each other every Friday, so they turn up. A lot of them turn up early because they know we always turn up early so they can get in there nice and quick. But then, you know, like the laundry will get done, but they'll still be here until we, until we finish and go. But yeah, just the other services that they provide, like trying to find accommodation for the guys or the ladies, you know, the food hampers and different things and yeah, mental health if they need it. All right, that's about it. Anything else you wanted to touch on? I feel like you wanted to say, give some shit to Nick and Lucas. I don't know Nick and Lucas. I don't know Nick and Lucas personally, but it's a good thing that they've done. So yeah, I think it was, yeah, it's just brilliant. I can't believe how fast it's spread, the number of vans around. So yeah, good job boys. 10 years this year. Yeah. Wow. Pretty angry. I didn't think they'd last this long. Nick, that's on top of you Nick. All right, later. Thanks. Cheers. See you later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.\n",

Awesome. So you just have to tell me your full name and then we will spell it maybe too. Spell my name? Yeah. Daryl. And it's a sweet Darrell, D-A-L-R-E-L-L.\n\nAwesome. Pier point PIER. And point as point your finger. Point your finger and the reason it's a sweet Darrell. Yeah. Why does, why do I say it's a sweet Darrell Dar Lee. That's it. See? I got him. My old man used to eat more Darl, Lee Li Chris and chocolate. When the, they used to be the real Darl lee.\n\nYeah. What's it turned into? Fake one. Did someone, Darrel they bought it out. Darrel Lee sold out their business. Yeah, and it was bought out. That's why you don't see it like it used to be. They used to have stores three times as big as that room in there. Wow. Wow. We were at Newcastle.\n\nIt was huge. Oh, [00:01:00] wow. Yes. We talked briefly before, but tell us again a little bit about yourself. What's the Darl story? The Darl story? I'm a chippy by trade carpenter. Cabinet maker only ever worked on two houses. Most it was multi-story buildings in Sydney. I spent a lot of time at doing TAFE and tech, the, whatever they call it these days, and at uni in building.\n\nI went into management in building for quite a few years with one of the big companies, and then I moved from Sydney to. Brisbane with my wife in the 74 floods. And after finishing a project in Brisbane, I was invited to up at a school at Toowoomba. I built a building there back in 1975, [00:02:00] and they were looking for a business manager.\n\nSo I spent 30 years as a business manager at a school. Wow. And a business manager is the same as anywhere, all businesses business. From there, I left there I was in a rotary club and I didn't mind the road trip club at all. Just that. Time passed and it was time for me to do something else.\n\nAnd I got introduced to Tom net. And like a lot of us, we when you first go in that door there, you think, what in the hell am I in for? And it was the best thing I did. The guys are very accommodating their range of professions. From a stockman through legal eagles judge, et cetera.\n\nAnd they all treat you the [00:03:00] same. And so you can walk in without feeling uncomfortable. And I enjoy doing the barbecues. I don't do the barbecuing. I let somebody else do that 'cause I can do the talking. And I'm quite happy to serve people and give 'em a hard time. And yeah, so we do that.\n\nI am involved with the committee now as a committee member and I'm very happy with that. Visit Aged Care Homes and that's rewarding a different way. You just gotta get used to different things that happen. But yeah, so that's a basic story. I do a lot of woodwork and I still do that. I even made the sign that's around, up above the carport round there.\n\nAnd I do a lot of woodwork. My wife passed away just over four years ago, so I started with Tommy just after that. I was looking for something that [00:04:00] was rewarding and different. And it's certainly different in structure, but I think that the way it's run, the comradeship all the rest of it is much better than trying to road tree was fine in the business sense, but Tom net to me was another step forward.\n\nSorry. I've been thinking about the types of gentlemen that come are there, is it a unique person that comes every time? Is there consistency? Is there, is it diverse? What's very diverse? Very diverse. That's why I was saying it's you got a fellow that all he did was contract plowing farming.\n\nAnd I say all he did, that was a skill in itself. I've tried it, not that I stayed there, but right through the different range of different [00:05:00] you got the motor, motor mechanics and the motor repairers type thing. That's only a starting point. People out of the health industry.\n\nBut most of the time, unless you ask, you wouldn't know. Because they're all what we always say. It stays there. What we say is stays there. And yeah. So all discussion revolves around anything but politics and religion. Let's stop laughing. And there is some other thing that can't be talked about when the door open of somebody's so we do have the, as the controlling person in the place, which is a female. She's excellent. And she keeps the. She keeps themselves in a job. So good. So good. What are the activities that you connect most with, like in the other parts of community when you go out? Are there activities you connect [00:06:00] with more than others?\n\nWith Tom Net or, oh I don't do a few things, but I do a couple of the homes, visits there. And that's something that you gotta get used to walking in the, just seeing who's there today and who's not. That's the way I found the hard way, but that's life. And I do, I'm involved in the barbecues a fair bit as I said.\n\nAnd, anything that's going, I'll generally be in it. I don't do mentoring at the Flexi School or Centenary Heights. Having worked at a school for 30 years, not as a teacher just not what I want to do. But the Flexis School is a fantastic exercise. I was involved in originally fixing it up at.\n\nBecause it was one of our Rotary members Oh. That donated the building to [00:07:00] start with. Wow. And John Armstrong was a great advocate for young people and he actually had a building moved from his place up in Neal Street down to where it is today, down chalk drive. Anyway, that's cool. That's getting off the beaten track.\n\nWe can go wherever we need to. Depends on what you're looking for. What, what do you think the impact is for the gentleman that comes to Tom net? From your perception? What My perception get outta it? Probably from what my side of it is being able to talk men to men without any, without any worry about, what you're saying or anything generally. You don't go off the deep end. But and the ladies, they have lots of other activities compared with men. And I was in a rotary club that remains men only. That [00:08:00] wasn't the reason I joined this. It's just that the activities that are offered and just the meeting just once, once I come in once or twice a week and you don't have to, you don't have to attend, you don't have to do anything.\n\nThere's no have to. That's the beauty. A lot of other organizations, you've got a structure. We have a structure. You come in when you feel like it. And if you've got a problem, a lot of guys around will help. I'm happy to drive people to and from, I do that a fair bit. Yes. What else?\n\nThat's cool. What is it that you think that really makes what would and does. Make more people more people who are retired come to Tom that are there because I suppose the difference is people coming in every day and experiencing it, but how do we talk about it for new people that like are thinking about coming, I guess a relaxed [00:09:00] exercise.\n\nAs I said, nobody is above one another. And it's always scary going on a new door when you walk in and there's 10 or 20 people there. But that aside, it takes very little time for most people to settle in. Couple of weeks ago, there was a new fellow started and he walked to the door and he stood at the door and I was sitting just near it, and I, and he said, I said, can I help you?\n\nAnd he said, oh. Is it, this is tom net and I said, yes. He said, can I come in? I said, of course can. He came in and sat down and about 15 minutes later, Rigg was taken over the floor. So that sort of thing does happen. Not everybody's like that. I wasn't quite like that either, but they're inviting, they're and.\n\nThe age group is very spread, but at the top end of course. So our [00:10:00] membership does move from the top, unfortunately. Is there a process for new people that come, or is it very casual and natural The way Very casual. Yeah. Generally somebody's been in to see Anthony and, usually if somebody's run been on the phone, they'll invite them in to speak to Anthony, tells 'em roughly what's happening, and that's what I went through and asked what sort of things you're invite would like to be involved in or involved in, tells you a bit about.\n\nAnd generally it's, I call it fairly casual. It's not a third degree interview, and so very comfortable. I would say that I don't think anybody that I've seen start was uncomfortable. That's so cool. That's all I need, but is there anything you've ever wanted to talk about, something we didn't get to?\n\nI'm just thinking through [00:11:00] that. Not really, no. Not that I can think of. I, Tom, look Tom Net has been great for me. Yes, I was, as I said, I was in a couple of other clubs. But it's great because of the structure doesn't require, the only problem that Tom Ned got is a funding issue because we don't charge fees, and that's part of the basis of the organization, which means the two employees are gonna work for their living.\n\nSo unless they've. Unless they're getting the funds in they don't have a job. And then if they don't have a job, we don't have an organization. And having around about, I think it's about 290 members of which probably in a week you've probably heard before in a week probably only see 40 or 50.\n\nIn a week, but that 40 or 50 is not all the [00:12:00] same. Some of us get bogged down on one day for other reasons. Some are in doesn't matter when we have a great, relaxed president\n\nAnd the manager and assistant are both excellent. That's all I can think. I can think of. That's amazing. I'm gonna take a photo.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Volunteer Hobart - Unidentified\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nWay easier. Mm-hmm. Um, do this stuff. Cool. Tell me your name. I'm Julie. Julie, what's your last name? Do we need that? Ah, no. How do you spell Julie? Uh, J-U-L-I-E. Cool. How long have you been volunteering? Um, a bit over two years. Cool. And what, what made you, well, how'd you first, um, you about Orange guy? That's a good question.\n\nUm. I am actually not sure. I can't recall. Don't know. What, what would you think was the pathway into volunteering then? Like what, what? Um, I've always volunteered. Alright. Always done some kind of volunteer work. Um, even back when I was at uni. Um, I. Many years ago. Yeah. Um, always done some kind of volunteer work.\n\nI just think it's important to be involved in the community and to help those who need it. What's, um, the special things about Orange Sky to keep you coming back and not taking on another type of volunteering or leaving? I think it is knowing that the people that you are helping desperately [00:01:00] need the help.\n\nSo they really do need that help and they're, they're coming back all the time. Um, and wanting that help, wanting that support, and it's also the team that I work with as well. They're a great team. Cool. Yep. What's, um, is there anything that surprised you, um, working at Iron Sky or is there something that you sort of already always connected with and like your philosophy hasn't changed on things or is has things shifted within yourself?\n\nNo, I mean, my background is in working in community services, so working with people in need, um, in different areas. So there were no surprises with the issues that come up or reasons why people are in this situation. Um, none of that surprised me. Um, I don't think there's been any drastic shift in the way that I see things or no.\n\nProbably because of that past experience. Yeah. Um, for some I think it would be a surprise. Yeah. What's, um, the good, the bad and ugly from [00:02:00] like the volunteering experience at Orange Sky? Like, are they very good and bad things? Are they, is it fine? Is it easy? Is it, what's your take on that? Um. Probably has good and bad, like any role, any job, um, bad.\n\nSometimes people don't behave, um, as you would like, and that's okay. We just deal with it. Um, we haven't had anything too drastic, but, um, sometimes there are things going on around you that you'd rather not deal with, but that's okay. That's fine. Um, good, great team, great support from inside the service that we work with inside there.\n\nUm, and the people, people that come along and access the service are lovely. Um, very, very grateful for the service that's provided to them. Um, and very friendly, chatty. They've been fine. Cool. Yeah. And what about like, um, [00:03:00] process and stuff, like from the organizational part of it? Mm-hmm. Is that all easy?\n\nAnd is there anything that you would change or. I think there's a fair bit of change. Yeah, I think there are definitely things that they could do better as an organization. Um, I know that they do often need more volunteers, um, and I think there are things they could do better to attract volunteers and to keep the volunteers they have.\n\nUm. Yeah. Um, it's sometimes a struggle to get some basic things that we need to do a shift. So I think, um, having access to cleaning products on a regular basis and not running out would be very helpful. Um, it doesn't happen that often, but when it does, it's like it really shouldn't. Um, I think connecting with the volunteers a little bit more [00:04:00] would probably.\n\nEnable the organization to keep their volunteers. Um, people who volunteer, give up their time. It costs them money often, so you do need to actually show them that you appreciate it so that they feel valued and wanna stay. Um, I know there's been surveys in the past about, um, our experience as volunteers, but I question whether any of that's actually.\n\nPaid attention to, and any of it's read by those higher up. Um, and if so, I haven't seen any changes, so I, that's why I question that. Um, yes, um, the support service that they have, or if there's an issue with the shift or an issue with a washer or dryer that needs a bit of work. Um, you can phone them and [00:05:00] sometimes it's not answered and you leave a message and sometimes you get a response and sometimes you don't.\n\nSo that probably needs to be looked at as well. Mm-hmm. Um, to make life a bit easier for the volunteers. Yeah. Awesome. That's the best feedback I've ever heard. Right. Um, I don't work either, so. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just know, I just know from all the years I've done volunteering, like, um, everyone does it differently.\n\nOkay. But there are some things that all of them should actually do. Like even just something simple as, um, like there's national Volunteer Week. Acknowledging the volunteers during that time would be really nice. It's a very small step, but one that could actually be the difference between someone going, oh, I feel valued, or no, I don't.\n\nUm, great acknowledge when someone's worked or, or provided a year service or five year service or 10 year service, like just little things like that can make a very big difference. Um, the stuff I'm doing is around voice and [00:06:00] story. How do you think some of these things. Can better get to make their way to, to headquarters in the right way.\n\nUm mm-hmm. Like, do you think there's mechanisms that Ho Sky can put in place to support the voice of volunteers to lift a bit more and for things to pass? Or do you think there are mechanisms for that already? I, oh, I'm not sure because I, um, I mean there are, there are shift leaders, there are people who manage the shifts.\n\nBut I dunno what the chain of command is following that. I don't know. Mm. Um, so I dunno how effective any of that is. We can provide feedback and fill out issues on the shift reports, um, but where it goes from there is kind of out of our control. Awesome. What's your, what would be your sort of idea of best case scenario for Orange Sky over the next 10 years?\n\nSo they've had 10 years. Mm-hmm. Do you think this is like. Betting down procedures and making it better is more [00:07:00] important. Or do you think scaling up to offer more services is important? Or even going international for example? Like what do you think would be the best case scenario for our friends and volunteers?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I think looking at what they currently have in the areas that they have them and going, okay, is this as good as it gets or do we need to improve? I think that would be the first step. Um, definitely expanding on the services. Where needed, but who decides on where it's needed and how they decide?\n\nI don't know. That's not my job. Mm. Um, but in terms of expanding, yeah, there's probably need. Um, but how they do that, whether they can attract the volunteers, is that, that would be the barrier. Um, internationally, I don't know. Um, I'm sure there, there would be a need. And there was a lady here who. A few months ago, there's a lady here she was living in, was [00:08:00] she in Belgium?\n\nAnd she was saying that there was a very similar service over there. So when she saw this, she came and had a look and went yes, it looked like, looks identical. So there are obviously some services elsewhere that, um, mirror what happens here. Yeah, yeah. There's one that's very closely mirrored orange sky in Athens where we just went and saw that.\n\nUm. And then, um, one of the co-founders of Rain Sky just started this idea of a global washing alliance. Yeah. So I think the idea with that is orange, sky doesn't necessarily need to like, scale up. Yeah. They can just park tapping. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And that makes sense. Yep. Don't reinvent the wheel. Yeah. Um, rad, that was wicked.\n\nAnything else you, you've always wanted to say or no? Anything else? I don't think so. No. Cool. Yep. Well done. Okay. Thank you. That's it. Nailed it.\n\nIt doesn't break really easy.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Hello. Oh, chair for you. So good. I was worried that I wouldn't know the answer. All right. So first off, if you could do your name and spell your name, your full name for me, it would be awesome. Pam Wellham. Just P-A-M-W-E-L-L-H-A-M. Stop. Tell us a little bit about how you first found out about Orange Sky. I found out about Orange Sky just so I think on the radio or something. And then I asked one of the gentlemen who was in charge of Orange Sky in the Hunter area to come along to a Rotary meeting and talk to the Rotarians about Orange Sky. Awesome. And so it just went from there. He just spoke about how many shifts there are during the week in Hunter. And I asked him whether he needed people, and he wanted some people at Belmont to first. But then there weren't many people at Belmont. It was over COVID. So then they moved it down here later, and so I'm here. Because it's reasonably close to Belmont anyway. So it made it convenient for me. And so you're part of Rotary? Yeah, I'm in the Rotary Club of Belmont, yes. What's that? What's the Rotary about? It's a service organisation. So it's similar to Lions in that it's an organisation of people who want to see an improvement in the community. It's humanitarian, peacemaking, economic development, helping people in our local area as well as overseas. And yeah, it's just elsewhere, just in schools, anything. The motto is service above self. So it says you're working for other people. So it's a good motto, and most Rotarians live by it. So it's a really good organisation. And this is just an adjunct to it. I'm the only one in my club who's actually volunteered because the others are fairly busy. Some work still, but I'm retired, so it's much easier if I'm retired. What's that do for that sense of community and that kind of stuff? Yeah. I think it's good. I think people who are particularly retired, but other people as well, I think giving back to the community is something that really makes you feel better. Volunteers always seem to be a happier type of people, and they like to just see other people benefiting from the time that they have free. Once you've been working in the community for so many years, it's good to be able to do something, not just sit around and go to the beach, which is nice. But it is good to be able to give back a bit to the community. Why did you... What stood out for you, I guess, at Orange Sky that made you feel like it was something you'd want to do? Well, I think because I'm aware there's a lot of homeless people. We don't see the homeless very much around here, but I'm very fortunate in life. So when you see other people who are worse off than you are, you want to be able to do something for them. And Orange Sky just worked well because I'm sure they're... are more homeless than actually come here. And I know people who come to Orange Sky aren't necessarily homeless. Sometimes they're living in their car, which is homeless, but, you know, they live in their car, they can get a shower, but they can't find... get their washing done. Or they're in public housing, or they've been given an opportunity to go to a motel, and motels don't have... necessarily have washing facilities. So we often get some people who have been homeless who the different service organisations, have lined up accommodation in a motel, but they come here and they wash their clothes until they find a place with a washing machine and drying facilities. What's your sense of the broader community and, like, doing a tough duty? Like, do you have a concept of that? And has that changed since going here? I think... I think... Well, when I first started, it was COVID. And so people were... they weren't out and about. And I think emotionally or mental health issues arose because they didn't meet with people. So we were doing shifts during COVID. I mean, making sure we got social distancing and doing all the correct things, but it allowed people to come and talk to us and have someone to assist them. The service organisations that are close, providing food and things were often close. Since COVID, I think there are so many people who are homeless. Even in this area, because it's such a beautiful area to be in, people could be down by the beach. You know, they might be... they might catch a bus and go to a certain point where it's quite isolated, but they can catch a bus here and they can get their washing done. So it seems to be on the increase. And also domestic violence. You often have people who come here who have been relocated because of domestic violence and can't provide for their family to live. They can't provide for their family to make sure the children have clean clothes to go to school or just clean clothes necessarily. How... Is it often that you are asked to describe what Orange Sky does? And is there a certain way in which you describe it to your friends, family or others? Yeah, I have been asked a few times about... Particularly if you go shopping and you've got the T-shirt on. Do you have a spiel or things you go to? Or is it like you change it up every time? It's a bit of a variety. I don't... I don't learn something. I have in the past, in different organisations do the rote learning. But I think I try and gauge what the person's... What's going to interest the person more. Is it... Sometimes it's how often do you do it? Yeah, that's what they want to know. But yeah, usually I say Orange Sky assists the homeless and those in need to get... Have clean clothes on a regular basis. That's cool. Yeah, so... What's the balance of support that's almost like... Like someone's washing something and some of it's like connections, some of it's like just someone to talk to. What's the balance of that do you think? I think... I think in our shift it tends to be pretty balanced because people will bring their washing. We used to get a lady who came here and I'm sure that she got the clean clothes out of the cupboard to bring here to wash because they're all neatly folded. And when she saw that I actually unfolded them when they went in the washing machine, she said, Oh, I'll make sure I do that next time. So she wanted a chat. She was living in a home unit but she couldn't actually get washing done. She had a line so she could dry it but she still often stayed here so we could dry it for her as well because she liked the talking. She was a very bright lady and liked to engage in quite in-depth discussions at times. That's cool. What do your friends and family think about what you do? Do they ask random dumb questions or do they ask good questions? No, they usually just say, What are you doing again? Are you volunteering again? I go, well, you can come along. Oh, no, I've got to go to work. Yeah, but that's the biggest thing with my family. So what are you doing today? How come someone who's retired is so busy? What's the value for you doing all this stuff? Like why not just go to the beach? Why volunteer? Why do this? I don't know. It's something you make up, I think. I think the way we were brought up to give back to the community, to just don't do a half job at things. So when you don't have a job, you kind of go, Oh, I've got to do something. I can't sit around. I mean, I would sometimes love not to be able to go to a shift or something like that. But when you're rostered, you have to be here. So it's a bit, yeah. I've got enough in my life really to do other things, but it's always good and it's great to be able to catch up with some of the people. The friends who come on a regular basis, they change over the time that you know them. So one of the gentlemen hasn't been here today. He hasn't been here for a few weeks. So we're all a bit worried. Where is he? What's happened to him? He could be just taking a break on holidays, but he's very meticulous. Every week he has an apron to wash. So I think that's astounding actually. Yeah. Because I don't use a bath. I don't use an apron when I'm cooking. But anyway, so it's a bit of worry when you do build up that rapport. Yeah, yeah. And usually when they come the next week, there'll be some explanation about what it is. But you do, they are a friend in a way, but we don't disclose anything. They don't necessarily have to talk. The gentleman I was talking about, he really doesn't really want to talk. He'll go and play basketball. Yeah. While we do the washing. He won't sit with us. And when we're finished, we'll just yell for him to come and he'll fold everything, put it in his suitcase and we'll see him next week. That's cool. Do you think your perceptions have changed at all from starting to volunteer to now in relation to people that are doing it for you? Or do you think that you already had a very good... I think I probably, I think the nature of my work in the past, I probably had, knew what was available around the world. I think I had a lot of experience and I think I had a lot of experience with what was available around and what people lacked. And yeah, I just thought it was such a good idea to have a mobile laundry. And I think it's amazing that, you know, Lucas and his mate came up with the idea and persevered after school. I just think it's amazing. And it's a pity some of the other, other young ones who have got ideas don't carry them through sometimes. Because kids generally are good. It's an interesting point. Like, I think Orange Sky sometimes gets seen as like welfare laundry support sometimes. But then also it also, it's like an innovation type place. Where do you think like creativity, innovation plays in supporting people doing it? Like, does it need, do you need a lot of innovation or does it get in the way of... No, I think you do need innovation because this van can be taken anywhere. Really. I mean, if you haven't got a water supply, we can have clean water. We can have water there. And having, I mean, we're lucky here. We've got all the, we can have power if we want. We've got water laid on. So we're right. We can water the plants with our grey water. But other places, more remote areas, they mightn't have that. Even though they might have water on, it might be town water. It might be tank water. So you don't want to take the resources of some particular areas. And we're not a remote area. So, but in the remote area, it would be good to be able to have access to a van like this. And, yeah, it's a pity that we don't have the showers as well. Because I think that's a big need to have a shower. But, but yeah, the people, at least they have clean clothes. And they feel good. They come and have a talk. Their mental health improves, I think, because they are talking to people. And, you know, we can have a joke. It's not all serious chatter. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Is there anything you wanted to say that you don't think you got to? Is there anything you wanted to say? I think it's good. I think it's a marvellous innovation. As you said, it's innovation. And we need more innovation to help us. We've been doing the same thing for many years. We should, you know, use some of the resources that are available to see what, how we can better help the people who aren't as fortunate as we are. Good grab, that last bit. Good. All right, well done. Okay. I'm just going to take a photo of you now.\n",

      "Transcript": "\"text\": \" Uncle Gary got one, just the other one and someone else, I think the women's group got that. Oh yeah. Mm. So one thing, Brad, could you say your name and spell it just so I've got it on video? Gary Hartman, G-A-R-Y-H-A-R-T-M-A-N. Gary, what are you doing here, Brad? What's your vibe? Men's Shed here? I'm Men's Shed Coordinator for Nook and Tardy, ourari, our children and family centre. We just basically do woodwork. We just start off the almond circle really, and that's where it really starts. If the blokes are in the room wanting the main stuff, we're there to help them. We started with making pallet work. We made beds, medicine cabinets for the elderly where they can lock it up. We was making them, that's where we was making these sizes now and that and then you know we started doing the bike programs. Then getting bikes, building them up, redoing them up and giving them to kids that are walking from one school to the other, like high school kids, school kids, primary school kids. That container at the front, that was full of bikes from that Townsville last big flood. Yeah, that was to the top. We got rid of them for four and a half years. Took us to get rid of all them bikes, all the kids that are walking. Yeah. How many fathers come often? How many old fathers? It varies. You know, you get, you know, because I don't only get men walking from off the street, we get the men from CASH, that's our diversion recovery centre. Some come out of the jail, come straight into that system and then, you know, they are like, Gigi and all them do programs with them and then they heard about us and they bring them in to us then and we just like you know bring them in for a yarn and then some start doing artwork painting there and the wire work that we did we was looking at ideas where these fellas can make money out in the community when they leave this place so the wire work that was easy because you can find work wire anywhere in the community man you know and if they can make these totems of them, put them on the board and sell them small enough for community or even govenise fencing. Bunnings even could look at it, fucking buying it, real ASOP. Buying it. Give them avenues where they can make money out of nothing, pallet, wire, artwork. Why do you reckon most fellows come in? What do they get out of nothing, you know, pallet, wire, artwork, you know. Why do you reckon most fellows come in? What do they get out of it? You reckon, like, in terms of their general health and well-being and that sort of stuff, what's, what do you reckon? The honour. Like, it's a real honour circle for them, you know. They can sit back, be safe, say what they want and, you know, get it out off their chest and no one will judge. We don't judge them any. You know, everyone's out off their chest and no one will judge. We don't judge down here. You know, everyone's just about being where they were. We were every man's being, you know. Osama Ghana, you know. Like, I mean, we sit down here, we yarn up. You know, we started a suicide march fucking six years ago. We was the only Indigenous men in Australia to do a suicide march. was the only Indigenous men in Australia to do a suicide march. We had 150 men lead it from our men's group to the community service boys. They all led it and then the women and kids come behind us, we marched through the street. Bang, that went off, eh? We had people around Australia, Alice Springs, Mount Luby, they heard about her story, Canadian Indians. Then they sent us a message now and they heard what we did with their suicide march. Yeah, we're going back to the bases, going back at the bush. You know, sometimes you don't have to do the cultural stuff. You can just sit down and yawn and listen, really. And then that was it. We just picked up from there. And you know like the mount luby one old fella sent that message he only had three three blokes in his men's shed and then when he started doing what we're doing and did that suicide march because he was getting the same problem suicide we lost 22 people in one month in mount isa so then bang they did theirs So then bang, they did this, marching there thing. Now they got, he's saying they got 250 men doing the men's group now. And they're just getting their strength back. You know, leading the way. Helping the ladies actually, you know. The way I see it anyway. And what's, um, Brady of course does a lot of work for the young fellas. Is there a pathway for the young fellas to come into the men's shed or what do you think the young fellas got to do? Yeah. Like Brady will bring them in. You know, we, we've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of young fellas. We've got a lot of work with the young fellas. Is there a pathway for the young fellas to come into the mansion? Yeah, Brady will bring them in. We don't force nothing on them first. We just sit down young and explain what we do or we just let them look and listen. Sometimes when they're ready, they'll want to try and fix a bike or do woodwork or do the wire work. We'll get our Uncle Dean who's teaching them how to weld and oxy work, getting the trade out of it. I think out of it all, out of the 10 years of me, I think two of them were in the mines. One's got a trade as a boilermaker, now he's flying in and flying out from Townsville. And then the other fella's the same thing, back in Alice, doing the same thing, flying in and flying out from Townsville, got it, you know. And then the other fellas, the same thing, back in Alice, doing the same thing, flying in and flying out. Because he learnt that little, just messing around down near Weldon. Because he came through Flexi and Brodie. It was like most of the boys that he gets, they all come through the shed, like through Flexi, Youth Justice, T2S, you know, they bring all their kids down here. All the gangs never had no fight. They jammed up really once they see the hard work. The old fellas, they get jammed up thinking they can't get smart down here because of culture. What's a lot of fellas in the city, they think about Mount Isa as a place where youth crime is quite prevalent or a huge issue. As a local person, how do you think about young people and some of the things in which is happening in the community? Do you have a different concept? Nah, there's nothing here for them really. Nothing to keep them busy. All the programs, they're not structuring it right. All the services here, they're still getting it wrong. They should be working with you, the service you're using one day, help them out the other service. Keep them busy, not just one day here then come and see them another two days later, every three days. If you're going to use all the service, use them. You know, that service help him this day, that's help, you know, help him with this that day. Come back here, we do that to that day, you know. You know, they, at the moment, all the service is just coming in, ticking their boxes. At least Brady, he'll come in, but he stays the long walk, you know but he stays the long walk. He does the long walk with our men. He's done the trips. He's lined up all these trips for all these boys. He's done the walk, he's heard the talk, heard the pain. And he's even been through pain. Poor fella. He's been through a lot too. But that's the journey men take. We've got to heal, but it's better we heal together than sitting at home, bearing up, and ending up in jail. Yeah, Brodie's gone through a pretty interesting transition now, trying to work out how he can build a living and support young people. What advice would you give to him in terms of taking a bit of a leap and trying to work on doing more camps and doing more of his own stuff in community? Do you think he's got potential to have an impact on his own? He's doing it now. He's got people from Doomadgee and Birdtown right down the head, the know, the Yarra, they respect him because he's listening. You know, he's doing, you know, just don't worry about the outside world, just do what you do because, you know, the work will tell you a story, not negativity, you know. And he's doing it right because blokes are asking for it, where's Brad? You know, we wonder when's this trip when's that trip or even when we go that bush we should ring brady and get these boys you know yeah and i was he knows you know he sits there and listens you know not there to not to be mean but like most of them come in here as a contract and they fly and tick their boxes and they're out and then where's brady he'll walk the walk and do the talk with these men, you know. Feel their pain like we all do, you know. And then try to help each other. Yeah, that's, you know. It's so important, right? And the best thing about his young, you know, he's taken that aboard, he could end up like the rest of these young fellas, you know. Fucking stuck on the drugs, can't get down the rut, but yet he's changing. He's showing these young fellas, you know, fucking stuck on the drugs, can't get out of the rut, but yet he's changing. He's showing these young fellas, you know, it can happen. Just take that step and look at the big picture, you know. What next for your community, you know. That's what it's all about for these young fellas. The boredom. I've worked a bit of a path with Brodie trying to work out how we can get him funding and get him to get supported and a lot of the feedback is he needs more governance, more staff, more protocols, whatever. But we believe that it's more important to have the trust of the community. What would you say to like, they always come back to this idea of like how much consultation have you had? What's that word consultation mean for elders and community? Like I think government have got it wrong in terms of how they're doing it. Like I think they want meeting minutes and where you went to shoot. But what do you reckon consultation really is with older colleagues the community? Well, sitting down on the grass, on the dirt, with the fire, that's our consultation, without the pen and paper, and just actually sit down and listen. And I mean, four walls and a piece of paper, statistics and that, do this, do that, oh, you gotta go that way, because statistics ain't always right. And a simple fucking thing of just sitting down and starting a fire could solve a lot of things, you know. And I ain't, as, that, that's, that's people that haven't done that, you know. Have lost, lost their part too, I reckon, that asked, asking us boys to do what, tick off their ticks, you know. Where they, bring them out and tell them to come and sit in this ground and eat that bush tiger, you know. Bring them out here, tell them to come and sit in this ground and eat that bush dog out here, you know. They'll be catching your fucking gut right there and see it all, you know. There's your consultation, you know, that's where you get your healing, you know, besides the four walls. You look at these fellas, like even young fellas, they come here, they do all these programs in there, they come straight out, they do the programs for the correctional, it's the same thing. They do it twice again and then they gotta do the other programs and it's got the same fucking thing. Like they've done it three times and it's, how many times can you drum it in them? You know, like, that turns them straight off and then, like walking in like are boom, boom, you know, overloaded. I did that, I did that, yeah, I know. Nah, we're not doing nothing, we're not doing that program, brother. You just come in here, you can sit down, run away from your missus. I'd rather you run here than stay there and bash them, you know. And some do. Some, it does work. They come down here, know and some do some it does work they come down here sit down steam off and I will ring Brady and you know and he'll hook him up to Daniel he look well you know that psychiatrist life you know and that's where I normally refer to Brady then he's come grab this fella or have a yarn to him you know and he'll get Brady or I'll have a yarn with him or Daniel you know know. But with Brady, no. He's been working with the psychologists, I really reckon, because when I go at them treachery, we don't, you know, you get that with your men, I reckon, and the young fellas. What's this Red Bench thing here? Nah, that's that thing there we started. the police that was I think that four years ago We did that they asked us that if we was interested and then we started making these benches now for the Red Rays Foundation it started off as and then and then they And then they just we started building them with the young fellas we had uh t2s flexi boys and the young fellas teaching them how to weld like it was but then you know he went on the bigger things uncle and then i started because he taught us how to do it so far we made how many four five eight eight of them we made through the four years we made. You probably see them around me and I said that like we these ones here that we did with ADRA, we made them and the women painted them and they did the artwork on them. And that's for DV where the women you know and there's some good artwork on that, but it was a joint venture with the men, you know, for DV. And I support the women's movement, you know? And yeah. Hey. How you doing? Same way. This is Calvary, brother boy with the play group next door. Oh, really? Yeah, he's one of the dads. He used to work here. But yeah, he got his daddy in there, and they got a playgroup, my missus runs the playgroup. But yeah, that red benches went all failed. These here, we made four of those, and this is the last one that old fella made because he's got dimension there. And when he made this, that's when he was starting to get it. And then we getting the young fellas to help that old fella. Yeah, with measurements and all this and all that. But yeah, that's the one now he did. And we were just talking about this thing before, trying to make some beds here. What do you reckon the situation with people's beds in Manawai is it hard to get beds in a like yeah what's your take yeah because at the moment like we've got a lot of homeless people down the river and that's all they is mattresses and like you said you know diseases mattress material you know the scabies you know all the bed sores and everything. But with those things at least they can fold it up and put it up and then put it off the ground or even sleep off the ground because I reckon that's a good thing because we can help you with that. We can source the thing and the men can make it down here, you know, like you said. And we got a lot, you know, and there's a lot of sleeping on the dirt, rain, you know. With us doing that, that'll help them out. Keep moving that mud, you know, let's visit to the doctor, ask him, you know. Scabies and all that. And then on these grounds here, you know, there's a lot of people from Alice Springs there, man. There's not only one group, we've got about seven different groups down there that won't even interact with each other. And they don't even talk to each other because of their culture down here. You know, that way with them beds, at least that'll stop them fighting, you know, stealing each other's bed or shit like that. Now, at least it'll be tidy, they can fold it back up, leave it under a tree and then when they want the bed, they can just pull it out and take it out then. Or just have it there and stack it up, you know, for the cancer. Yeah and like we're pretty close with Orange Square, those cats. What do you think of Orange Square and what they're doing? Ah that's good. That way, you know, at the moment, like I've got these old fellas, at least, you know, the house service will say clean sheet and clean bed, you know. Well so far with this Orange Square that's good because these old fellas at least you know the house service aside clean sheet and clean bed you know well so far with this orange car that's good because these old fellas come in and they bring their gear in once a week to wash their clothes and you know stop that soreness and visits to the doctor and you know now we and then if we can get them beds well then that'll even stop some more you know for the homeless down here because we got a lot down this river and, you know, for the homeless down here, because we've got a lot down this river. And that, you know, we could even teach them down there to make it, you know, and you want this bed, here, well, come on, give me a hand, make it, you know, and they can take the skill to make it. And they, well, take pride, that's my bed, you know. And they probably would, too, as long as we make it before 10 o'clock. But they probably would, you know. Some of of them because I started off there they had raggles with this mansion and that's what we found out they were good but before 10 o'clock that's it they're going you know but they would sit there and yarn and I tell their stories and that have a feed and that and then go yeah we've been able to put them in some houses too yeah because like some of the mattresses especially are super expensive on Palm Island to get and these ones are free at the moment and yeah I think that economical thing of, because we're even thinking you can melt down your own plastic and inject the crates. Yeah well that's what. We haven't managed to do that. Yeah well the council asked us to you know with the bottle tops, with the plastic bottles, they want us to take control of, they help us set up to crush the plastic and make tables out of it. They want the manager to take over that initiative where these blokes can make money and that, but because of the area we're in, we can't really. I said, if we can get outside of town and do it where they can do it in peace and you know, no thing in that, you know. And we got that one area, but at the talks at the moment, we're thinking of doing that actually. Man, I'd love to help with that. Yeah, you know, the mamba doing it on the coast where they get all the plastic bottles melting and then they make the benches, even with the lids. And I just, I said and I said oh shit you know that'll be good to do because then that way you can take that concept to the communities. Savory soil can log up, do with you. They could make massive, make money out of it. So what do you reckon you need to make that a reality? Is it a place and the machinery? It's the machinery. It's the melting system and all that they reckon, where it melts it all and flatten. There's a bit of equipment council put us onto that site, showed us that site and that, and they was even willing to help us get funding for it. But see, they say, look, they was gonna do that for us. And now we have to mention took over. I don't know if they're gonna still do that now. I think they might be putting that onto the ranges, I think. I'd love to learn more and help and see if there's a way in which we can get the men shed over the line. I've actually got a, we've got some friends who do plastic recycling in Brisbane. Yeah. They're pretty good at it. Because I was talking to one young fella in Palm now, because we went down with Brady now for that Quatsip meeting down Brisbane, probably about two months ago. I was talking to that young fella from Palm now. He's got a men's group there with that old fella. He's an older. Oh, what's his name? He's a preacher too. Richard? I think he's a little short and ugly. Richard Cassidy. Yeah, yeah. I've got his photo here. Yeah, we were just the Minga Minga Rangers. That's what their name is in Palm Island. Richard Cassidy is the CEO of the Minga Minga Rangers. Oh, I think, I've got his photo here. Yeah, we were just the Minga Minga Rangers in, that's what their name is in Palm Island. Oh. And Richard Cassidy's the CEO. Yeah. Him and there's a man as well, Ebenezer, he's on the council of Palm Island. Oh. So you might have met Rich, because he's always got a cowboy hat on. Nah, nah, he was a younger fella, because he had like a normal ant like us. Gotcha. But that old fella, he was a Papua New Guinea or South Sea fella, but he was dark, but he's a preacher. He's a preacher fella, but he runs that men's group there. Oh, yeah, right. He was the one that they just repainted all that palm cemetery. Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah. And he was telling me that because I was helping him, trying to send him that link how we get that second bite off Woolies. I was trying to link his group, Palm Island, to give him that link so they can get on that Woolies second bite where they, 12 pallets. Yeah. They donate 12 pallets every three months or four months. Oh, yeah. And then you can offload it to community. Yeah, I was trying to send him that link now. It's crazy how all this stuff's connected. We're going back to Palm in December. Yeah. Because that's what I was telling him now, because my grandmother's mother buried on that Phantom Island. She's from one year. She's from Kemwil, see? Because we're still in the, we're in that stolen generation, my mother, her mother. Because her mother was there and then she got taken from Kemmweel twice, got put on palm and then bang she escaped, got back and then next thing they sent her back and then they put her on Leprosy Island and then Fandom Island and then that's when we was trying to find her but we couldn't find her trail, like from Kemmweel's side we couldn can find it and then that's where our ABC was doing that TV show about Fannamallam and then when we looked in the background of that cross that was our grandmother's mother's name and that's what I was telling them we're probably related because that's where her the mother was and then her sons and daughters sons were sent down to Cherbourg and Warrabinda and yeah down there. It was a small world there. Yeah that's why I freaked out on it. I said let's redo the graves, I wouldn't mind doing that here. You know get the men on wintertime we'll go through and just help out and just paint them redo them and pour things poor things yeah we're going to work with um ranger bar the the straggler island um yeah they've been doing a lot of stuff with justice they got some justice reinvestment stuff um because that's where we was telling the fellas yeah with that course of reason they like with brady's program he blew like they were that all with brady and you know how we all mix with that all with Brady and you know how we all mixed with ADRA and the Menchet, how we all worked and elaborate together. They were blown away by that, you know, how Brady gets the young fellas, you know, training, fitness. Now we do these bush camps. Now they want to get on the board and we say, yeah, you get on board that way, you know, we can bring our people to this beautiful country on summertime and you can come up here and win it all. You know, they was all for it. Yeah, they was all for it. You know, I met one old fellow in Kawanyama that he's got set up there for his men. As soon as they come out of jail, they don't go back in the community. They go up to that air station. They stay out there and stay sober, no women allowed, you know, and they can come back in and go back out and work out in the community but no alcohol in that thing and they got house, beds, kitchen, everything where they can stay out, you know, instead of going back into the system of aim and alcohol and drugs and shit. Holy bro. Right, that was mind-blowing. Mmm. Like. the grog and shit. That was mind-blowing. We're so close with Brodie and with everything I think to work out how sustainable camps, sustainable wellness happens. I think it's got to do with just collaboration. Yeah, that's it. And plus trust us. Trust this boy I trust blokes that go with him, you know, because when you've got to write down what you're doing on the stats, what are you doing, you've got this, you've got that, you've got that. Why is all these questions? We've been doing this for the last six years and we haven't lost no one. No one's got bitten, but you still question the black men. You know, where we're going with TAs. We were right, you know. We get protected, you know, and TAs we were right you know we get protected and you still you still question us and I yeah it's a very huge mismatch of this is how it's supposed to happen from a government and legislative and like procedure process yeah to this huge gap between like how do you actually do that in community. Although like the culture, where's the culture? Mate, you been at it? You been at Bushy and I? Half of them say, yeah we have. It's going out. There's your culture. You think we just go out there and talk shit? We actually do things just like, I mean, with that suicide, mate. That's how we, that evolved, that March on, it evolved because one follower here sat, came in, and he was upset, you know. Like, I mean, we lost 22 people in one month. He was upset at funerals, you know. And we sat down there as men, you know, we were sitting down here. I'm over it, yeah, we're all over it. What can we do? You know, what do you mean? We can't see the signs. So we went. I've got Uncle, he's a living too, Uncle Kevin, Uncle Gorda, I think. He was the mental health thing. I approached him and asked him if he could come down do little talks with us about the suicide You know, so he comes down and I've got this other old fella He came from another section and he brought him in We grabbed the men we was going to the parks and we were sitting there doing scenarios We'd put on the feed and had the telephone call. Nah bros you and I ain't doing that stuff You can have my gear. I'm going for a walk. You know that stuff. We was doing scenarios like that all talking straight up, you know, and he was doing the real hard shit, you know, the truthful stuff, not beating around the bush. Some of the boys were fucking at war, man. They didn't even, they don't have me, you know, and we was doing that every week. But then within that every week, them boys were, them boys were alcoholics and half stuffed druggies and that. But they, some of them even saved a couple, you know. We had blokes walk coming in the shed with nooses in their bags, you know. Walking around, oh, what you doing? Nah, just got off a walk. Oh, you still got it? Yeah. You never got rid of it yet? Nah, we couldn't take it off them. They'll just make another one, you know. True God, but I was still walking around for years and then, you know, once they started coming in this main shed, we was taking them them outings and that. They'd thrown it. And I was once going to WA and working there. He's over it, you know. Stepped up and the other ones's through me just doing that suicide talks you know even you know the tools to do it now really tells you there's a that's indigenous man now you know topping up or what can get out of the ship you know indigenous men but when it's deeper than that you need you know well take us for a tour around this shady i'm interested to see\",\n",

      "Transcript": "A glare, right? I reckon we're pretty good. Yep. Alright, brothers, you're just going to look at me over here. I'll try and make sure I can do both of these things good. Carl, so just tell me your name and spell it would be awesome, your full name. It's Carl, Carl with a K, K-A-R-L, Whitney, W-H-I-T-N-E-Y. Awesome. Tell us a little bit about yourself, Carl. How do you like to describe who you are and a bit about yourself? Look, I'm 50 and I've just recently moved here. I've got a shoulder reconstruction and I've sort of come from down south. I was working down there, that's where I had the work accident. I used to live here before and I got good rapport with the landlord and that's why I'm straight back into the same place I was at before. And that's pretty much it at the moment. I do physio, get the shoulder sorted out. I've got a full shoulder reconstruction. And that's just the main thing I'm getting over at the moment, trying to get back into the workforce. It'll happen but it's just like probably another four more months of healing, physio. So this is part of the walk. I walk every morning and do the washing at the same time. I could probably only nearly need to do the washing once a week but the yarn and the chat and the stop off point and sort of like in a like 2K walk every morning. So this place is pretty good for that. I probably do that every day. I probably don't really need help but it is really helpful at the same time as well. In the bigger picture, the recovery picture, that's pretty much where I'm at at the moment. But I'm doing really good actually. Things are going really well. That's cool. And what's your kind of, was there a few ups and downs in life and like? Just mainly this injury. This injury and not being able to work and they wrote me off for work and put me on the pension card. And it was like two months before I could get the surgery and it's just like lots of pain and just full mobilisation of the shoulder. I couldn't do anything that I used to do. I wasn't allowed to drive anymore. All sorts of stuff was just like it was, I had to drive up here which was really hard. I had to do lots of hard things in the quiet. It wasn't really supposed to do just to, because I couldn't live down there anymore. It was too expensive where I was and without work it just couldn't happen. It's more capable living in the circumstances I'm at now. So it's mainly just getting over this is the main big thing. Otherwise I'd probably still be working where I was. Before, as soon as I had the accident they laid me off. So that was pretty much just the shoulder. And what sort of things changed? Do you think after the accident, like how did life sort of shift a bit for you? Oh, it might have been like negative in a sort of a sort of it might have been negative, but at the same time it probably wasn't working down there anyway. And I was at a job picking apples. It was too hard. It wasn't really going anywhere. Wasn't that beneficial here now that this has happened. I'll get more. I'm going to get more help through the pension to get put back into work. So I'm probably going to get more assistance with a proper long sustaining job that I would have before. So just like all those opportunities that I never had before, especially the pension card, cheap, and all these kind of things, I was just doing it so hard. Now, probably I'm getting more time to rest a lot more and think about a better future and more opportunities through funding for job network agencies. I'm going to take advantage of more doorways. My. I've been open after the pain's done and everything's finished. There might be more opportunities. So the cups full, I like half full. And before when I was earning extra money, I seem to have more now than I had then. There are more bills. There's more everything. All these things that like I'm I'm noticing and I'm going to take full advantage of it. This place helps a lot too. So every every little thing is going to add up to better than it was before because I've got the opportunities. Before I had to do everything myself. And you get stuck. And one job that's going nowhere, but you can't leave it because you need the money. And you're stuck into a Groundhog Day with someone that's not really working at all. And a job that's not really good for you. That's going to all change now. So even though things are going to be like on a budget at the moment, there's lots of silver linings, lots of opportunities coming. There really is. I'll be taking advantage of it. And tell us a bit. How did you find out about Orange Sky? And how do you. I used to live here last time at the road at Oxi Lodge. And I just used to walk past and just. See them. And there's the washing machines that they're always breaking down. It's one minute they're working, next minute they're not. So it's just like, oh, they do washing down the road. So I just come through that word of mouth and just seeing the washing machines. You can just see the people here. Like I said, it's on my morning walk as well. So I can't help not see it. And what's how do you feel about coming and what's it what's it feel like here? Yeah, that's it's one of the like it's an everyday thing. I'm taking a walk every day even though it's only here Monday, Wednesday and Friday. But this is definitely a stop. It wasn't about the breakfast, but like that's that's really good. And it worked into the budget. It's really good. You really notice it at the end of the fortnight. And like I said, it's just good to have a chat sometimes. So to get to know the people here now, it's pretty good. It's like a good it's I've got a routine and routine saves you at the end of the day. And this is a real good one for me, even though I'm not really destitute. But like I'm on a tight budget, though, and it really does help. What's it what do you feel like the impact is of Iron Sky for all the people that come? Like how do you how do you think that changes? I see a lot of people that come here that really need the food and the washing machines, but they really need they really need both, I think, because they wouldn't come here with the washing. They wouldn't be a lot of them wouldn't be like as clean and as hygienic as they would be if they didn't need to have something to eat. It just also helps them come here and they just say, oh, well, I might as well bring the clothes as well. And that does it. I think it does. It does a big thing for hygiene, for lots of things, for health, because they push since COVID they've been pushing the hygiene thing and people do do that. I do see them using the sand sanitizers and taking them as well. I think the cleanliness thing, because like if they're hungry, it's not too much just to bring the washing as well. I might as well bring the washing too, whereas if they wouldn't have been washing the clothes, I'm telling you right now. And what about the connection and the conversation and like all the stuff that provides people? That's the other thing that does it too. I think that's why, like I said, it keeps going back to the functionality of the person because they have a yarn and they have a chat and that's why they don't mind staying here with the washing because then they have another coffee and it's just like it's a breakfast table and it keeps them here. So that no one minds waiting for the clothes to wash. And I think it's a big plus, the hygiene factor and the routine is a big plus, I think. So awesome. And what's next for you? What's for you the next part of life or? Just get back into the business. Just get back into the workforce. I've got like irons in the fire with the job agency I still go to even though I'm not signed off for work at the moment. But Borthwick's Meatworks are behind people that are recovering from injuries and stuff like that. So the meat works, there's a few like irons in the fire where I'm signed off and able to work that I'll get the funding that I need for my job agency through being hurt basically. Like I said about the opportunities and then I'll be working soon. I'm picking it up. I'll be working within the next, I don't know, a year or two. I think I'll be working in the next, by Christmas. Yeah, it's probably another four months in the shoulder fully before I'm really better. But apart from that, I think I'll be working soon. Awesome. All right, we're just going to do a few pickies now, that's all right?\n",

      "Transcript": "A mic test, does it work? Yeah it works. Okay, see? I can feel it. Um, let's see if this works too. It's not too bad. Righto brother, you looking me? Yeah. Tell me your name, and you spell it for me, it'd be great. My name's AJ. It's basically A-J. Bailey, B-A-I-L-L-I-E. Cool man. Tell us a little bit about yourself AJ. Um, about nine years ago I was down in St. Pat's as a street person. And I was staying at St. Pat's and I used Iron Sky for two weeks. And I loved it, I loved the service. So I basically asked Helen, the team leader at the time, can I join the team? And she said yes. And I wrote my way up to team leader. Today. Today? Yeah. And I was general volunteer, assistant team leader, and team leader. But I do two shifts. I do one shift here on Sunday, and I do another shift at Gosnell's on Wednesday. With the shower truck, Carla. What's, um, tell us about your job? Tell us, I don't know where to start. Tell us where, how you heard about Iron Sky when you were doing it right. Well, basically on the streets, word by mouth. Yeah. They normally come down, people talk, um, where it goes around and yeah. It's great. What's your, like, do you have a particular story you like to tell around your journey to homelessness? Or what's your... Well... Basically... I came out of prison. Um, I ended up with a, well, my lady, my late partner, she passed away from cancer. Um, liver, cirrhosis of liver. And I was on the streets in Northridge. And I went to Rua, and they got me into accommodation down St Pat's. And, yeah. I've been there for about two, two years. What's it feel like to go from using it to being a supporter of Iron Sky? I love it. I love giving it back to the community. Yeah. Like, I love it down here because everyone knows me and I know them. Yeah. What's it feel like to know people who are still doing it tough and you sort of in this role here? How's that feel to you and your relationships with people? Well, it's pretty good. People come up to me and say, hey, Jay, I'm looking for accommodation and I check on, um, I don't know if you know an app called ArcCity. I use that quite a lot. Last year, I saved somebody's life because he was on the street. Um, he wanted to commit suicide. Jump off a building in Perth City. And I was... And some strange reason, he came straight up to me and I gave him help. I talked to him. I rang up the EMBOs and they were getting help in a mental hospital. What do you think the power of Impact of Iron Sky is as a person who... It's pretty good. You're like, I see people's faces with a big smile on their face. Um, they did have a shower down here. But, yeah, when they come down with their dirty clothes, they're nice. They love us doing their job. So, I've got a... I had one friend down here. His jumper was pretty wet. So he asked me, can I put in a dryer? So I did put in a dryer. And I guarantee he'll be smiling as soon as he gets his warm jumper. Because of this fella. And yeah, I love it. I love doing this, um, position. I'm not a, um, bad boss. I'm a good person in charge. My team knows what they're doing. All I do is just sit, stand back and... Last year I had a couple living in the car. And the lady got in the car. And the lady, Kirsty, she came up to me. A friend. I haven't seen her for... For ages. And she says, AJ, I'm staying in the car with my fella. Can we do a washing? And I said, yeah, yeah, true. So I was. So once we'd done their washing, three days. They loved it. Yeah. Wow. What's, um, we talk about this idea of friends. There's a podcast now called At The Aquas. It's called Orange Sky Deep. It's called, um, about friends and friendship. What do you think of that word friends when it comes to your own friends and Orange Sky? Yeah. I feel, um, well, I've got friends. And then I've got friends down here. Well, I've got two different sorts. Like, I've got friends, like, um, bad side. And I've got friends down here. So, yeah. I keep that stuff away from Orange Sky. Because it... What do you think the power of friendship is? Like, what do your friends that are close to you do for you in terms of your mental health and support? Well, they, like, check on me. They're saying if I'm okay. Like, last couple of weeks ago, I had passed a first aid certificate. And ever since then, we've got a friend that always has a heart attack down here. So I'm the one that helps. So, yeah. And, um, if you don't know me, I'm a friend of the friends. And, um, I'm a friend of the friends. So I've got a friend that's a friend of the friends. And I'm a friend of the friends. And I've got a friend that's a friend of the friends. And I've got a friend that's a friend of the friends. So I'm the one that rings up the EMBOs saying, are you okay, check on him, wait for the EMBOs to come down, and, yeah. Wow. That's so good, mate. Um, how do you... What do you think should happen in the city of Perth around supporting people who think this is more... Should it be more in-sky, more furthest? You know, I think it would be better if the people in Perth were more supportive, and more, you know, more... You know, I think there's a lot of good things around the world. So, yeah. So, yeah. So, yeah. You know, I think the, um, I think the first aid certificate is how you have to go about it. It's how you have to go about it. I reckon Basil should pull his finger out his arse, spend money on accommodation for the homeless. And I want to see our own sky like bandit, like more washing machines and more drives. If this thing happens then we can have two more washing machines instead of one. Because every week I have between eight to ten friends come down. I don't like knocking them back. What about people that support our own sky, why do you reckon they should keep supporting our own sky? What's the... What's the power of donating and supporting? Because it's... Our own sky is a really good service. We put clean clothes, showers, we supply showers. Like when I do shift at Gosnell's, people come in and have a shower, they come out with a big smile on their face saying, oh yeah I'm clean. And to me it feels... I feel good inside. Yeah. Because I know what it's like because I've been on the street myself and I see both sides of the fence. Yeah. Yeah, that's super important and quite unique as well I think in terms of what we do. Yeah. Cool man. Is there anything else you wanted to say to our own sky or people around our own sky? No. No? You all good? We're all good. I'm going to try and... Who else should I get to talk?

      "Transcript": "Give it a go. He said it's got adaptive cruise control, it's you know got all this tech in it and man I fell in love with that car. Well I drove from here to Yungle and back and I only had to put my foot on the accelerator and the brake three times. The rest of the time the tech did all the work, it was fantastic. And it had the speed sign monitoring in it so as we were going up the hill it was taking the 20k bends, the 30k bends without me having to put my feet on the on the pedals. I just sat there and steered it was awesome. Righto brother we're gonna rock on. All we're gonna do you're gonna talk to me. This is gonna be a conversation, if you don't have hands enough with something that's fine I'll cut and edit it so. That's all good. You can even tell me whatever. So what we'll do is start with your name so if you just do your full name and if you can spell it for us that would be amazing. My name is Michael Young, M-I-C-H-A-E-L-Y-O-U-N-G. My nickname is Bear because everywhere I go there are plenty of Mikes, Micks and being a being a little fella, Bear just seemed appropriate. I've had that nickname pretty much most of my life. Tell us a little bit about the Bear story, where do you where do you want to start and have your childhood based family now? Good morning everyone, my name is Michael Young and I was born and raised in New South Wales. I'm her dad. I'm 21 so I don't have an opportunity to talk if I'm doing well or not, it's unfortunate but I did have a family generations background upon you and I'm still very happy to be with you. My dad moved out of Australia to a country called commercial agriculture a couple of years ago in 1916!!! So what's your background up to her fact books for a household. My dad's life started in the short time he slot ladies at home so he thought He actually orchestrated my career at sea, which was interesting, because he brought us up to be very independent. And when I left home, which was my fault, and I freely admit that, he said, if you want to live under my roof, you live under my rules. And I went, fair enough, packed my bag that day and moved out. And got myself a job as a delivery boy in Sydney. This was back in the late 70s. Met a guy at one of the pubs, because I was very tall at 16. Met a guy at the pub, he was the secretary of the seamen union, and he got me a way to sea. I found out 10 years later that Taffy Sweetinson knew my dad. And dad had said to him, oh, listen, my son's up there, can you see what you can do for it? But because of that, I got to travel the world. Best thing that ever happened. And I have, because of the work ethic that my father gave me, I got to go to places that I never would have gone. Because I, the way the registry worked was that the first 50 people got the chance of taking a job or not. And then they'd throw it open to anyone. And then if the job was still vacant, then the first person had to take it. So I was always there to see what jobs were going. When I was on leave, because I hated staying in the one place. And I got to go to amazing places. I was in Berlin when the wall fell. I got to do six months in Antarctica on a research ship because no one knew what the ship was about. And I just put my hand up and said, yeah, I'll take it. Fast forward, wound up leaving the merchant. Wound up as learning how to cook. Did an apprenticeship. I was a chef. I was a chef. I was a chef. I was a chef through a friend of mine who had one of the first Australian restaurants. Indigenous themed restaurants, push foods in Hornsby. Wound up with my own cafe. Did that for six years. Did well out of that. Went to the Gold Coast. Fell in love with it and spent 23 years there. Sold up down south. And then got married. Didn't have a family, but it came. It came with a stepson. Then in 2005, my life changed. I went from having a good career, plenty of money and that, got run over by a concrete truck on a building site, wound up with this nerve damage, made the mistake of suing my employer, got blacklisted from the construction industry because of that because he wants to employ someone who successfully sued his employer. And got addicted to prescription drugs to the point where I was suicidally depressed, pushed my wife away, pushed all my friends away. My dad had a stroke, so my mum asked me to come up and help give her a break. So I did that, but I was still addicted to the prescription meds. And that really messed with my head. When my father died, and he slowly starved himself to death because his dementia said that he could swallow tablets and coffee, but he couldn't eat food, and he'd chew and spit his food. So I watched him slowly waste away over nearly eight years. And when dad died, I just lost the plot. I didn't care anymore. That's how I wound up in the system here. And when I first came to Mackay, I was... I was still a... Not quite a mess, but almost a mess. I tried hiding in the bush for 11 months. And I learned that you can't hide from your demons because they follow you. I got into the hostel system down in Bundaberg, and that helped a lot. But it was when I got here, I got the opportunity to move into a transition house just down the road. And I started coming here to do my washing. And Lisa and the other volunteers here, were always welcoming. They were always someone who would listen to me. And I was able to talk a lot of my demons out of me because of that. Apart from being able to do my washing, it was the companionship. It was the... You know, they helped me get my mental health together to the point where I'm a lot more positive about life. And, you know, I... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... What's the word? The... The... The... The... The... Comraderyship. The... The socialization. Because when I first came here, I was very quiet and... Too much in my head. And... It was through the volunteers here that they... They got me out of my head. And... Once I was out of my head, the demons started... Going. Because all I did was I was in this mental loop... Where I didn't know what I was doing. or where I was going or... Yeah, I thought when my dad died that we'd said everything we needed to say, but I was only kidding myself because that's all I thought about was dad wasting away and what's the point of anything and... Yeah. But that's my story in a nutshell. Mate, you pretty much answered all of my questions in that. Yeah, it's incredible the way in which you were able to explain that journey, like a hero's journey type story. One thing that stood out, I guess, was you said the system. Can you talk a little bit more about what the system feels like to you? Well, I'm talking about the social system. St Vinny's, the hostels, the social workers, who are in the hostels, they helped me to talk all this stuff out. So I was sort of semi-socialised by the time I got to the transition house, which was around in Keats Street, and because it was so close and I... Every time I went to do my washing at the house, it was either raining or someone was using it because I was sharing with a number of people. And then I found Orange Sky. And once I started doing my washing here, everyone was so welcoming that I just wanted to keep coming back. It was awesome because rather than just sitting at where I was living, trying to distract myself with TV or YouTube or... And even my YouTube was just remembering my old life. That is no more. So I was still stuck in that loop of what I've lost, not what my life is. Not what my life could be. And it was through Lisa mainly who kept helping. And yeah, so... Yeah, without Lisa and the other volunteers here, I'd still be stuck in the past. And that was something I just could not get away from. I thought I had it all under control, but looking back at it now, and even though I'm still a YouTube addict and I love my four-wheel drive, so... And all that sort of stuff. It's... It's just entertainment now, whereas before I would remember what I'd lost. Sometimes it's hard to talk about impact with Orange Sky. Like, I guess some people think it's just washing or just conversation. No, no, it's... It's not... It's... Coming to a place where people care. And they genuinely care. They're not doing it because they're paid, which, as much as the social workers at Vinnie's helped, it's their job. Orange Sky are volunteers. They care because they care, not because they're paid to care. And that is a huge difference. Even... It's such a simple thing. As one of the volunteers who comes, she's got a sewing room at home. And... Because I live with clothes until there's... You know, they fall off. I'm a big guy. Finding clothes is always challenging. Some of my boxers and shorts and that were starting to come adrift at the seams. And Vicky took them home, sewed them up for me and brought them back. Now that, to me, was worth more than anything. Yeah. The fact that someone cared enough to do that for me and do it joyously was awesome. Yeah. It made me realise that I'm not alone, that people do care, not just say they care. And that's what this place is all about. They put their caring into action, not just words. It's easy if you've got money to donate to a charity. I used to do it. Did I really care? Eh. It made me feel good. I could say, oh yes, I donate $100 a month to charities. But did I really care? It was just money. When I first started coming here, I valued this so much that I used to help set up. My legs weren't quite as bad as they are now. Yeah. And that's where I am going up and down stairs. My knees are shot now. But I did it because I wanted to give back, to say thank you, and not just in words. And even now, when they set up in the morning, there's always one or two of us that will help with whatever needs to be done, even if it's such a simple thing as carrying the sign out the front for them. And that's what I did. And even now, when they set up in the morning, there's always one or two of us that will help with whatever needs to be done, even if it's such a simple thing as carrying the sign out the front for them. And I'm really, really grateful to them. Yeah. And, yeah, it gives us, it sounds cliché, but it actually gives us dignity here. Whereas everywhere else, if you're poor, homeless, living in housing, you're treated like a second class citizen by most people. They judge you by how you look. Yeah. As somebody with a disability, you realise how uncaring the world is. And mine's physical, not just mental. So, you know, for people who don't have obvious damage, it's a very uncaring world out there. And it's places and organisations like here that make a huge difference to us. You touched a little bit on, I think, the fact that you're not a person who's a person of colour. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. You touched a little bit on, I suppose, these things of isolation and being by yourself. And I guess, you categorised maybe loneliness in there. What's, like, at a macro, broader perspective, what do you think that does to society when people feel that way on scale? And how does Orange State help with that? When you're lonely, you feel forgotten. And when you feel forgotten, you stop caring about yourself, your situation. It's really easy to, you know, fall back on alcohol, drugs, all that sort of, whether it's illegal or prescription, it makes no difference. And it also doesn't help that the medical system is so happy to pump you full of prescription medication, to make you feel better. But they're just doing a job. You know, they, it's when you come to a place like this that you realise that people do actually care about you. They don't judge you. They don't, I'm not even sure what the word for it is, but yeah, it's this lack of judgement. If you fall down, they don't give you a hard time over it. They judge you. They just reach out and say, how can we help? And that gives you a bit of self-worth and slowly brings you back to, you know, how you were before your journey started. You know, I say to people that you're six poor decisions away from winding up here. And it's really easy to make those six decisions when your life isn't going well. And then they compound. And then suddenly you're there going, wow, how did I get here? And yes, there are circumstances, but you know, people have family members who die and they don't fall apart. You know, people have accidents, but their life doesn't fall apart. But it's the combination of one hit after another. And then you start making, once you make that first poor decision, it's really easy to make more poor decisions. And it's through here that they help me start making good decisions because they care. I've only got one more question because you've been so rad, I'm going to run out of time. What's next for you, I guess? And then what impact does the next have? What does Orange Sky have on that next? Like what do you hope is next? Well, that's a hard question to ask. I'm looking for more stable accommodation. That's flat. It's my knees are shot. I'm hoping my knees are going to recover. I've found a molecular supplement that should help. It's just a bit hexy. But again, this is where it comes back to Orange Sky. Because of Orange Sky and the other people who help out here, like Phoenix House with breakfasts and the brekkie van with a sausage and egg. That's allowed me to use what's left of my pension because I lose half my pension in rent and power. What's left, I've been working on debt reduction because I managed to, when I didn't care, I just racked up bills. And rather than going bankrupt, I chose to pay all that off. So I've tapped into all the charity systems in Mackay, which are fantastic, but predominantly here. I'm at the stage where I'm now at the point where I can afford the medication that, well, I don't like to call it medication because technically it's a supplement, but I'll be able to afford to use that, which I'm hoping will help rebuild the cartilage in my knees. And just get me generally better in health. So that's sort of my plan for the next year is to try and get my health together. I'll still come here because this is the one place that I feel safe. I feel wanted. And it's somewhere where if I want to socialise, I can. If I don't want to socialise, I don't have to. And people will be there for me. I'll be friendly or not, depending on how you react to their friendliness. And that's rare because there's nothing worse when you're feeling down than having someone come up all the time going, are you okay? Yeah, they want to fix you. And sometimes you don't need to be fixed. You just need to be able to vent. Because how are you going to work your demons out if someone else is trying to fix you? The only person who can fix you, is you. That's what this place allows me to do. Yeah, apart from being able to do my washing and all the physical stuff. It's having caring people. That's a good way to end it, I reckon. Well done. Alright.\n",

Actually more the BCF type stores. Oh BCF. Classic. Cool, so you just look at me, don't worry about this thing. Ready to go. So I'm just going to move it around a bit. Awesome. Yeah, so all you've got to do is say your name and spell it for me first off. So it's Jenny, J-E-N-N-I. Cool, last name? Calcraft, C-A-L-C-R-A-F-T. So Calcraft, like arts and craft. Oh, amazing. So I usually just do a little bit of like how you want to introduce yourself or like do identify a particular way or anything. So tell me a little bit about who you are and like where you're from maybe. My name is Jenny. I grew up in Brisbane, but now live and work on Orpheus or Gullbody Island. I'm the station manager at Orpheus Island Research Station, which is owned by JCU, James Cook University. And yeah, I'm a marine biologist and lover of the ocean. Amazing. Tell us a little bit about where we are and why we're here. So we're here at East Palm Island at a quite culturally significant site for the Munbarra people of Palm Island. We're here today to collect some evidence for Native Land Title and also as a storytelling opportunity. Amazing. Tell me a little bit about it then. What's the story? Well, it's not actually really my story to tell. It's for the people on this boat to tell. I'm here as a facilitator. My skill is in the water and facilitating ocean type activities so I've got my underwater camera and I suppose that my part of this story is that we have a lot of collaboration with Marneborough and involving us with this story means that we're a little bit part of it. I won't go into it too much, but essentially there's some quite large rocks here, which there's some storytelling that you'll hear a little bit more about in regards to them being three sisters. So we've got two ladies that are in the ranger the ranger group um page who just graduated and was in the at sims jcu at sims program so aboriginals and torres strait islanders and marine science and then we've also got natalie who is a senior ranger and she's a lady and then also myself who is also a ocean lady um so it was it was a little bit i think serendipitous for us to sort of come here today with such great weather um and all three of us ladies be able to get into a space which is you know women's only in in the water itself so there's quite a lot of storytelling around this which i i don't yeah i won't go into it a little bit more but that's essentially the premise of it so I've got sort of multiple programs and multiple institutions that are sort of coming together and trying to tell this story. Rich gave me a little bit of insight and there's a bit of a theme around women in water. Tell me a little bit more about that as it relates to like how you feel being part of this and what do you think? Oh yeah, a lot of us including myself are really passionate about getting women and especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women into marine science. I think it's really powerful to have a a woman at the research station who's the manager and we're really keen to facilitate more people sort of coming up through the ranks and stepping into these sorts of positions in some capacity whether that's in a management role or a support role, aquaculture, some sort of marine science research yeah. There's a pretty low percentage of First Nations people that go down the marine science and then even less that go down the marine science path that identifies a woman. So that's something that we really want to upskill people and sort of bring them through the ranks to go forth and increase diversity and and representation and it's really important to be able to see people's people in these roles so that you have something to aspire towards and grow towards and you you have mentors and and that's also a little bit of what we're doing today is creating these partnerships and trying to connect on sea country. So cool. How does it feel down there? What's the feel to you to be down there? It was quite warm today so it was really nice and cool to just get in the water. We had a little trouble finding the site itself and we went down and it was a bit of a swim out and we had to reset so we were already a little bit puff, which is why we needed a little bit of a break. But once we got down there and set the site up, it's pretty amazing. There's some quite significant large rocks, which represents the three sisters and that whole story. So it's really cool to see that and see how much growth there is on there. to see that and see how much growth there is on there. Saw quite a lot of fish life and different species of coral in that little space there. And there's not actually that much around, so it's pretty interesting just sort of geographically and in terms of like what's actually happened here and why is there this little pinnacle of like three quite distinct rocks just in, you know, sticking out of the water or quite close to the water yeah um last question um what um what do you hope sort of um happens um from this today like what do you hope the next stages are and anything that can be over say the one um i'd really like to see our relationship with Munbra and Boogerman on Palm Island grow more in whatever capacity they want to grow that. So that might be some more schools participating in the At Sims program and bringing these young people through that program and then you know, hopefully ending up at JCU or just pursuing further education. There's a lot of talk of this education space on Palm Island and I think it makes a lot of sense to be able to partner with an institution like JCU to be able to start to build that pathway and I think all of these sort of stakeholders are really part of that story.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "I don't understand where we're coming from or what we're trying to achieve. To be taken seriously as an oyster farmer or commercial operator nowadays, you can't stay stagnant—you have to put yourself in a position where they can't question your standing. It doesn't change who I am as a person; to them, I've just got a title now and they see me as a commercial Black face they can tick off their box. But don't forget about the rest of the bay. We might have an agreement to farm these two areas with their support and funding, but we're going to take back the whole bay. We're not going to stop there—we're going to take it all, and they're going to support us. That's how I see this project developing over the next 10–20 years.\nWith that position as a commercial operator, and with the support of my elders and people like Ben, we're leading these initiatives not just for Fisher's Oysters, but for the next generation of the whole community. I don't think any other First Nations farmers have been operating with that mindset or approach of really challenging what these fellows are trying to dictate.\nHopefully, we can tap into the existing energy—if you think about the elders as a whole and the progress they want to see happen, everyone's lifting each other up. If we can own that narrative, it's such a powerful case study. I'm on the board of the Food Connect Shed, and they've got a Food Connect Foundation with a big Olympics push around farm-to-plate, aiming for 100%. That's following the same approach. The opportunity is there, and the timing is ideal.\nThe challenge is making sure we're owning the narrative and those spaces where they're talking. They've got this massive Olympic committee with people coming through, but they can't even decide where to put a stadium—they're so far from having these conversations the right way. But I think we can get ahead of the game with the narrative. That's where we're setting the foundation right for our young ones. Everything will be laid out for them. They just need to show up and won't have to feel the pressure we've had to deal with. The barriers for our mob to get a lease are tough because we can't compete, but I think the community approach will really start to show some big things.\nHow many leases are available now on the island? Well, it's not like they've got them listed on Facebook Marketplace or anything—it's quite a process. It's not up to you; it depends on how much money you've got. These farmers can see they're starting to capitalize off the bay. A lease out here that my mate bought for $3,000 is now going for $20,000. That's just for a bare lease—if it's fully operational at commercial scale, it could be up to $100,000.\nThey're not looking at growing capacity; they're just looking at profit. I know farmers here who have bought farms but are only working one. One guy in particular—he's a friend of mine—purchased all the banks up in Bribie, one down in Pimpama, and about four in Moreton. I think there's about six up in Bribie, four up here in Moreton, and another one down there—like ten leases, but he's only working one or two. They're packaging all these things up to go to the highest bidder—it's like land banking.\nThat's what these fellows have been doing for quite some time. I was able to secure a few cheaper ones before prices went up too much. I got two really good leases to build momentum. It's about trying to snap up those deals before they get out of reach. This is about building up our own economic health and support. For me and my family, it's about getting into a position where we can create generational wealth and not feel like we're getting hunted off these oyster leases. That's how it was for us growing up—we'd go out on these oyster leases and get chased off them. I was chased off one the other day, pretty much. My neighbor, an oyster farmer, said, \"You just stay on your lease and I'll stay on mine.\" That shows how embedded this mindset is with these people—they're so stuck in their ways.\nWe're trying to move forward together—there are some good people who want to work together. They've got the Queensland Oyster Growers Association, and then Australia's got their own association as well. Ben and I have been talking about a First Nations Oyster Growers Association for the whole state. It would be awesome to have Richard involved in that kind of initiative. We're advocating for mob and creating these pathways, understanding the system well, and challenging it effectively to achieve our outcomes.\nWhen you've got those associations, you can start pushing for funding. Without those structures, you miss opportunities. It's like Brody up in Mount Isa who runs Camping on Country and gyms—he's got everything needed to succeed but doesn't have a governance board or big organization, while all the established organizations there just get funding and buy cars. He's doing the actual work but struggling for support. We've started getting him some backing, but it's frustrating that you need these Western frameworks when the community structure is already there with elder support.\nThat's similar to our situation, but our elders have their not-for-profit company with DGR status, which means they can access bigger funding packages. For us, we could just operate Fisher's Oysters comfortably as a Black business, but it's far bigger than that—it's about the work I want to contribute to and knowing when to bring modern approaches.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Linda Pietri\n\n[00:00:00] Do you want? No, you're fine with the orange sky. Oh, mech on. I'm not, um, I very much love it when it's not planned. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's hard to be natural though, isn't it? You know, it's, yeah. It's tricky. Well, what we'll do, yeah. Is um, let's do our best. We have a conversation, so I'll sit here. Yeah. So you don't have to worry about this.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. From my eye line as well. That's, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Uh, cool. So, um, just your full name and spell it would be awesome. Okay. So Linda Pietri, P-I-E-T-R-I-S. Linda, with an I. Yep. Uh, let's start with a little bit about yourself first. Yes. Tell me a little about yourself. Um, well, in another life I was a midwife.\n\nSo a lot of years in that business and [00:01:00] um, yeah, was doing a hybrid volunteering slash midwifery thing and then retired for whatever reason. And now I probably do more hours volunteering than I did working as a nurse. So, yeah. And uh, I was. Probably five years ago drawn to the orange sky thing and having two 20 something sons, you know, the two boys were on my radar and yeah.\n\nYeah, it's good. And I liked the whole idea. I, I think was great. And the fact that they ran with the idea I thought was even better, so, yeah. Yeah, that's good. My, um, my wife is a midwife. Oh, is she? Yeah. She's, it's a great job now. Um, she's now doing diabetes education. Oh yeah. It's a bit more, uh, user friendly, [00:02:00] our probably, yeah.\n\nYeah. Good. Sure. It's a great job though. Um, how did you first hear about onco? I think I always, because I've had an involvement with volunteering and that sort of thing, I've always been interested in what's going on for. People that need it. And I think when they were made young Australians of the year, that really got them on my radar.\n\nUm, and then I live near where the base is, where Splasher lives in Norwood. So I used to see the van a bit. Yeah. And then one day I just said, oh, look that up and see what's going on. And here we are. Um, what is it that. Almost has kept you around though. What are the things that keep you coming back to do this stuff?\n\nUm, I guess you can take the girl outta nursing, but you can't take the nursing out of the girl. [00:03:00] And so helping people's just in my DNA, I think got no other. Yeah, I just really enjoy that I get a kick out of. Doing the right thing. Well, like you saw then I just sort of ran into Morgan today unexpectedly.\n\nWell, I have been working in the background trying to get her a phone for a couple of weeks and, um, that's come to fruition, so she'll be happy with that. Yeah. Have a little chat with Morgan. Like, I think super interesting to, um, understand different people's cons, like, um, yeah, concepts of homelessness slash.\n\nWhy they use these things. She talked about her clothes getting ruined by dryer and stuff and in the van. Yeah. That's surprised me. I don't know. Yeah. Um, what's it, I guess, um, can you tell me a little bit about your relationship with Morgan and friends and things like, how does that work so well, Morgan [00:04:00] just is here when I get here every Monday.\n\nI mean those clothes she was washing today, I think she only washed them on one day. So I think it gives her something to do and a reason to, 'cause she's where she's staying is, well, you were there today, Elle. It's not close. So it's an all day job getting here really. And washing and getting back. Um, but I guess it gives her a reason to get up in the morning and come over here relatively comfortable, quiet.\n\nShe can charge her fine. If she's got one, she can sit here and tidy up her belongings and. Um, but yeah, she chooses to come up here and like she's told you, she goes to the airport for a shower. So that's another hike and a half over there. Um, I'd like to see Morgan get a house and a job. Maybe she feels, she like, she's pretty stable.\n\nShe's got mental illness. Did she tell you that she's bipolar? So she had an episode at work, lost her job. She's estranged from her family. I don't really [00:05:00] know the story behind that. No. No marriage or children that I can get out of her. Um, yeah, we chat, you know, just every week. I think she's pretty well the meds are working, put it that way.\n\n'cause she's pretty even compared to what a lot of people that rock up. And what do you think her reality is in terms of day to day, in terms of like where she stays and that sort of thing? Well, she was living in her car. Did she tell you this? So she was living in her car, but her car and her phone was stolen, so that means she's now sleeping rough.\n\nShe's been lucky with the weather 'cause it hasn't rained here in months. Um, and then, yeah, she's just out in the opening Glendale. 'cause she finds that safer than other places. But that's not, it's not a long term solution, is it? Mm-hmm. And I just think finding a job or a fine or a place to live is impossible [00:06:00] without a fine.\n\nSo she's gotta get that sorted. So, yeah. Um, but she's, yeah, she's, she seems pretty normal, whatever that is. Yeah. Yeah. We, you wouldn't pick her as homeless if you saw her in the street. Um, she's always got shiny shoes, clean clothes, so. Presenting herself well is a big part of what she is, I think. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI sort of sit down at the yarn and she was sort of like, I'd love to do that, but I've achieved something, is the way she'd put it. Ah. So, yeah. Interesting to see like, yeah. People's level of interests or motivation. Yeah. Yeah. She, I mean, she has never come in here seeming sad or angry to me. And there are others that rock up that have different moods every time you see them, but she's very, even, you know what you're gonna get.[00:07:00] \n\nUm, she's never pushy. She's no one, you know, people will jump up and down if they can't get her washer straight away. She's not that person at all. She's very calm. Yeah. Yeah. I really. You know, I really like her and I'm probably more inclined to help people that don't jump up and down. Yeah. You know that feeling if they're not pushing her, you sort of Yeah.\n\nReally will go outta your way for them. Yeah. Um, um, tell us a little bit the concept of the laundry here. How much do you know about the, when I start of the concept? So this has always been a laundromat. In fact, clients or friends have told me that in the early days and I didn't know. It used to be a laundromat on the top and a nightclub downstairs.\n\nSo go figure. Cool. Can't imagine what was going on. So anyway, I think Orange sky start took it over as a bit of a experiment, I think, to see if. A, it [00:08:00] could be revenue neutral, self-funding, or maybe even raise a bit of money. And I don't, I'm not privy to that information. I have asked whether that happens.\n\nUm, so all these people that live around here in apartments can rock up here and just use it like a normal laundromat pay with their credit card. We used to be open 24 7 for a while. There were people. Sleeping in here and stuff, and I didn't mind. That's fine. But then it got a bit ugly and walls were being kicked in and there was drug stuff everywhere and it got a bit dangerous.\n\nSo we ended up having to shut it at night, which is pretty unfortunate. So the first three, probably two years open, 24 7. Okay. Everything working gradually, we've had to, yeah, wind it back a bit. We've had about. Oh, [00:09:00] 15 fire extinguishers stole. We just, I almost felt like, let's just put it on the footpath because every day I would come in and now it's a real talking point.\n\nThere's one guy that's been coming for ages and every Monday he goes, oh, the fire extinguishers still here. 'cause we've got a lot covered. Someone has tried to force it open, but so yeah. You know, it's like anything, so I don't know. I think it's it. Morgan was able to come today 'cause last Monday I rang and got her a code that she could use some other time 'cause she hasn't got a phone.\n\nShe can't ring. So, um, that's must have been what she used today. But normally she comes Monday 'cause we are here to do it for her and a lot of other people do that too. And we've just started a shift on Thursdays as well, which took a little while to get off the ground, but I think that's busy as well.\n\nOver the back of that park is a social [00:10:00] housing group of flats with a couple of hundred flats. So we get a lot of those dudes coming over. And what's, what's, how does it work, I guess? Like, can you explain how so it works? Um, you mean just physically? How does it work? Well, yeah. Like what's, what's the idea?\n\nLike what. Do you tell people in terms of the pre and the paper? So free is just, I have a code I can use. Instead of them scanning their card, I punch in the code and it's all taken care of. Mm-hmm. And I don't ask any questions. Some people rock up in their fancy cars and tell me they want it for free. Oh yeah.\n\nWhatever. But the paid is. Six or $7 a load, which A probably pays for the electricity and water. B maybe funds orange sky in other ways, not sure. [00:11:00] Um, that's I think, the plan, but no one has ever told us if that happens. I have asked, but never got that information. Cool. So it's a great idea. Um, and people love the idea and people sometimes that come on a Monday night realizing it's free, then say to me, well, so how can I donate then if you've done it for free?\n\nSo that's really great if they think along those lines. Um, I think it's a really good concept and I think the fact that people don't have to. Meet the van at a certain place for a certain time. Yeah. And also the fact that with six washers, six dryers, we can get through a ton of washing really. So it's, yeah, it's good.\n\nIt works well. What's, what's the shifts like in terms of like people hanging around and talking? Do they drop and leave? What's the, it comes and goes a bit, yeah, a bit of [00:12:00] both. Um, which is good 'cause it gets pretty crowded if everyone stays close. Um. We have, we have had over the couple of years, such a variety of people that wanna either do wanna come and chat, or people that just want you to do their washing and then they wanna bugger off somewhere and come back later.\n\nIt's, yeah, look, it's, there's such a huge variety, but it's busy with Mondays, we are doing 16, 18 loads of washing in the two hours, so that's pretty. Pretty full on. That's, uh, I don't think we could do much more, actually.\n\nUm, what's your sort of concept of, in general, in terms of like the, what do you, everyone has a different concept of what impact it has, like the laundry, the conversations, connections, volunteers. What in your own sort of [00:13:00] mind do you think the.\n\nUm, I think the impact is different for everyone and everyone's looking for something different. For some people, it is about the clean clothes, and that is a big deal really when you think about it. Some people like the chat, some people don't. I've had a guy that I recognized from here. Down in the park.\n\nOne day when I was down there doing my exercises, he was trying to charge his phone on the barbecue and I said, Hey Andy, you know up the road, you can charge it in the laundromat for free. And he goes. Yeah, but don't go there Mondays between two and four. 'cause the fuckers wanna talk to you. And I'm like, okay, no worries.\n\nWell you don't have to go in those hours, go anytime. Yeah. Yeah. So not everyone wants the chat. You know? Some people seriously do not want the chat. Yeah. [00:14:00] But it's different for everyone, you know. And what about volunteer wise? Like why do you think volunteers in general can.\n\nYeah, I dunno. I think some people just wanna be busy. Some people really do embrace the concept and like the involvement with people and the feeling that they're helping people. But um, and everyone's kind of got an interest, haven't they? Because we're all just one bad decision away from being our. We friends.\n\nMm-hmm. So, um, yeah, and we've all seen those guys. You know, I think I was telling Nick in the podcast, I used to have a regular girl who was the lead violinist with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and you know, a couple of bad years, life goes to shit. Bad partner, a few drugs, [00:15:00] gets bit mental illness, life's just upside down.\n\nAnd I don't think really. That she was ever going back to. She was poached to London. She had a huge musical career, but so everyone's come from somewhere different. Some people just are from families that don't know that full-time work exists and other people have had a whole other life and it's just gone a bit bad.\n\nAnd then we get, actually we've got, had a few people over the years that are, you know, homeless by choice that just like the freedom and don't really want government involvement and happy to just cruise around. Totally. Um, any hope for dreams for this journey? Oh, how long have we got? Well, I do, because I've been here since it [00:16:00] opened.\n\nI feel like it's my baby a bit, and as I said, I'm busting to get a shower, but I would almost settle for a running water and a hand basin, which we don't have. Um. I really like to, it's great that we've got the two shifts. I feel like extended hours have been good. Um, just needs a bit of a tidy up, but actually people don't, no one really comments about the state of the place.\n\nI mean, I might give it a quick vacuum before I go, but not many per it's, it's only when it's been particularly bad, like. I don't know. Sometimes there's, you get here and there'll be pizza boxes and beer cans and stuff everywhere, and no one really wants, no one really finds that environment nice, do they?\n\nYeah, so we try [00:17:00] and keep it nice, but I'm hoping that it's doing well enough that orange sky feels they can keep investing in it and. You know, there's a lot of good about it. I think they really did their homework in placing it here. The free bus from the city comes right across the road, so that's fantastic.\n\nUm, you know, but even if you had to walk, it's not that far. Um, the fact that it's near social housing and it's near a lot of other apartments, I think's a great thing. Businesses in the area use it. We get, you know, hairdressers and restaurants and stuff washing stuff here, so. It's a great, it's a great thing.\n\nYeah. Um, I just think a shower would be fantastic. Yeah. So fun. We'd probably keep it locked unless there were volunteers here, but it'd be great to be able to offer that. And we have water and [00:18:00] electricity. And lots of space behind those walls. So I am thinking it can't be that difficult. If you can put a shower in a van, you can put one here.\n\nSo we've, I know for a fact we've had some pretty sizable donations. Um, a hundred thousand from the Freemasons. I've got the Glenside Lines Club wanting to give us money. The money's around. Well, hopefully this will go a little bit of the way to, ah, I've been nagging Emma for a long time. She knows the who, who's that?\n\nEmma?\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Paul Kayne & Kay Peterson\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAlright. This is excellent. Cool. Are you ready? No. Okay. So do you just have to do your full name and spell it for me first one by one. My name is Paul Kane. KA Paul, KANE. Yeah. And my name is Kay Peterson. K-A-Y-E-P-E-T-E-R-S-O-N. So tell me a little bit about yourself first. I am a retired old lady, a dotting aunt mother of two dogs, born and bred in Hobart, still here.\n\nYeah, ex-teacher, ex librarian. That'll do amazing. What about yourself? I'm a retired technician, electronics technician. I moved to Hobart about eight years ago. I do a lot of bush walking and and things in the bush here. That's about it. How'd you first hear about Orange [00:01:00] Scott? I went looking for volunteer organizations.\n\n'cause I've obviously been retired. It's nice to be able to if you've had a lucky life, like I'd probably count myself as having it's nice to be able to. Do something for people that aren't having such a lucky life. Cool. Yeah. And yourself? Had you heard about Orangeburg? I heard about it oh, 10 years ago when the boys first started out in Queensland, and I thought it was such a great idea.\n\nAnd now that I'm retired, I've got a bit of time and I miss the social aspect, especially being a teacher. When you stop, you miss. Miss that contact. So it's nice to have conversations with everyday people. That's cool. Seems like a really cool vibe here with with the service provider.\n\nWhat's how do you feel about that partnership and how that works? I think that they're highly supportive. Yeah, it's a it's a good relationship between us and them. They keep an eye on us. Just in case things go wrong out [00:02:00] here. No, I think they've been pretty good. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And the team that we work, with's always really lovely too. Like I was a bit apprehensive starting 'cause I'm fairly new, but you just made me feel welcome and there's great rules and good support yeah, it's fabulous. And what was that like starting, what was the process you had to go through to.\n\nGet to your first, it was quite a lot of online information that you had to weed through lots of OC health and safety, which is important, but a passed, and I'm here. They gave me the hat. And what keeps you guys coming back to shifts? What's the main thing that excites you to keep coming back?\n\nI think you build up a relationship with some of the people obviously here. Not so much today because it seems to have changed over. But I enjoy the company of the of everyone on the shift. We got, we've had been very lucky. We've always had lovely people. It's good. What sort of conversations do you have with your [00:03:00] family and friends about Orange sky and volunteering and stuff?\n\nDo people get it or? Interesting my family's been really supportive of it and they knew that I'd do something and I'm glad it's not involving food 'cause I'm not good with food. I can, better with the washing. Some of my friends were a bit surprised. I. They, they wouldn't put themselves in this position they thought, but it's perfect for me.\n\nI like having conversations with interesting people. So perfect for that, isn't it? Absolutely. Yeah. What do you reckon the, from your own perspective, the most important part of it is? Is the washing connecting with people? Is it volunteer stuff? What's. What stands out as the most important part of the year?\n\nI know, I think I think it makes such a genuine difference to people's lives. It's nice to hand over clean clothes, clean, warm clothes to someone that's that, that hasn't got access to, to, washing machines and all the rest of [00:04:00] it. Yeah I think it's a really good little niche in the, in, in this sort of organization.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You can't be, I just think of that night when you jump into bed after you've washed your own sheets, there's nothing better than that feeling. And to be able to share, to give that to someone who can't do it for themselves is great. Yeah. I'd say it makes a big difference to people's minds.\n\nWhen they get nice when they get all their clothes back. Yeah. Because, so sometimes they're a little bit, some of the lights are a little bit ju I'm sure they're glad they're clean afterwards. Yeah. That's cool. Anything that we didn't touch on that you feel is like a cool part of Orange Sky or got any feedback from Nick and Lucas?\n\nOr you wanna talk? Rubbish about general, or I was just so impressed with the the process and the professionalism of it all. It's just amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. No, nothing. It's just [00:05:00] sometimes the new system was very trying for a little while, but, once I timed out, it's fine. It's good.\n\nYeah. Systems are always varied. Implement and yeah. Yeah. I think they're getting close to 3000 volunteers at across Australia. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, some pretty, that was one of the reasons I bounced because it's getting way too big and important for me. Yeah. I'll go back to doing this stuff.\n\nYeah. Good. Cool. Just.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# George Nanganjuan\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAll tell me your full name and spell it first. George and Jewan. So George G-E-O-R-G-E-N-A-N-G-A-N-J-U-A-N. Brad, tell me a little bit about yourself. How do you introduce yourself and background your identity? That my background, so I'm full of Papua New Guinea, but I grew up in Rockhampton. I've been around boys like this my whole life, so that's why get the lingo and stuff like that.\n\nSo that's why I can connect with them a little bit. I'm a simple man, I love my footy, I love my mother. That's basically it. So I appreciate hard work. I'm old school, so I'm not shy at working for my money. I am pretty straightforward. I'm a straight arrow, I like to say, cool, bro. How'd you hear about Young Guns First? My brother actually worked for Young Guns and then I joined up, so I was actually at QUT studying and then I just wanted to make a little bit of extra money on the side, and then I started working at Young Guns and fuck yeah, the boys were great, so I just kept staying back and this is me now, true. Yeah. What's it like working with the fellows coming through this program? The fellows, especially this [00:01:00] program. Oh fuck. I love it. Eh like I said, sorry, I don't know if I say No, it's great. For yourself, like I said I grew up in Rocky, so I've been around these boys all my life, a lot of aboriginal boys, some of my best mates growing up, so I not only I can understand their lingos and stuff like that, I can understand their struggles, what they're going through, what they're coming through. So what I basically wanna do is just create an environment where they, they're welcomed in, where someone can joke with 'em, know their struggles, stuff like that.\n\nMake stuff that makes 'em happy and stuff. But basically, like I said, I understand their struggles and what Kieran was talking about earlier. I just, we want to create good men, not really good workers. So that's the first thing for us. So I just wanna see them succeed. Pretty much, they're all still all young fellas.\n\nAnd seeing them come in that journey, especially like I was saying before about Tyson. Tyson was when he first joined two years ago, is bouncing around to village from village, not really having a home. And then he found himself in my village, my site, and he grew from there and he got attached to each other pretty much.\n\nAnd he's one of my best now. So he's my crew leader as well. [00:02:00] So yeah, that's basically it. What type of work is it? Are they doing? We do a very physical work. So we container unloader, we unload containers for Kmart. So pretty much everything in all the Kmarts in Queensland, my boys probably either touch it or they probably moved it, wrapped it some, so everything that's you see in Kmart, my boys have something to do with it.\n\nSo yeah, we just unload boxes for K month, eight hours, sometimes goes for 10 hours. Boys are straight in containers. Pretty hot yaa, that's, like I said, it creates a. Creates young men, creates a good mental state. I've always said if you can make it in container, you can make it anyway. Which is yeah.\n\nWhat's what's the training and different skills that they're involved in, that sort of stuff? For me, it's all about attitude. What I look for first, when people go, you don't have to be the strongest or the fastest, or it's all by attitude. If you're willing to work, we can wow. We can train that NCO the skills that we need to do with work.\n\nBut it all bus starts if you are want, willing to wanna do it or willing to stay back when it shifts, stuff gets harder, shift gets longer. [00:03:00] It's all by your attitude pretty much. So training, training to do our job, fairly straightforward. We read paperwork, we put boxes on pallets, but it starts off with if you have the right attitude then we can train you.\n\nSo that's basically it, sir. Yeah, we had a little motivational speech in there from Karen and yeah, big stuff. And plan. How do you feel about the next phase and growing and all that kind of stuff? Very excited. Like I said the boys that are coming through today, some young. Young, good young men.\n\nSome of them are some characters as well. So if we can find more of them, hopefully we want to help all of them. Sometimes I understand that we can't, but if we can find, help them become, like I said, great young men instead of good workers. They could learn what we are trying to do here and then go somewhere else and execute that.\n\nThat's all we want for them. And to do the work you need, like businesses and people to come on board, like what's the message for businesses that you think should give these fellows a go? And why do you reckon that like the bigger [00:04:00] corporations should, think about how they can help this cohort of young kids better?\n\nI think about, it's about all about understanding what they go through. I like the idea what you said about the photos. With a lot of the huge crime and stuff like that. I, me and my partner always argue about it. She said she put 'em on the island somewhere, and I told her, I always tell her it's the way they've been brought up.\n\nIt's the circumstances they've been raised at. So I think if corporations are, like, if big companies, they wanna invest in these young fellas, if they can understand why it's hard for them to find jobs and why it's hard for them to create something for themselves it could go a long way. Like I said I'm a bit how do I say it?\n\nNot sympathetic, but like I, I know what they're going through. Like I told you before I've been around boys this whole my life, so I know what they're going through and stuff like that. So I think if they're big corporations and people want to invest, if they know the struggles. That these boys go through then they could go a long way for them to investing their time or energy into these fellas, which is that camera is a great idea.\n\nI thought it was an excellent idea. No, I can't wait to see it. All right, bro. Gonna take a photo. You ready? [00:05:00] Yep.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Ben on Diagrama\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nHello mate. Good eye line. Um, that's my bad. It's good. This is your second, second time to diagram. What's changed since you have, what's changed since last time you were here? I was last in diagram in. Probably a year ago. Yeah. Yeah, a year ago now. And I think I was caught up in how different everything was and how inspired I was of what that organization had achieved over 30 years.\n\nAnd then I go home and I sort of go back to what is normal in Australia and. I got the chance to go to a few detention centers in between, and I think especially when I went to Don Dale that last time, it sort of affected me the most in terms of thinking that [00:01:00] for decades, young people had been spending time in a place that perpetuated fear, anger, distrust, and just, just a horrible environment.\n\nSo to come back and also to have my friend Nicholas with me to think about what these next steps are. It felt like home or it felt like something that I was achievable. The things that in those diagram of centers are not magic. They're not anything that you need decades of. Research and practice and principles, um, to be able to stand up again because they've already done that.\n\nAnd although my Spanish is not perfect, I got the opportunity to sit and talk with some young people, and I only see opportunity and brightness in their eyes when the educators are talking to them. [00:02:00] It feels like they're talking to their uncle or their brother or um, or someone that is there to help them.\n\nAnd that occurs sometimes in Australia, but it's happening in a place in which is very much a very difficult place to feel like there are possibilities after this. So\n\nthis time of diagram. I just felt even more excited to be able to, uh, see what happens if we can, um, create some of that same magic in Australia. What, um, what's the sense like you're doing a lot of sharing at the moment? Like what is the sentiment around, um, new justice and what's happening in you?\n\nPushback? Are you feeling excitement? Yeah, there's two speeds. And I think [00:03:00] one speed is, especially the government want to perpetuate a message in which I think they want to show that they're strong and they've got a handle on this youth justice stuff. And that's perpetuated through the news where it's, it is very right.\n\nWhat's happening. There are horrible things happening. Young people are doing some really bad things, but. The way in which there's only one voice as part of this, is really creating a pendulum that a lot of money's being spent, and a lot of people are fearful, but the actual results of that money are actually perpetuating the problem.\n\nAnd there's some. It's, there's two sides of the argument, which I want to try and work out how we can come together, because I don't think there's any [00:04:00] good that comes from, um, coming from a place of fear and from what I've seen at Diagram and the way they approach things. And David, uh, the CEO has said this to me many times, is that.\n\nThey don't feel like they have competition in Australia because they know that they, what they have is their product is really good. There's no other private entities that are offering something on par. The government's obviously not able to achieve the outcomes that they want, and so the opportunity to provide a product that works is like legitimate and I think something that we should be striving for.\n\nUm,\n\nthere's some amazing people at the moment, especially within the smaller communities that are doing some great work on the ground and the [00:05:00] engagement that I see they have with young people mirrors what happens in a diagram center. So the more we can get those programs supported and growing and also connecting with each other.\n\nI think that decentralized approach of justice is possible where you don't need to stand up $150 million programs through government or build centers. You can actually support everyone and everyone supports each other to do the things that they do naturally. And that is, I think, but having a cultural connection, having like whether it's a spiritual connection, whether it's just a mentoring connection.\n\nI think if we can do that more often, then create these expensive programs, the better we can.\n\nUm, good day. Hey puppy. Hey puppy. [00:06:00] Um, maybe while we're on that, uh, what's your thinking behind Justice Hub? Oh, um, now it's calling us. Um, justice Hub's been a\n\nfocus. Um, it's been an, it's been an incredible experience to spend a lot of time in community. Um, being able to spend time in Alice Springs, Palm Island, Strad, broke Island. Doing local level programs in in Brisbane, all through Mount Isa, and what I see is the same people doing amazing work. But they just don't have the resource or they don't have the capacity to be able to support what they do on a bigger scale.\n\nAnd everything relates back to having a strong community connection. And [00:07:00] so people driving around the streets, waving at each other, honking their horns, hugging each other, giving each other. High fives is not something that you can just fabricate or pay for. And so that's why I think this idea of Justice Hub has legs because.\n\nWhat I think can be the result is that all these people, they start to think about what they're all doing and sharing, and then they share resource, and then they share programs, and then they share that capacity. And so one of the things I think happens is these people get burnt out because they're trying to do too much with not much resource.\n\nSo imagine if you could prop everyone up to have a a, a pool of mentors and a pool of resources to do the work. Oh, what's your dog's name? Marlow. Hey, Marlow. Are you part of the farm here or no? We got a little workshop. Oh, what do you do? Engineering stuff. Oh, cool. What sort of engineering? Um, automotive, clean tech.\n\nIt's very neat. Okay. What's an example of that? Like a street sweeper or? [00:08:00] No, it has to do with break dust emissions. Oh, to break dust emissions. That's cool. So we've got just a little studio in there making prototypes. Oh. That's cool. What are you guys doing? Um, brake pads are like asbestos something. There used to be.\n\nNo, no. What are they now? It's pretty complicated. They're like 12 different, um, mostly metals. Yeah. Then there's like some gas, um, gas, uh, chemical reaction that happens that creates more particles that we dunno where they are. So there's the break pads and then there's the random stuff, the thoughts from.\n\nYeah. Wow. Cool. And electric cars don't have brakes, do they? Or they They do. They have regenerative braking also helps, but there's still a lot of freight. Wow. Uh, what do we do? We're, uh, we just, uh, making a blob blo. We went, we've been to Spain and then to, um, UK to, there's a charity called Diagram and they support young kids [00:09:00] in youth detention.\n\nNice. And in Australia, in the uk they do support with disabilities and foster care. Okay. And so we're trying to steal their stuff and take it Australia. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We, I ran past this yesterday. I, oh, this is cool. And we were do a little background. Um, you said it's background? Yeah. It was just noisy out in the streets.\n\nAnd we're also hanging with the washing machine project. Have you seen seen their signs? I've seen them online, yeah. Everywhere. Oh, cool. We'll have to tell it. It was just ringing me. Yeah, they pop up everywhere. Great. It works great. Yeah. Alright guys. Good luck. Nice to meet you. Thank you.\n\nMilo, I have another go at that. Um, no, I think, like, say if you were going to sum up the justice Yeah. Hub in a couple sentences. What, what is the Justice Hub? Justice Hub is a database of, um, professionals around Australia that are doing amazing community based work, um, across all states of Australia. It's a way to share [00:10:00] stories, share challenges, share opportunities.\n\nAnd also create an understanding of what is the, um, heat map of Australian Youth Justice and what's happening at a community level. Why is it needed at the moment? There is a small amount of large organizations, um, taking a lot of the resources for funding in relation to youth justice and also the government.\n\nAnd I think what needs to happen is the grassroots organizations. Need to be able to have a place where they can come together, share from each other, but grow from the ground up so that the young people that are being supported are connected to their community in a really, um, in a really safe way. And then also trying to work out what are all of those gaps that are occurring, that are creating those high rates of recidivism and those small amount of young people who are, um, creating most of the crime.\n\nAnd a good example is somewhere like [00:11:00] Mount Isa, where they have half of the state's offending in a very small, um, area. So the opportunity to support someone like Brody Germaine, who's doing fitness and camping on country programs, to have mentors, to have resource and then to be able to share that with other people.\n\nI think that creates a really great opportunity to. Um, grow this community of, um, doers that are solving problems in their community, but then also having the opportunity to scale that around Australia. What do you think the impact of something like Diagram could have on Australia? What diagram has shown me is that youth justice can be solved with common sense.\n\nAnd I think Australia's got to a certain level of risk that they don't know how to go back now. And so the opportunity to learn from a society, um, around how [00:12:00] they've been able to reverse that problem over the last 30 years, I think that we can take. Little bits of what they've been able to achieve and slowly integrate that into a system that's not working.\n\nAnd I think that over the long term, what we'll see is not just young people, um, having better outcomes, but the government's saving money. And then I think the overall goal in my mind, whether it's 5, 10, 20 years, is for just the general community to have an understanding around what it's like to be a young person.\n\nAnd to think about how they would feel if their son or daughter was in youth detention and how they would want them to be, um, engaged with as a human. And then, yeah, when, when there, um, there's always gonna be crimes and people doing bad things, but I think if we can show those young people that I'm able in a tough spot at that time, that they can go somewhere, learn, grow, and come [00:13:00] back as a respected, uh, member of the community.\n\nI think that would be a amazing outcome for Australia.\n\nUm,\n\nI think i's not shortcut. Um, I'm really interested at the moment what a curious track can be in the future. I, over the last two years, we've been able to use these values of curiosity, learning and taking action and learning from mistakes and opportunities to, um, partner in a different way. And I'm really interested to see what happens when the people that we are partnering with understand that if you're able to.\n\nGive [00:14:00] everything of yourself and work together as a, um, work together to create the outcome that you want. I think we can start to see a different type of contract, a different type of MOU, a different type of partnership that actually starts to grow really great compounding solutions to problems and. Um, yeah.\n\nIt creates this, uh, system where you don't have to stand up a brand and like, feel like your baby's going to die if you do something wrong. I think if you can create that collaborative sort of partnership solution, um, yeah, it's gonna reduce that strain on founders and organizations and yeah, create opportunities where they can compound impact together rather than own it yourself.\n\nSo much to ask you Benno, but, um, what was it like meeting Nav? Nav? Yeah. [00:15:00] I, I feel like it's a reverse of what true I had for like David and Di well, I talked, I'd, I'd, I'd been put on the voice call with NAV a few times and I could feel his energy. It's, it's very addictive and yeah. You've talked about NAV in a way in which I really understand what he's trying to do.\n\nBut yeah, to see him, um, in Athens for the first time, it really made me think about what this idea of like vision and mission and like passion is. And I think sometimes I get passion out and mission doubt because it's like that's what happens when you hang around the not-for-profit vision sector. But yeah, nav was just everything that I think needs to be here, like on this earth.\n\nIt's, um, he has the ability to bring people on [00:16:00] his journey and the things that he gets up on stage to say, translates through to him hanging out with, um, the women that were on the street in Athens, to people that he meets at a shop, to people that. Yell at him when he is riding on the wrong side of the road and riding on street bikes where he's not supposed to.\n\nUm, but yeah, it's just an awesome, genuine human that I'd love to spend more time with and learn from and grow with over time. And what, um, this is for your own record, but like, thanks mate. Um, what's going through your head right now about your family moving to Spain? What's that look like? I really want.\n\nTo find that balance of, it's like what I just talked about with nav, right? Like I could solve all the solutions in the world, but I would not be happy if the girls weren't happy and why, and Carla wasn't happy. So I think this has been awesome to be [00:17:00] able to test what living overseas is like. To have them over in Paris, just.\n\nHaving fun, hopefully, um, whilst I'm working is a, a good test as well, and I, yeah, I, I don't want it to be something that like, my life will be horrible if I don't get to take these opportunities because I think these are some things I just want to be always on where if it feels right, if they feel good.\n\nIf there's opportunities for coming together, if they're learning culture, if they're doing something different, just wanna keep doing that. And, um, if that's in Annaly at my house playing Uno, or if it's walking up Ma Machu Pichu, um, together, I think like I just want it all to be, um, something we're all on the same page with and connected [00:18:00] to.\n\n",

Um, so I guess from the last time we yarned to now, what's um, been going on? \n\nSpeaker 2: So we're continuing the cleanup. Um, last time we finished off with the big compost pile, getting some mulch around so that settled down really nicely. There was large piles of all the weeds and we ended up deciding that there were so many weed seeds here, we've put them in piles and covered them in black plastic.\n\nSo there's a method of killing weeds and the seeds off called solarization. So we're doing that. We'll have a look at some of those and today's just continuing with the clean in an area that's going to be hopefully a lovely community space, maybe some seating and areas we can meet up. So do you want me to show you through there?\n\nRight, let's go. Let's go. Did \n\nSpeaker: someone sweep this path? Yeah, \n\nSpeaker 2: someone amazing. Um, our amazing cameraman. Thank you Ben. Look at the job. You want to go first? Look at this [00:01:00] path. As they say, what an entrance. Um, and we've just done a little bit of tidying along here because I think the walls are going to get some gurning.\n\nSo we cut a lot of nice herbs, which are lovely, but plants back from here. Look at all the tomatoes. I think we're going to get those and make um, More, uh, Nick wants some more sugo. Yeah, they are good. And here there's the comfrey, which is an amazing plant for, um, getting nutrients into the soil. So I've cut it all back and laid it here.\n\nI should put some mulch on top and let this all decompose in the ground, but I'm running out of mulch, so I can't mulch it today. But still, it'll work here to cover and suppress. um, areas where the weeds might grow up. So, um, that's great. And then we've, uh, Nick's taken down the, there was a cover here that was really damaged.\n\nAnd so he's taken that down and put that in the bin because we can't compost [00:02:00] that. It wasn't, it was a synthetic fabric, uh, and lots of pruning and I'll get out of the way so you can see, um, cutting back all the, uh, big salvias here. Just pulling out any weeds through this whole area Because this path here links up to the top garden So this is like the main access for people coming through and then accessing the garden so we want to make sure this is nice and clear to get up to um, Yeah, where the gardening areas are Some really lovely plants.\n\nThis is a nice, um, sage flowering sage \n\nSpeaker: and what's on the top of this? Oh \n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, I love this. So we've got a Madagascar bean, which is a perennial bean. It's um, similar to um, what kind of bean? Like a limer bean. Um, and yeah, it's really high source of protein. So it's great that it's growing there. It will [00:03:00] continue to grow and we'll be able to get the lovely beans off that.\n\nAnd then on this side is a cute little plant called a cucamelon. And we'll try and. Fine one. There's one right up the top there. I can't reach. Oh, yeah. Can you see that? Yeah, this \n\nSpeaker: one will get up there. You might \n\nSpeaker 2: be able to reach that out, Ben, and have a look inside. Um, they're like a little, let me have a look here.\n\nIt's like, looks like a little tiny watermelon, and then when you crack it open, it's like a cucumber on the inside with a slight lemon flavor. They are really delicious. I want to eat that because my hands are a bit grubby. If I put that on the ground, it might regrow. So a lot of these, um, have regrown from seed that's fallen down.\n\nSo this is nice to know that, you know, today we've been walking along, picking the little kicker melons and eating them. And there's a lot more of these Madagascar beans forming. So, you know for someone like me that doesn't eat meat These are a great source of protein and they [00:04:00] store really well. Let's see if there's any in here No, that hasn't fully developed, but you can actually say see they're like pinky color so some of them get quite large and They're great in a slow cooker.\n\nSo very um, meaty those \n\nSpeaker: And where, if you could like, um, identify where we're at in the journey of, um, sort of regeneration of this place, where we're at? \n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we're really, um, you know, um, getting through these areas and, and clearing out so we can actually see the plants in here that are going to be really useful and we'll want to keep.\n\nSo today, by sort of clearing this area, this is a main access through to the building. So it just means we can come through now and assess the areas and look at what's here and what can be used and what these areas can be used like as far as the space, what can be created here and access to the building and connection to the [00:05:00] garden.\n\nSo that's been great. Um, and continuing to get out the, all the weeds out of here. So they're not continuing to be a problem. I think it's like breaking that cycle of them re seeding and re growing. So that's really important and um, getting those covered and then yeah, identifying what's here and um, starting to look like, you know, it's a cared for space.\n\nWhich is really lovely. \n\nSpeaker: From like discovering this place and coming and looking at it initially knowing what it was to now, where's your mind going in terms of where you thought this was going to where we are after sort of hanging out and \n\nSpeaker 2: being in the space for a bit? Um, I think it, it means soon we could start to welcome people into the space.\n\nUm, and potentially talk about, you know, community connection here and, and bringing people together to, Um, assist and nurture the space now that it's opened up [00:06:00] areas, it's um, it is safer to come through. So I feel comfortable now saying to groups of people, come and meet us in the garden and maybe we could start doing some, you know, nature based or garden based activities here.\n\nYeah. \n\nSpeaker: That's \n\nSpeaker 2: cool. \n\nSpeaker: And um, how's it been feeling for you, I suppose, just like? Getting your hands dirty and being in this stuff and being part of this journey. Like, what's the journey been like for you so \n\nSpeaker 2: far? Um, I love it. I'm very grateful for being part of this journey. I love to get my hands into a project like this.\n\nAnd, uh, for me. You know, being in the garden is a, is a therapeutic space for me. That's why, you know, I'm in the therapeutic space in horticulture. Um, and it is really nice to see what's here, the smells, what we've been touching and tasting just as we go. Um. It's almost by being like a little just journey of discovering what's [00:07:00] here and that's been great like we found sweet potatoes and tomatoes and passion fruit and Cucamelons and so as you know the intention to clean up the space and get it ready For others to come and enjoy it.\n\nWe've been discovering little things. So\n\nSpeaker: Have you been talking to other people about this space and have there been things that people have been saying as you've been talking? \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have mentioned the space to a few people and the potential and what we're considering doing. And there's a lot of interest. Uh, I, um, have spoken to people that would love to come to a space where they can garden with others.\n\nSo knowing that there would be potentially an area that they can garden and we can grow things together and have that social interaction, which is great. That's been a really positive thing and other people, um, that, you know, know the work that I like to do and know that there's a [00:08:00] space for groups to come and meet here, even if it's not to garden, even if it's for another reason, it is a lovely space that, you know, you can immerse yourself in.\n\nGet the benefits of being in such a lovely, um, environment here. \n\nSpeaker: And I just thought of another question, sorry, last one. Um, Nick and I were at the, went for a swim down the creek near Mullaney yesterday and we met a lady who is doing some, um, drug and alcohol work with kids. Um, they go to the creek and they swim and stuff.\n\nWhat do you think that idea of bringing people from all different demographics, life experiences, doing different things in the same space, what do you think? Um, that brings to a space like this where it's not just one thing, where it's community and there's like complexity and that sort of stuff as part of \n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nI think a space like this, anything in nature is open to everybody. Um, and it's a place where everyone can come and feel welcome. There's no judgment here. [00:09:00] There's no expectations of what you have to do. It's just to come here and enjoy the space. And for me in the past when I've worked with people that People that don't like gardening or aren't used to being in such a natural space, they may spend a lot of time indoors or in devices, or they've been in situations where they can't get outside, just to come to a space and be here and immerse yourself just in it to start with and then see what happens.\n\nUm, and usually then it's like people notice things, they might touch something and it smells a certain way or it looks really fascinating, so they Want to explore a little more. That's a kind of great opportunity to give everybody it's just like just come here and Just be and then from that just see what happens or develops organically and naturally And that's what I like about a space like this It's like [00:10:00] we're providing this, you know, lovely space for people to come to let's just see what evolves when they get here\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Tracy & Jared\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThese broadcast comes, oh, an acronym for a military. Alright. Mics are good. You're good? Yep. Let's go. Okay. And first what we'll do is say your full name and spell it for me. It'll be awesome. Full as in na, first and last or just, okay. Okay. Tracy McIntyre. T-R-A-C-Y-M-C-I-N-T-Y-R-E. Amazing.\n\nAnd just your role, David. Just a general volunteer. Awesome. Yeah. Jared Keating. So G-E-R-A-R-D-K-A-T-I-N-G, like the former Prime Minister. And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "So, we usually start with your name and you spell it. And that's like the service we're giving you. So, my name's Anna King. It's A-N-A-K-I-N-G. Cool. Tell us a little bit about yourself first, I guess. A little bit about myself. I've been at Bega for about 16 years through different roles. Currently, at the moment, I'm the Health Programs Coordinator. And I have Aboriginal early years through Connected Beginnings. We also have the Community Safety and Wellbeing Program, which is about engagement and AOD. And we also have the Orange Sky with Philip. Cool. Tell us your perception of what Bega is, I guess. Like, what is Bega? Bega, I would say, is an Aboriginal health service that caters to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families throughout the gold fields. We not only do clinical services, but we also have a wide range of services that tap into social and emotional wellbeing, social support sort of services with homeless, French dwellers. We also have tackling indigenous smoking teams. Lots of engagement through AOD youth programs. And we also have... like our counsellor services. But generally, we've got a wide range of staff. We even have an environmental team who goes out. So we really try and cater to the health and wellbeing of everything. Both social, physical, emotional, detriments of a person. So glad to talk to you. You're good at this. I suppose you've been kind of, you know, like, you've been looking at the social and mental health of your own. I suppose you've been here for a very long time. Yeah. How does your own experience connect with what you do in terms of the community connection and stuff? Yeah, so I have been on lots of different strategy groups, whether it be for early years, it could be for they used to have one for Aboriginal families. I'm very passionate about working in community and being a part of community, but giving of myself to help as many families as we can. I started here in the Crèche as a Crèche coordinator, and I worked there for about ten years. So I've seen so many families come through. I'm passionate about education. But not only that, once I left the Crèche, I've seen these children not only grow from children, but now they're either youth or adults and they're running their own families. So just seeing that whole picture is quite a beautiful thing. But definitely to be part of community here, if we look at the gold fields, one of the greatest things that I think I can see in this community is that there are so many people that give. This community will always be there. Thank you. And I think that's something that we will always continue to give. And there are so many services here that if we were able to collaborate really effectively together, we could do so much. That's so cool. Tell us a bit about how you first heard about Orange Sky, I guess. So we heard about Orange Sky quite a few years ago, and it was just sort of like a thought that somebody had. And then I guess it went through different pipelines, where Clyde was able to do some work to actually get it here. I think community heard about Orange Sky coming, so it sort of had this trickle effect into community where they were excited about it coming. They weren't too sure how it was going to look, and then when they heard that Beagle was taking that on, they got excited to see what it would happen and do for community. That's cool. What did you think of that? What did you think about the concept I heard, I suppose, when you heard about it? When I first saw it, I was like, wow, that is amazing. Three washing machines and three dryers in one truck. But I was like, but how is it going to work? Will it really be utilised? But I saw, so Stuart was the first person who ran the service when it first came here. And he absolutely loved it. And he had this sort of like, this passion for it that made everyone want to find out about it, you know. But what I've actually seen with the service, so he's taken it and he was doing roughly, Church of Christ has probably been our biggest service provider. They also predominantly, 90% of all their clients are probably our clients too. So it works really well down there. They used to do on average about 22 loads down there. They are averaging about 50 odd loads now. So it has increased tenfold, you know. One, it's hard work for Philip. He loves it. He's great. Nothing's too hard for Philip, you know. But what we can see is that community really need it. Yeah. There's been something that was said in community once the orange sky had come to town. And then they also got like a shower bath. They said that everyone, you could see the confidence in people walking around the streets. Whereas before, people didn't, who weren't able to have showers, who weren't able to have clean clothes, they would slump. They wouldn't look up, you know. Whereas now they're out and about in town. They look as happy as they can be, you know. It's almost like giving them a new sense of life. Yeah. That's a beautiful way to put it. We, I get to travel around a lot, see orange sky ships in urban environments and some regional. Yeah. We talk a lot about this word friends. Friends is a word we use for our friends on the street doing it tough. We just did a podcast called The F Word. And I know that friends maybe has a different meaning or there's a different word for it or something in community. But how does that sort of resonate for you in terms of like a concept of like that dignity and connection with people who are using the service? Does that carry through to how it operates here? I think it does. I think I've never thought of it that way. But when you think about friends, you think about love, you think about caring, you think about connection. If you can make a connection with a person, you can make their day, you know. You don't know where they've come from or what sort of night they've had, whether they've even eaten. But to say hello to somebody, to actually ask about their day, to generally find out about them, it's not hard to do. And it doesn't cost much. But it can mean so much to that person. Yeah. Yeah, you've got the Orange Sky ethos pretty much down pat. It's hard sometimes to explain, you know, what the situation is for people, I think, in places like Kalgoorlie. How can you, in your own mind, how do you represent, I suppose, some of the struggles in the day-to-day existence of some people in Kalgoorlie doing it tough? Oh, you know, I actually think that people who are even in jobs at the moment are having it tough. So when I look at everyone in like a tough sort of situation, I just think, probably maybe four years ago, the price of butter was about $2 something. We're now looking at about $6 to $7 for the same butter. So I think toughness could be out there for a lot of people in general. But those who don't have a roof over their head know when their next meal's coming. And I think that's a big part of it. Clothes on their back, or just even a blanket to keep warm at night. I don't think there's many words for, I don't think tough sort of comes into that for them. I don't know what that's like because I've never been in that situation. But I can only imagine that it's, that tough is probably just on the tip of it. It's not really probably a word that resonates. It's not really a word that resonates with them. But we have a lot of people in Kalgoorlie who are struggling and they're out on the streets or they have nowhere to go. It's even families. It's not even just individual people. And so for them when they come in, I guess they're a little bit heightened and they don't know what the future brings for them. And they're just reaching out for people to help them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, so I went to Church of Christ, Boulder Camp and Ingramire. And the way in which this service operates is different to like urban because essentially they've got some chairs, people sit around in urban and they have a bit of a yoke. But it feels to me like there's a different type of connection that happens. The regularity going to where they are fills like status I think as well. So I think there's two parts. It's like tell us a bit about Phil and why he's an important part of this thing. And then also what do you see as like that idea of connection where it's not only just sitting for ages and yarning and yarning, but the regularity over an extent and the period to know that they're coming back. Yeah. Well, Phillip has, Phillip's quite caring. So he's, and he's quite softly spoken and he's just got this genuine nature about him where he truly cares, you know. And I think people just by his smile, just by him even rocking up all the time and the consistency, the consistency behind it, it helps them. It helps them to be able to keep coming back if they need to use the service. But he'll have conversations with people whilst he's trying, but he's just flat out I think, you know. So it would be really great if we could get somebody else to work alongside him, you know. And I guess that way they would be able to offset somebody could be doing a bit of work and then others could be really having conversations, you know, with people. I even felt different. I don't know, like I suppose I've only been there once, but people at Nigga Maya had a particular way about them and coming to Shift and almost like going back to where they were. People at Boulder were kind of there and they were just like ready to be part of what Orange Sky is. Just like so, so, so keen and Church of Christ was different. Again, because it was way more family environment type thing. How, I suppose there's a whole idea of scale and impact. What do you think Orange Sky's impact is as part of this ecosystem of support in the community? Like how do you see that? I actually see that Orange Sky can be the link that can bring everyone together because I think, I think Philip being able to go to different places, without the Orange Sky and being able to have that facility, maybe we wouldn't engage so much in those places. But every week he consistently turns up, you know. And not only that, our friends or our clients, they still come to use the service as well. So it's definitely one that's needed. But I think, but I think it's something that will bring people together. Yeah, yeah. Even though it could be a necessity for them and a need. I don't know. I think, I think everybody has, like I think at first the numbers were low because I think some people were a bit scared to come and use the service. You know, because I think it would take a lot to, have to come out and bring your, you know, washing and stuff. But then I think after a while what they realise is actually it's okay. You know, this is what the service is for. It's for me. And everyone just comes down. Yeah. And I think they are not ashamed about it. There's a positiveness that comes with it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a beautiful thing when things cut through shame. There's so many services where you want people to come and attend but there's shame associated with it. But yeah, I definitely didn't see shame. I saw like a keenness. Yeah. They're excited. They really are excited. Yeah. Yeah. And when he rocks up, you know, you can just see how happy they are that he's there. That he's definitely there. Yeah. Cool. So, future I guess. What do you see as the future in Kalgoorlie and like Bega and stuff? Like what's next over the next little while you think? Over the next little while I think Bega will continue to grow with different programmes. I think Orange Sky is going to grow. So we not only do Kalgoorlie, we do the Goldfields region. So we'll go Laverton. We'll go to Esperance and everywhere in between. I can actually see that Orange Sky could start branching out within the Goldfields region. I definitely know Laverton, you know, is in need and would love some type of service up there. I don't think that Orange Sky would look like a mobile service for us because he's currently needed in some way. Because he's currently needed in town. But I mean, if they had two trucks, you know, that could be a possibility. But I definitely know wherever Orange Sky would like branch out to or even grow and potentially have two trucks here, it would definitely be used. One thing we've been really interested in, I say we as like I used to work at Orange Sky, but I say we because it's what it is. I think the big push at the moment is to look at Orange Sky as almost like a philosophy and an approach rather than a mobile vehicle. How do you think that might work if there was like a container had some washers and dryers in it, had some chairs? Does that still carry through in your mind that that's still an Orange Sky initiative? That's still like a powerful opportunity to engage in? To engage, I guess. Like just thinking about because Orange Sky's trialed like taking over laundry mats and having like pods and going to motels and stuff. Like just interested in your thoughts of like Orange Sky as a idea rather than a mobile vehicle. Like how do you, how does that sort of sit? Orange Sky as an idea. I think. I'm not sure if I've got this right. No, that's okay. That's okay. If it was still like a service and not as in a truck, but it was, are you meaning like if it was based somewhere permanently? Yeah. And then set up? I definitely think it'll still work. Yeah. I think if people see beyond Orange Sky as being a truck, they can still see that Orange Sky could be, you know, a service. Yeah. Like a laundry service somewhere that could still be yarning and still connection. Like. Yeah. I, even though it is the Orange Truck and at the moment, you know, and people talk about this Orange Sky. However, I think it is more than that. Yeah. I definitely do. And yes, it is the laundry service. But I think more so it's more about connections, you know. And when I think about Orange Sky, my thoughts are. And when I think about Orange Sky myself and how I've been able to deal with them in the past and going into the future, it's a really easy service to deal with. There's no problems. They always are proactive. Communication is really great. And I think that sort of like gets put into community the way that they are with us. It's sort of we put that on to our friends as well in community. So I think regardless of what they do, whether it's a truck, whether it's a building, I don't think things would change so much. I think the Orange Sky, however it is put into community, will flourish. Yeah. And one last one. Jude's not here. She wished you could be here. Any shout outs for Judith? Seriously, Judith and the team, they are amazing. Yeah. They're super easy to work with. We never have a problem. They'll always take care of it. If they need anything, they'll probably generally come to us before we'll go to them. But then they normally go, we'll get little emails saying, there's a pickup, just go and pick it up. Or our dealings with them, simple, easy, and they're pretty fast at returning responses. So, no, we really enjoy working with them. Yeah. So good. She's pretty jealous that she got me. I bet she is. At least you'll get to see it. And yeah, I'm super keen to come back soon. And I think there's a real, there's a real beautiful story here that I'd love to keep talking about. And I see like down at Church of Christ there, there's just a constant slide show of people and, you know, it's just, it's a beautiful story. And I think it's very important to have that. Yeah. And I think that's what I'd love to see, too, is to see people in the community. Yeah. And I think that's what I'd love to see. Yeah. And I think that's what I'd love to see. Yeah. And I think that's what I'd love to see, too, is just a constant slide show of photos of what's happening. Like, if we can continue to celebrate what's happening, like return those photos and show the videos of how this is all coming together, I think that's, in my mind, a great story. Not like, not the fancy one that goes to the sponsors. Yeah. But the one that connects back with the community, hopefully. Yeah, definitely. Cool. Because I think, yeah, connection's everything, I think. Yeah. That was so good. Yeah. You were rad. That slide was really cool.\n",

      "Transcript": "I got set free brother, I tell you what, it's a good feeling mate. Now God wings it for us. Oh yeah, we rely on God a bit mate. Cool, so what you can do with these, it's kind of fun, is like, it sort of does this. That's better, I'll set it to the gil. Oh yeah, see it's easy when you know how, ain't it mate? I was gonna say, I felt a little bit of a little fluffy, fluffy thing in your face, that's good mate. Yeah, and the sound actually works really well in your sternum. And it looks like, yeah it looks like a special little reward or something mate. A little DJI of that. Oh wait, that's it. Cool, well I think the best thing to do is you go say your full name and spell it for me, just so I've got that. Yeah, Kevin Voss, V-O-S, K-E-V-I-N is Kevin and Voss is V-O-S. And Veronica Voss, V-E-R-O-N-I-C-A and Voss, V-O-S. Who wants to kick us off with a little bit about you both I guess? Go for it sister. Okay. So literally, we met when we were 15 and in an institution, in a welfare institution. And we got pretty badly tortured in that institution in Western Australia here. And we got pretty badly tortured in that institution in Western Australia here. And then we didn't see each other for 40 years. So we both like did a Moses journey, you know we call it. And I went to live on the east coast and Kevin stayed here in Western Australia. And then I came back in 2020 and Kevin was still alive, thank goodness. Because I didn't know whether he'd be alive or dead. Just alive. A few people didn't make it that were in the institution with us. So then God started us on a journey of, we already knew God, but God started us on a journey of travelling and he said take Jesus to the streets. So we've survived a lot of things, suffered from a lot of depression and PTSD. And now we're walking the streets with Jesus. We're doing chaplaincy. Praise God. We've been in Kalgoorlie for a couple of months after our African trip, doing missionary work. And now we're at M25. It's like the hub of the community where all agencies come together. And there's God in it as well, you know. That's really important to us that it's holistic. So it's body, soul and spirit, you know. People need food for their body. They also need spiritual food. And they get services like washing and showering and clothes and the food and whatever services they need. They're here and we love that. We love that about this. Can you paint a picture of where we are I guess? What is this place we're at and what's happening at the moment I guess? Well we're 600 kilometres roughly thereabouts from Perth East in the gold fields. It's a big mining hub. There's a big pit over there. It's one of the biggest pits in the world. Gold pits. And I think they've been pulling gold out of there probably for nearly 100 years. Yeah, there's 14 different tribes. In the gold fields. Yeah, there's 14 tribes in the gold fields area. Actually is it 14 tribes? This hub too. Yeah, this hub. Around this hub, yeah. Yeah, so around this hub. And yeah, it's a very community based area. And yeah, what we've found since we've been here is that the churches have been pulling together. And it's really becoming a really good community spirit. And yeah, this place here. Which is attached to the church there behind us. Church of Christ. Have put this centre together. And now there's all churches getting involved in it. And well we just feel the peace and the love in this place. It's a place for people to come and rest. Especially the people out there that live on the fringes of the town. And we're just so gracious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we're just so grateful to God that he's pointed us in the right direction to come here. And to be able to serve. So it's a really good community feeling here. And all different people sort of like come here. It becomes just one blood, one place for everybody just to enjoy each other's company. Share testimony. And also to realise that God will meet you where you're at, no matter where you're at. And that God will meet you there. And the good thing is a lot about this place as well is there's no judgement here. No condemnation. And that's the beautiful thing I like. I myself and my wife, we lived on the streets in our time before. And we always felt like that we got judged. There was judgement there. So anyway, that's a bit about this place. And yeah, we're just so glad to be part of it. And so gracious that God opened doors and brought us here. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think central to that is, this is the first place, we've travelled around a bit, went to Geraldton first, came here, that this is the first place we've seen like a really concerted effort, a concerted unity, like between churches and agencies, like in town. And we're just doing a chaplaincy course at the moment that they started up in Kalgoorlie, which we graduate in at the end of October. But... It's compartmental with this and being out on the streets. We're seeing people out on the streets that we're meeting here. So there's a real united front. And, man, every, like, all these facilities in this block alone that people can come in and have every, you know, literally, besides a house, everything that they need, without a donation tin at the gate is, like, so powerful. Every place, every regional area should have something like this because this homelessness and everything that's happening here is happening, we've seen it in other regional areas, that there's no reason why this can't happen in other places. Tell us a little bit about this thing behind us here and were you here when it came and what's been the impact of it? I think this has been, the whole centre, this centre's been going for about two years. I'm not sure how long the washing machine, cyclist has been here, but I think that all, like, came together. So there's three washing machines and three industrial drawers and Phillip doesn't stop. There's, people have their own bags, their names on them, they put their washing in and it gets dried. They can shower while all that's happening, have breakfast and then come back. I actually saw it in North Queensland as well during cyclone seasons. So to have it here, we're... to have it here, they've got a washing machine where they are, or a dryer or... yeah, it's fantastic, it's really fantastic. Because they have a change of clothes that they can pick up, so they get their, have a shower, they get their clothes washed and dried and they can pick up their clothes from before that they've got stored in a storeroom inside there, so that they've got the clothes that they take off, they can get washed on the day and then they've got a change of clothes there that they can get into. So they've always got a spare set of clothes in there and that must do it. be a really good security and just knowing that they can have a clean set of clothes when they come in here for them that must be a nice thing for them because being out there in the elements obviously doesn't really make you feel spiritually good I suppose. And they can walk away here being fed, warm belly, filled belly and have a nice change of clothes and be showered. But it's like one of those basic forms of dignity isn't it? Yeah, well that's right. To be clean and have clean clothes. If you've got that all the time you take it for granted but for someone who hasn't got any of it to come here and be able to be clean, have clean clothes, change the clothes, it's powerful as a human being to have dignity in that. It's huge isn't it? Yeah, I've been in the street there and had a fractured soul and all the rest that goes on with it. And then when you're filthy as well it's really hard to believe that you can actually get yourself out of that pit. So just to be tidy and spiritually filled up with love and care. Makes you feel filthy on the inside doesn't it? Well of course it does, yeah. So definitely they can feel like they're living again and that somebody cares for them when they walk away from here. That's for sure. One last question. So Orange Sky started by two young fellas just with an idea to wash clothes but it turned into this idea. So if you think about the relationship and connection part really like here around friendship and connection. Yeah. When you think about those words of friendship and connection what comes to mind in terms of what's happening here I guess ? Friendship and connection, well again with friendship and connection it feels like actually feel that you're human and that you're wanted. That somebody cares and that you do matter. Because I like it. You know, with obviously being homeless and all out in the elements, there's always a reason behind that. And with that goes like emptiness, not feeling like that you're really worthy. And, you know, when you can come to a place like this and feel like that there's a community and you just don't have to look too far to see the community, one blood and, you know, don't worry about what colour skin we are. God, let us all equal, you know, and for people to be able to rest, a bit of basketball, clean clothes, have a shower, have a feed and just connect with each other. And you know what, without any, it's unconditional, unconditional love and friendship. And I think that that really matters because I know what it feels like to just feel lost in life and not really feel like that you're connected to anybody. So it's a power. It's a powerful thing for people just to be able to feel like that they matter and that somebody does care. And, you know, God's always there for you. But, you know, to come and have that interaction with people, it's a really good situation for yourself as far as when you walk away that you can just take with you that somebody does care and get on with the rest of your day type thing. So I think it's a powerful thing to have friendship and connection, unconditional with no judgment, you know, especially. So that's my point of view. So when we think of community, community is like communicate, you know, just basic communication between people. You know, kids can come here and play. Mums and dads communicating with each other and building friendships here. When people come in here, there's no you're that tribe or you're that tribe. I know that there's some things that go on in the community with that. But in here, it's a safe environment where people can just come together. And we we take those who have washing machines to take it for granted, you know, that we've got to throw the washing on today, throw the washing on tomorrow. But really in the community, what does that say if you can't share it with someone else? So everybody comes here as a community communicating and friendships. Here is basic kindness, isn't it? Basic kindness to just show someone that they're good. Yeah. Because when you're on the street, like full time and a long time, we find when we go on the street and even here, when's the last time you had a hug? When's the last time someone shook your hand and said, how are you today? You know, we're talking about washing machines, but the whole lot goes together. Dignity, friendship, community, relationship and basic humanitarian kindness and friendship. Yeah. That's it. It all goes together. You can't really have one without the other. And God's for us. I don't know if you're Christian or not, but for us, God is in it all. Because we as especially as teenagers, we felt invisible. We didn't have someone coming past us going, what do you need today? Simple as that. What do you need today? What can we do today or even sit there and listen to you? So we really get the environment here. We don't know all the people, but we get the environment. We're good. We're good. You know, we're going to sit down, we're going to do this, we're going to be in a place where you can sit and talk and need something, you know? It's gold for me, brother. It's gold. I tell you what, just a handshake, a smile, a nod of the head, eye contact, a hug. Spiritual connection, brother, whatever it takes, mate. Like God will just use us for whatever he wants. It's like the congenuity, you know, to be in the vessel just to smile, acknowledge, acknowledgement. It can be everything. Someone can have a terrible day, mate, you don't know what they're going to be doing or what they're planning on doing. what they plan on doing, but a smile, a handshake, a hug, can change their whole pattern on that day, mate. People forget that they're human. They don't know that. If your heart's not working, you're just running on empty and there's nothing, then yep, you're searching out what can I eat, where can I sleep under a cover, but that's not being human. Human is being in community, in communication, and a holistic approach. So that people don't feel like they're invisible. Yeah, I think it's a bit contagious sometimes too when you do have a bit of a connection with whoever it may be and then you've got that smile and a little bit of pick me up where you feel like, wow, that made me feel good. When they go out of here, I think that at least some of those people will take that out with them as well into the community. And maybe their day wasn't looking so bright when they came here, but they've left with a bit of a different attitude about someone just unkind to them. They're not as well-conditionally said hello, smiled or whatever, hugged, and they go back out and then their day can be changed from that. So seeds, take the seeds out there and spread them around and maybe they'll get watered. So yeah, we're just so grateful that God sent us in this direction and so grateful for this place and to see all these beautiful people here sitting out in the sun and everybody's resting. It doesn't solve every problem, but I'm telling you. It's a good feeling. Communication and friendship in this place resolves something. It's an issue of the heart. And you've got to start with that. Yeah. There's definitely movement in the camp, Ben, that's for sure, brother. I tell you what, mate. We've only been here, what, four weeks? Well, been in Kalgoorlie two months, but here three or four weeks. Yeah, this is our fourth time, I think. But we can just see that God's got something moving here. And we're glad that we'll be part of it. And it's like a big puzzle around Kalgoorlie. There's just a lot of people doing things in the background. Even with this interview with yourself, it's a lot of people. And it's just bringing the puzzle together. And we believe there's going to be some powerful stuff happening in Kalgoorlie spiritually. And hopefully what you do here, when you take it out there, it'll go to other places. Yeah. There's money in every community to do this. There's money in every community to do this. And, yeah, hopefully it'll catch. Not just like the washing machines are central to people being clean and having clean clothes and being a part of humanity, that they mean something, that they matter, that so many regional areas, and not just here, Queensland, it doesn't matter where you go, there's a regional area that needs this. Washing machines and dryers are a part of it. If you feel clean on the outside, it doesn't solve all your problems, but I'm telling you now, it cleans something up on the inside. Definitely. Very good. I'm just going to take a couple more pickies. Well done, though. Happy with that, brother? That was amazing.\n",

It's, it's my own little, um, safety. I tend to start things up a lot, so, ah, that, come ahead. That's a good clap. Okay. All right, bro. Just say your full name and spell it first. That's, yeah. So. Uh, Sean Thomas Rogers.\n\nUm, S-H-A-U-N-T-H-O-M-A-S-R-O-G-E-R-S. Amazing. Alright, brothers, tell me a little bit about yourself first. Um, so I started in, um, I, I started in radio. I was gonna do radio. Presenting things like that. Uh, and then I did a course in it and I thought it was, I wasn't patient with all the editing, all that kind of stuff.\n\nUm, so in [00:01:00] another area I was interested in was doing community services, so went and did a course in that. And then, um, after that course, when I moved here from Victoria, I was doing the courses here. Um, I went. Uh, here to do, um, work experience and stuff like that. Cool. Um, but I got employed first and then did the work experience, which was lucky.\n\n'cause it was during covid not many people were offering work experience, so I thought, oh, I'll look for a job and then do the work experience there. And that seemed to work. Yeah. What's, um, what drew you to this type of work? Um, oh, I better, you're right. Yeah. Hello. What's her name? Is she here today? Saba?\n\nUm, she's not here. But what kind, what support you need for sister for assistance? So worries at all. Uh, I can do a 25 for you. That's okay. Um, it's better than nothing here. [00:02:00] Yeah. Um, so today, but um, would you be able to, if you need further, just book an appointment. Oh yeah, that'd be great. Um, just get the front to write it down, uh, your member number down and I'll add it later.\n\nThat's all. Cool. Thank you. Okay, here's this. Gosh, everything's happening. Yeah, it's all good. There we go. All right. Uh, cool. Um, yeah, tell tell me what Drew drew you to this type of work. Um, I, well, I did a lot of volunteering while I was at school, and then, um, I really liked it and I. Thought, oh, you know, if I could live volunteering, I would do that, but you can't obviously go get paid.\n\nMm-hmm. So I guess it came from that kind of thing, so, yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Um, how much the sort of engagement have with Onco? Uh, well it was organized. Oh, so engaged. Yeah. So, um, it was organized I think before [00:03:00] me. Um, but they, yeah, we worked together really well, so, um. You know, if they need charging or they need to put water to drain everything and stuff like that.\n\nMm. And yeah, we often have a chat or when they've got new volunteers, they come and introduce 'em. We do a bit of a tour, um, yeah. And they know a little bit about our services and, and we know a bit about their, so it's, um, no, it's really good. I like the collaborative, 'cause the sector's quite like separated in all different kinds of organizations, so.\n\nIt's nice to have a bit of a collaborative thing going, which is great. Yeah. Right. What's, um, what's the, how many different services do you have here and, and what, what are they? Uh, so we do, so we have the pantry, which is, um, we help with food support so people can, um. Get a lot of groceries very cheaply.\n\nUm, so there's that part of it, [00:04:00] and that just prevents 'em from getting into crisis. And then we have people who are in crisis. They can't afford to get food. Um, they might have other things that they need, so like they, with energy, uh, like energy support, um, they might need to be connected to a whole range of different services.\n\nUm, and need phone charging, a shower, all sorts of things like that. So we do, we do a very practical role and we can also help 'em with food for free as well. So. There's a, a few different kinds of support that we do. Cool. There we go. Oh, hello. Thank you very much. Uh, I'll write that down. So, uh, uh, thank you.\n\nThat's brilliant. Thanks. Thanks very much. Okay. Um, what's the like. Okay. What do you find to be, um, some of the more [00:05:00] impactful, um, services here in terms of like, um, how people are coming in and what you're hearing from people in terms of what the service does for them? Um, we, we get a lot of people who come in, they might have a whole range of problems and then just being able to immediately help 'em with food.\n\nUm, usually they feel a lot better. And then, um, we might have some other things that we're helping 'em with that might take a little longer, like, um, or just get them, um, more information. So the, I think the practical part of it is one of the most important things. 'cause we can sort of take the stress of one or two problems straight away and then they, they can work on the other things as well.\n\nYeah. So. That's the one of the best things. And if they're homeless too, having a shower, um, that's just with hot water and, and things [00:06:00] is like the best, you know? What, um, what role do you think just the connection and conversation has in supporting people more than even like, um, yeah, more than just the food and the showers and stuff.\n\nWhat is that connection do for people, I guess? Oh, um, yeah, really good. Like we get, um, people in here, for example, who. Don't often get to chat to people in their own lives. Um, and so they, they come here and, and they get to know the volunteers and they get to chat with them and, and myself as well. Um, and it's just nice they can come somewhere that's, um.\n\nYou know, they can come somewhere and have a bit of social interaction and things like that. Um, so there's, there's quite a few people who do that. And there's people who also too just need to talk about some of the things they're struggling with and be able to tell [00:07:00] somebody, another person and not just bow little inside.\n\nYeah, yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. So it's, it's, it's great. Yeah. It's. Um, my camera's.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Freddy Wai - Friend - James St\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I'm just basically been homeless , I'm a refugee from Papua Newa. Finally got my Visa last year, May 2nd, 2024. That was 16 days before my birthday, and it was a blessing year. And now I've been living in.\n\nAustralia for six months or something now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's life been like for you, I guess for the last little bit in Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh, I think Australia is the most beautiful country in the world, and I think Melbourne. Yeah, definitely is a beautiful place. Yeah, I've been in two places only that's in.\n\nDanon and Brook, the Sunshine Victoria in Melbourne. And I like it. Yeah, [00:01:00] I like both places. Yeah. But I became homeless just seven weeks ago seven months ago. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's that experience been like for you?\n\nSpeaker 12: It's been challenging and I think it's rewarding too at the same time because I learned a lot of things I lost a lot too.\n\nBut there's a challenging part is losing a lot of friends. You are losing trust in everybody, especially the government. And then you tend to wanna blame and point fingers at, others. But at the end of the day, I think everybody deserves a place to sleep, place access to, water and electricity.\n\nAnd as for me, as a refugee. [00:02:00] Who seek for asylum in here. And I came and I got, they gave me asylum. I think these rights, I have to acknowledge that I need to make myself work harder to find another accommodation for myself. So I have a, shelter and. Electricity, water and all this.\n\nYeah. Otherwise, I'm not a human being, I cannot, I have to work harder to do this. Yeah. To find a house to live in. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 13: What was life like in, in Fiji before you came?\n\nSpeaker 12: Life was very hard. I think it's harder than. It is very difficult, harder than what I've harder than what I've experienced in my life in here.\n\nBut I've seen other people in here [00:03:00] too who are homeless who I think they face it harder than even in my country. I think my country is easier. In here, it's very difficult because it's twofold. You can see the good and the bad, but that's advantage and disadvantage from me leaving my country and from me living in here.\n\nLike in my country, you don't look at the clock. You don't really be punctual in Australia it is different. It's very difficult because the homeless people and all this, they're struggling because why they have to be punctual and pay fees and all these things and all, especially when they don't have job and all this is more difficult.\n\nYeah. But in my country, the only thing is the violence is the scary part. Yeah. The violence is, yeah. [00:04:00] There's no limit. That's the thing. So it's extreme violence. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 13: what made you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Since we got my country got independence from Australia in 1975. After that, only like my parents. They're like citizens of Australia because they were born before we got independence, but they don't get recognized for that. They haven't got a, their citizenship or anything for me. Yes. I was born after 1975. I can get a, I can't get a, passport and all this fight for my rights to come here, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMy parents fight for the right to come here too, and then I fight for my right to come here. It doesn't make sense to me. It is no common sense, but it's all right. God put the law in for some reason. I don't know. We'll work it out later, but I think it's not right. It's not right because if you are born in a country while it's still Australia, [00:05:00] you are a citizen of Australia automatically.\n\nAnd I thought it was only my parents, but I find that, half of the Korean mob and the Torres Strait Islander mob and all the ma everybody, most of the aboriginals, they don't have the citizenship too. So I think we are all in the same boat. So there's nothing to, what was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 13: Why did you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh yeah. Why I came to Australia? Yeah, because I know this this. My mother country, this is my homeland. This is my mother country, so I still have right to come here. But I didn't come. All my family and everybody, they came here before maybe 1997. Even, I don't know if I were, when I was younger, I came, I don't know.\n\nI can't remember because a lot of traveling. Around the country within PNG and here too, but I can't remember most of [00:06:00] it when I was younger. I only, the only thing I can remember is from 1993 up, when I started going to school. Yeah. After that there were a lot of tribal conflicts in my village.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So my parents have been like, they're basically like vol, voluntary workers. They're born again Christians. My father was a heavy diesel equipment fitter, and my mother was a principal at one of the secondary high schools in p and g, and then she became a community office officer for the mining company in my country.\n\nYeah. And she got some more degrees on top of her teaching and all this, and she. Yeah, she's basically the breadwinner of my family.\n\nAs a result, inherited a lot of land [00:07:00] back at home because most of my family, they come and grow up here, so my sister and my brother, and my mother's sister. So because of my land titles, my life is in danger. Because I received land royalties. Yeah. So they want to kill me. I had to take myself out of my country.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm the first born in my male in my country. In my family. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the situation daily for you in Australia now? What's the main things in which you're working on or working towards, or what do you do today?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah the first thing I'm working on is basically to get to know the people.\n\nKnow the system here, the street, the bus service is very difficult because if you grow up here, you can instinctively make decisions like what to do, where to go, what number to go. It is not like that. Every day I wake up to check the number again, [00:08:00] because I'm not sure which bus I'm getting on.\n\nAnd I keep on asking the traffic officers and all this, and the people here are very helpful and very, I think Australia is Australian and the community in Melbourne especially, they're good people. They help a lot. Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 13: Are you using the Sky Service? What do you think of Orange Sky and what they're doing?\n\nSpeaker 12: I think orange sky, I've seen it where in, on TV and all this. And I think I really appreciate the work they do and yeah, I highly recommend the people who fund and support these services. Yeah. God bless you all, like you, you got a heart, heart of gold and I really appreciate your support for the sky orange. People, I'd like to be a volunteer too, to help wash the clothes for like this, but I'm not sure how it's gonna work because that's the only thing. I have. The trolley, if you can take the picture there it [00:09:00] is. Just the trolley there. Yeah.\n\nThat's my only problem because\n\nI never been in Australia, homeless in winter, but summer is all right. That's why I take a lot of clothes there in there. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 13: And what's why do you think like this idea of connection and being able to talk to people is important?\n\nThat's part of what Orange sky does. Why is, why do humans need other people and other people to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think because it's very lonely world for me. For me, I think I'm lonely. I'm lonely maybe because. I enjoy other things and all this. Maybe I'm not I don't have a partner, that's why I'm lonely or something.\n\nBut I'm straight just for information looking for a girl. I have some of my partner ex-partners back in p and g, but since I come here, I have to start a new life, but it's very difficult for me. I can't get over it. Yeah. Like starting a new life here. Yeah. Yeah, I still have [00:10:00] my family back at home.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's like some things in which you do to connect with people in Australia\n\nSpeaker 12: In Australia, basically, I just most of the time I just say hello to people, meet them on the road. But sometimes I drink drink alcohol once in a while, and when I drink, I feel more open to speak to people and yeah, I meet a lot of people here.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 13: do you meet a lot of other people that are not from Australia and do you connect in that way as well or do you make most\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I meet a lot of people not from Australia and Yeah. But I'm very curious about the, how the real Australian, like how the Australians are. The culture and all this, how they speak and all this.\n\nI try to follow, learn the accent, the lingo. But I think if they speak in the ling the slangs I don't understand. They, I seen a lot of, when they get to the, they start using [00:11:00] the slangs and all this, they know. Yeah. And it's a different level. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it, but I understand.\n\nYeah, I understand. That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the next sort of steps for you? What do you wanna do next?\n\nSpeaker 12: The next step for me is after I understand the system, I'm gonna be like, five years. Five years I won't work because that's, I promise that already, because five years, actually seven years I fight for my visa, and finally after seven years, I got it.\n\nSo seven years I will stay. I am like a, a baby, newborn baby. I'm still growing. When I become seven years old, I will understand what to do and then I will start working there.\n\nYeah. I will start working after seven years, but now I'm so mentally tormented because I've been institutionalized and I tried working.\n\nI was working with the [00:12:00] brick laying and all these things. I just walk one day. Yeah. But I couldn't I'm a process technician. Even just fixing a bicycle. I can't do it. I try to change the wheel, change that tube. I can't do it because I can't concentrate. It takes like over two to three hours just changing the tire.\n\nSo I've been mentally affected too. Yeah. I got stabbed here. Two times here. Two times here, two times here. I'm a victim of one punch coward assault. Yeah. They punched me here too. And I fell down. Actually I was on the balcony and they punched me and I fell down because I was dead drunk, so I fell down and the cement broke my jaw.\n\nI got four screws here. Four screws. Yeah. Yes. From my fractured jaw. And then I got hit by a, I got hit by a [00:13:00] car. It's like it was lady, she stopped by the traffic light. I was coming on a bike trying to go and do a inspection. House inspection. Yeah. I come and then there was green light was on. And then she stopped.\n\nAll the cars went and she stopped. And so I took off. When I took off, she took off again and she hit me again. And then she hit me. I went to the air five meters up, landed on my head, bro. Yeah, to my ligament, spine, ligament. And then what happened was the police come to question me, take me to the hospital in all.\n\nI said no, it's all right. It's not her because she was a Muslim lady. She just pick her children and she was crying too. So I feel sorry. Like I said, no she didn't do anything. And then I woke up and I went to the hospital myself. Yeah. And that's another that's the third incident I got.[00:14:00]\n\nSo I got a lot of injuries when I came to Australia too. Yeah. Yeah. What's, what other\n\nSpeaker 13: services do you use at the moment? What are the types of things in which,\n\nSpeaker 12: I use the sender link. I use the Salvation Army, I use the library for shower, and whenever I want to do a like con. Do internet, like search some things.\n\nFree wifi. I go to the library. I even use the console wifi sometimes when I don't have data. What else do I use? I use the bus services and the train services. Most of the times I don't have the, my key, but I think the officers I used to miss understand. But they're really there to help me. Yeah.\n\nI think. Yeah. Yeah. What,\n\nSpeaker 13: and what other things do you think would be helpful for you if someone was to be able to support? What are Yeah. Are most [00:15:00] important?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think I would need support to, at least get a job. I really need support to get a job and a house like I'm mentally affected.\n\nI had a mental, independent, psych mental health psych assessment by a doctor, and he found out that I was mentally impaired and he is put a no enough in claim for my compensation. And he says, admit that, but I don't want the money because I don't know how to budget because mentally affected, I can't even work.\n\nBecause I get paranoid, I don't trust anybody. I don't even trust myself. The only thing I trust is I'm praying to God every night or something to gimme some, yeah. But yeah, sometimes I go crazy. Yeah, I try to take things in my own hands, but in my heart I know what is against my religion and I try not to do it.\n\nDo [00:16:00] it a lot, get angry at someone or get violent or something like that is no good. And I'm trying to learn how to live here. Yeah. But it's overwhelming because the culture shock. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it'll be all good. Yeah. Thanks to people like you and the Orange Sky team and all this, I think we are blessed to have, people who do this work and who support us like this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Done.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. All right. We're gonna do.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# David - The Farm\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n\\*\\*David:\\*\\* Show. \n\nThis is Duckys Farm, and this is a service that we are providing since two years ago now for people with learning disabilities. Why do this why get the farm? What's the vision? Wow. To be honest I fell in love.\n\n\\*\\*David:\\*\\* You can see this. I fell in love when I first visited the the residential part and and I saw the potential straight away because everything we can do here, enterprises, people working and having a purpose in life, that was the reason to do it.\n\nIt's, to be honest, it was difficult in terms of the change of culture. I thought I grew up in Spain, then I thought that everything was going to be easier. I think I had a few, lots of mistakes where I learned from the main thing is to recruit the correct people to deliver the ethos and to deliver the, yeah, our our [00:01:00] philosophy.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you work with. The profile of the people we look after, it doesn't matter if there are young people who offended or people who had or has learning disabilities or people, I dunno, asylum seek. It doesn't matter. What we do is to to to to know them and to fulfill their needs.\n\nFull stop. And that is, and we do it through. Main or common thing that you've seen in Spain and here is the relationship is how good are the member staff, how engaged, how everybody has a purpose, how there is no, no one person doing nothing. There is always lot of people active and that is the idea that I think our welfare.\n\nQuality of life, improve where the more active you are. And that is something about it and more if we are linking this with nature, where all we all come from and that brings us a different way to do things.\n\nI [00:02:00] think people knows us mostly in the justice system. I think people get surprised when I explain all the services, care services that we run and, and I think as soon as there are some some people believing and giving us a trial of doing things that will flourish is at the beginning they will see us like, oh, those people coming from Europe, uk, what are they going to. Teach us, and we don't want to teach anything. The only thing we want is to deliver services in a different way.\n\nIt's not that teaching or it's not it's just about not doing what everybody's doing because that doesn't work. It doesn't work to have people with learn disability sitting down, just passing days and days watching tv, dribbling and so on. No it's doing this or what you saw in Spain.\n\nAgain, different profile, but what you saw is people engaged doing [00:03:00] doing some, a lot of activities and don't be bored. And at the end, what you are going to see across the whole, the gramma is improving quality of life of all the people. And that is what we want to do in Australia. I think, what I understand more from Australia is the Justice, youth Justice system.\n\nAnd I think we could yeah, we could do amazing things, which is going to improve not just the kids that we are going to be looking after, but also the community, the STEM community and not, I'm not even going through their community. I'm speaking about how good it will be not having people re-offending.\n\nHow people will feel safer how the taxpayer's money will drop down. And that is always a nice thing to have. \n\nHow much you can do, but, and how much good you can do. This is something that we've done in both countries. In fact, we just compete with quality. We just focusing, giving the [00:04:00] best quality service to the people we look after and everything comes together. I. We don't have a big team.\n\nThe bid team I have is all the managers who knows how to do things. And I can show how we do it. That is more about how we are competition in the u well, in the UK or in Australia. They don't know how to look after people in custody. That is we don't have competition there. Our competitors in the UK.\n\nIs big for profit companies who are more in entitled to to deliver this type of service in Australia. It's just a public sector. Public sector doesn't know how to run it. I don't need to be very clever to see the read the news are the competition for me doesn't exist. And later I think there is a.\n\nI think you saw that in Spain where [00:05:00] some other charities come to us and we work in collaboration because we are not doing everything. We need each other as a community for running our services and we rely a lot in in other charities to deliver what we deliver. The good relationship with other charities that is imperative. If someone is having a better service than us, we will rely on them. And we have no problem to be humble and say, you are better than me. Can you deliver this for me? And likewise, we can do the some services for them. \n\nWe have experience because that doesn't, it wasn't like that when we started in Spain. It's something that, it's not that we did it, it's something that we were part of it. And is very clear is all the stakeholders.\n\nAnd we as the deliver of the service provider, we need to sit down and we need to say, what is our objective here? Our objective is [00:06:00] integrating people in the community. Okay. Then it doesn't work. Comp not compete. 'cause it's not competition. It's blaming each other. The blaming culture of covering their asses and so on is something that.\n\nIt shouldn't be like that. The focus should be just working with these kids and providing the best service, the best quality service from all the angles. It's not the court blaming the police blaming the government or local authority the department blaming each other. That doesn't work.\n\nThat is having. Your parents, they don't speak each other or they argue with each other. Instead of being, focusing how to grow these kids that happen in families. When we say that some families come from very broken families, yeah. They come from broken families. The system is broken.\n\nThat is what happened. It is mom and dad doesn't speak with each other. They argue with each other. They blaming each other. And that is what we need to sit down and understand [00:07:00] that we need to do the best and focus in the people we look after. That's all. \n\nI think it will. It will, as you can imagine turning that, culture around is going to take time. It's not going to be by next month, it's going to take years. But we need to start by maybe doing mediation between all of us and say, okay, this is not working. Should we start from scratch? And finding the humble people from government, civil servant politicians, and say, yeah.\n\nCan we learn something? Can we do something about this? And that's it. Any other message that you think you haven't said on video that you wanna be able to say from Australian perspective or, I think I mean everything you are seeing here or in Spain come from a long period of time thinking and failing and learning.[00:08:00] \n\nAnd improving. Don't think that there, I will take like a short period of time. It's going to take time, but not as long as 31 years, that is what we have done in Spain or here we've been 16 years. But if we give a push, it's something that this philosophy, this way of working can be done in Australia.\n\nI have no doubt about that. Let's start, and I think we are, yeah let's do it right. This is the most beautiful.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "A bit of like rough behind the scenes type bit of action going on. Do we look like rough people or something? Is that, don't I? Righto brother, just your name, tell us your full name and spell it, it'd be great. Brett Klump, you know Brett Klump, K-L-U-M-P-P. Come here, tell us a bit about Brett Klump, who are you, what are you doing here? I'm here volunteering, helping out our friends, it's all just giving back, helping people who just need help and it's just yeah, good group of people sharing time. Tell us a bit about your role and how you got into it I guess. I'm the team leader with the role, I just, joining Orange Sky, I joined probably just right at the start of COVID or just before, just before COVID. I was just finished, all my volunteering was with the kids and sport growing up and now growing up and then I just wanted something else to do, I looked around and heard about Orange Sky, seemed like a great opportunity to join that. Um, then with the team leader, the other team leader just said to me they didn't want to do it, am I interested, everyone stepped back, so I stepped forward. But no, I enjoyed it, it's quite easy job to do, it's a good group but we all run it, just all together, it's all, everyone shares an opinion, gives ideas and we go from there. What's the vibe like here with all the people that come and the connections, conversations, how do you feel about it? No, it's good, it's a good area, it's like we're always, and like I keep warning the team, and I did just sing earlier. Um, you know, it's a good area, it's a good area, it's a good area, you've got to be wary that any situation can happen any time, it's always been safe here, we had a couple just might have raised a voice and we just have to calm down, there's been a couple of knife instances around with the meals, they haven't been around here and they've been sorted but it's always seemed safe, we're always on alert, but friends we have coming, we have a chat, we have other friends who come just for chats because we start here, you know, an hour before the meal starts, so they'll come and just sit with us and have a chat and catch up and we'll just keep going. I've been very thankful for that. Yeah, it's a good group of people. That's cool man. Um, there's a relationship with the church, how's that work and what's the benefit? Oh, very good relationship with them, we help them out, um, they'll put on a Christmas lunch for all the friends at Christmas time over in the Cathedral, um, ended up, because we do that, we're our chief carver, I have to carve the ham every year for them, um, we run a barbecue here, every about two or three times a year, the relationship, yeah, works well, we're going to talk with them, but I think they're the best. I think they're the best, they're the best. They talk with us just to share things. They have all the kids help out. They'll bring the kids around to have a look what's going on with us and they'll learn about Orange Sky as well. But yeah, no, they're a good group of people. That's cool, man. Tell us a little bit about what you get out of this and why you keep coming back, I guess. The people I'm here with, volunteering with, they're a good group of people. We all get along. The friends just hearing different stories. That's just interesting to hear the stories. It's sad as well how they've got to be in the situations they're in at times. There's the others who aren't keen on sharing stories, which is fair enough. They don't have to. I don't know. I just feel good. Whenever I come in here, I go home, I always feel good when I go home. I might be hungry or a bit tired, but you just feel good. It's just a good feeling to be out helping people who need help. Some people are kind of on the fence with volunteering. They want to do it, not sure. What would you say to them about why just give it a crack? What's the reason? Just give it a crack. It's easy. You can always give it a crack and then decide, no, it's not for me. So always just give it one go. But even if you volunteer, might try it here and go, no, that's not for me. I want to do something else. Go try somewhere else. Just try different places. There's lots of different opportunities out there, different things. I think everyone will find something for them in volunteering, no matter where it is. Cool, man. Mate, you smashed it. Yeah.\n",

But just wanted to open up the discussion and again, provide a safe space. Like how did that feel?\n\nNo different than any other day. Yeah. I think I overheard not to dive into it like this feels a bit. Silly or stupid, like we're meant to come here to talk. Tell me a little bit more around why the silence feels uncomfortable. Probably the main thing, I think that the silence is that we're getting, we're trying to bring people out of their homes where there's probably silence.\n\nParticularly if someone's living on their own, don't have a spout. They'll sit there in silence a lot. Whereas coming here we talk and we talk about whatever and sometimes you can have, if everyone in their little groups, [00:01:00] if it's not a full table of conversation will stop and you'll have, probably 30 seconds or maybe a minute of silence and to think what's going on.\n\nWe've all just run out at the one time whether you're talking about the weather or whether we're talking about finance or whatever it is, everyone stops at once and that's what I feel uncomfortable about in that. What do we do to kick it off again? Yeah, that's my thoughts from silence.\n\nYeah. Cool. Thank you for sharing that Bernie and that's the, probably the power of Tom net, right? It's bringing conversation and connection. Yes. So for the people that were able to find an artifact around what Tom Net means to you wanna put you on the spot here, but you went straight to this picture.\n\nDo you wanna Yeah. Talk about the picture? Yeah, I do. Mainly because this particular photo shows a chap who's not with us any longer and all of us will remember him. And you may have heard about the chap that was at Grand Central here in town that was killed, the old fell [00:02:00] was pushed over by a young fella and he died a couple of days later.\n\nLes Robert, and that's him there. And this group sitting around was one of the early we're going up today to the bowls club and it's lunch with makes, it's what we call it. And and anyone can. Participate, just go up there, have a meal, sit around like we are now, and have a bit of a talk.\n\nAnd that photo was taken, I think at the the new hotel in town and there's only four, four guys there that day. But, and some days there is only four, but mostly there'd be 10 or 12, something like that. Yeah, so I, I dunno why I grabbed that, but just the fact that I knew Robert fairly well and most of the guys here did.\n\nAnd his brother incidentally you'd remember his brother can't even think of his name now. It should. He's still in a home and he's been there for at least 10, 10 or 12 years at Signs thought Tyrell. [00:03:00] Remember Terrell? You'd remember Terrell. You remember Terrell. Anyway thank you for sharing that.\n\nDid anyone else. Find an artifact that spoke to them. I think you got a book off the shelf. Ken? Yes. I got this book off the shelf because I like reading and I like reading murder mysteries. And this girl writes very good murder mysteries and I just saw it there and I thought, we've got a little library here, just a little library with a dozen or so books there.\n\nAnd this is where all the guys, if they want to read a book, they come down here. Grab a book. But I just thought that's something that I love doing at home. I love sitting down for an hour or so and reading a book of a morning or an afternoon or whenever my wife and kids are away, I sit down in the quiet and read a book.\n\nThat's when I haven't got things to do outside, which is always the case. No. Yes. [00:04:00] That's the reason I picked this. The Tom Net library. Yeah, the Tom Net library. Yeah, that's right. Did anyone else choose a, an artifact or, yeah, I grabbed a cup of coffee if I'm you here. There's only my second day.\n\nBut the reason I came here is I've got a wife and we talk all the time and we live a good life together. But I miss that conversation between, especially people, my age group, especially men. I don't get that anywhere else. So cup of coffee and a talk. It was really important to me.\n\nI picked up the F pledge. It's always, I think I've been involved with Dominic for a good one 10 more years ago. And it's just the wording of it, whoever, and this was put together by guys who. We started the organization of meeting in, [00:05:00] they used to meet with their wives and then that wasn't working, so they guys said they wouldn't let it go.\n\nI just forget the name of those guys. They held onto it and it just the wording of it for me has always been what? Tom that's about of living, learning, loving daring and hoping. And I think one of the big ones is that growing and changing. Because even then, if we're in our our years I know that I'm 80 in the eighties now, I'll be 80.\n\n85 this year. That it is a challenge to keep growing. And I think that's the thing that Tom left. It encourages people, guys to keep growing, look out away from themselves. No. So [00:06:00] then that was written, oh, I can't think of me. Yeah, I wouldn't really know who it was, but was the original guide that started off was combined group of men and women.\n\nThen it went to just the men and they put all this together and as long as I've been associated with, that's been, again, a great thing. It means so much of life. It's and that's what Tom makes. You might get here once a month. You might get here ready. Every week in the month, but I've never felt an outsider the whole time I've been here.\n\nThanks for saying John. I like to say a word. I'm only 67. Yeah, i'll be the youngest out. All of these. He's, the thing I've found is like we can talk about everything. Like I'm, a lot of young people don't want to talk. [00:07:00] They just talk, excuse the special lot of. Bullshit and that, but I've learned a lot of things from you guys while I've been here.\n\nSo you gotta talk to everybody, not sit you. Oh, you are old, you are too old. And it doesn't affect me at all, but I just think, please charge. That's my saying about it. Please charge your battery. Didn't charge it, did you? We need.\n\nAnyone else choose any? Did you also, did John, both Johns choose the pledge? Yes. I were being involved with in away for over 20 years because I was gun to windy and they had the gun to Windy grays there. And I was sent to a meeting when, more or less, when Tom Net was starting up about 25 years ago.\n\nAnd. Then of course, until [00:08:00] I come here, I didn't come here till 2019 and then I joined in the 2020, I think it was July 21. And I with the gun to Wendy Graves I was constantly driving a bus. They could hire from PCYC to take chaps on under windy grays on bus trips to miles, the heritage center out there, common Co and different things.\n\nAnd of course I've been. Involved with a number of organizations all my life. I can remember going out there at Governor. Yeah. And also, no great days we have to get,\n\ndid anyone else have any artifacts or maybe something [00:09:00] mentally they thought of when when they're thinking about one object to. That talks to them about what Tom net is.\n\nIt's all about, it's all about a bunch of men getting together and having the yard. That's what it's all about. Very simple. And what's, why is that important? Just to comely, I think, and get to know more farmers. If you, I've been coming to Tom net now for 10 years or more, probably closer to 15. And every man in this room has got a story to tell because we've been through life.\n\nI'm not picking on you two guys 'cause you're young, thank you. One of these days you'll get to the stage where you'll look back on your life and you'll meet. It's like I, I struggle to. Communicate with my sons who are one's [00:10:00] just turned 40 and one's 41. I don't get involved in, they've just come back from a week at Fraser Island.\n\nAnd I said how was it? Oh, it was great. Dad didn't get invited, but I took them there when they were only little fellas. So as we get older, we tend to probably a bit like when you are younger you tend to. And congregate together with your own age group. And this is what we're doing here.\n\nAnd as somebody said, you can sit at home for hours and hours on your own, but come here and you can sit and talk and tell maybe a few lies, even not big ones, but jeez, it must have been fairly big. If it's paperwork me, truck driving mine is good. And then that is that one, and then you, anyone, and then me is just ri around.[00:11:00] \n\nIt's just that's, I don't know. It is just there, but around and around. I just, yeah I can, I know, but I can't. Yeah, much. That's, it's a good out there for you, Dave, isn't it? Yeah. That's it, yeah. I can go in there, but I can't think\n\nover a counselor for 12 years and again, became a council and one thing I have seen, and it's most important. For Tom Mnet is the fact I've seen it. People retire they stay in the house and that, and they go downhill fast. Oh yeah. And this is where Mnet is playing an important [00:12:00] role for men to get out and meet with other men.\n\nWell said. John, you're rolling. Yeah. Very much. Amazing. One, one thing I was really inspired by was when. I heard a couple of things and about what Tom that were doing, and there was just the type of giving back that you still do as you come together to support others. But then I think some of that energy you give back is really interesting.\n\nDoes anyone have a reflection of the stuff you Yeah most of the conversation's been about coming here into the center. That, that's only the beginning really. Once, once you. Get to know people here. We then, go out into different areas and we've got a couple of barbecue teams where we do barbecues for charity groups and things like that.\n\nSo that involves people going from here out, into, and into the open. Same with nursing homes, the fellows here there'll be two or three go to a particular nursing home [00:13:00] each month. So pretty well every nursing home in Toowoomba is covered by Tom Net Fellows going and talking to the immobile people that have to come from their beds or that are in wheelchairs and things like that can't access here.\n\nSo we've got that volunteering exercise. There's a lot of volunteering opportunities with Tom met in that. We've got people that mentor at the flexi school. The flexi school here is a. For school, for probably wayward students that don't fit the normal school curriculum. So they, have all the piercings and dy hairs and so forth like that.\n\nBut they, we have people that mentor those students one-on-one for the years, 10, 11, and 12. And they bring them out and help them get from, a broken home or a. In a strange sort of home. And that's important and that's where we do work outside. But there is a lot we have [00:14:00] drivers at the PCYC to, to break the cycle, kids getting their a hundred hours up using PCYC cars and that sort of stuff.\n\nThey don't have access to a car other than going to somewhere like that. So we do that sort of work, but, there is a lot of volunteering and that gets people not just coming here for a session, but doing an extra shift or a few hours somewhere else. I think that's important as well. That's amazing.\n\nIs there any other sort of highlights of giving that you guys have shared of for us at a moment? I not wanting to hold the four, but many years ago when I joined Mnet we had a thing called the Min, the minstrels, which was four. Four of us mu we call ourselves musicians, and we'd go around to the nursing camp and and I can remember the first day I can still see it as if it happened an hour ago.\n\nI went to a place here called Science th which is a nursing home. And there was a lady, they wheeled her out [00:15:00] in a wheelchair and she had her head down and she was obviously, asleep or whatever, and she had a walking stick. And I thought, I dunno how I'm gonna handle this with all these people that were.\n\nNot not very well in that. And anyway, as soon as we started to sing, this lady started tapping the floor with the walking stick. She still had her head down, but the up here was working. The body was gone, uhhuh, but the mind was there. And from that day on, I got so much outta that I got, I get more back.\n\nAnd to this day, two of the, whether it was a foursome, two of those guys are in care themselves now. But we've carried on and and I must say that I get more out of that. Then than I think I hear. But anyway, that's just one of the things we do that we hope that helps other people.\n\nWho else? Tell me this. How many of you come us here blokes? And how many obvious are [00:16:00] guys? It's one of them. Pet, HCH guys. He hates the word guys. Yes. He hates the word guys. I haven't used it. I don't think like that this morning. Have I used it this morning? No, I don't think so. I spent two years in Canada a long time ago, and then two years in America.\n\nWe, you're a guy over there, but lately over here it's been guys everywhere. Not me, I'm a bloke. He's marriage of American, the go places, shopping centers and sort of thing in particular. And you might have your wife with you and the staff will say, can I help you guys? You referring to me as the guy and my wife is a guy.\n\nThere's a bit of a difference that's just the way the younger one seemed to, to go with it. Yeah, and that probably comes from media, right?\n\nI go shopping with my wife and I help her do it. There's nothing wrong with her, but I help it. But yeah I find some of the older people, they [00:17:00] pick up something like that and they look at it and, they can't read it. So I'd stand there and read it to them. Yeah. Yeah. All the printing on all those things.\n\nAnd even if you buy something that you need to go home and cook. You need a bloody magnifying glass to That's right. Read the printing is getting so small on instructions and particularly what the ingredients are in the product. And I can see they probably don't want you to know too much about what's in it, so they make that small.\n\nBut the instruction on how to handle it, how to cook it and process is more important I think in that people need to cook chicken until it's properly cooked, not just until it looks cooked. That's right. Yeah. So we, timing and that sort of thing's important, but it's all getting very much smaller.\n\nBut anyway, it could be that, that our eyes are getting weaker too. I'm not gonna say that because I agree with you a hundred percent. Just recently, I bought a little magnifying glass for that. Your problem there is you've [00:18:00] gotta go and get your glasses adjusted. Sorry about that. I love this word in the pledge around learning.\n\nAnd so be interested to hear, around the table maybe something that Tom Net has taught you, or I guess what you've learned, throughout being a part of Tom Net.\n\nI just find a difference between my age and your age. At least we can talk to each other now because yes, we have got different ways we talk, but you've just gotta work out how to do it. So you all understand that.\n\nI think I. By coming to time that, oh, it's about 12 years now. But I found there's a lot of people you can understand because they've had similar lives to you. I found like earlier in the [00:19:00] piece, there were a lot of fellows from out west Country, Tomba. Some had gone to the coast, found. The coast just wasn't their piece because they were so used to leaving in the country.\n\nThey chose, and I found with Tom that you've got all types but fellows off the land, there are fellows that lived in the town, have different ideas, and you learn from them because like in the country you just get involved with what you're doing. I started off when I left school, was a motor mechanic.\n\nI did 10 years at that until dad had a stroke and took over the dairy farm. While I've been dairy farming since 19, 19 60 I think it is. And we had a dairy farm which belonged to the grandfather. His grandfather was passed on down. We had to sell it because Brisbane just went over the top of us.\n\nBut buying a dairy farm out here, I was able [00:20:00] to associate with neighbors because they were, had similar ways that we had and, but coming to Tom now, I found here there were fellows come from the West as fellows from Toowoomba. There's other fellows from Ka other areas and you got to know what they do in their to.\n\nThe younger days and that sort of thing. And whereas if you're in the country, that's all you know is people that have associated with that type of whatever you did. And coming here was virtually an eye eyeopener to me because I didn't have any idea what town people were like and. Other people have had different ideas come from other states and all that, and I found talking to them I learned a lot since I've come here of what other people have done in [00:21:00] their life and no matter who they are, what they are, what they've done, I just become interested in it. Would you And like a bit public one, the first I met here he used to have a dairy farm until he went to. I used to did jobs on your farm, didn't I? Yeah, some sort. Yeah. And you me fellas that you've met before and lost for years, but I think it's broadened my mind because, you're daring and that's what, even though I was a mechanic.\n\nI was able to do all my own work on the retractors, and God knows what, save a lot of money. But by coming here all, they're all different. What do you say? Breeds or what they've done. And I've learned a lot by coming here from the fellows who who I would've never, ever met. And I, i've en, en enjoyed the whole time at time. Now [00:22:00] it's it's just one of those things that no matter who they are, they talk to you and they'll tell you about what they did their younger day. And you listen because you didn't know that. And I, and I told years, I suppose I've been, I've enjoyed it and only time I've missed you was, probably my wife died only a few months ago, and I found it was real comfortable coming here and talking to fellas that that had probably a similar life to what I've had. But no can I just tell these two young fellas that Bill is probably the oldest one here? We just, we think we decided that earlier today, so Bill's in his nineties.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah and he's still got more hair than everyone else. I'll never forget, this is a couple months ago I was sitting here and they were talking about losing hair and all this sort. I looked around the table, I [00:23:00] think there was 12 or 13 of us here, and I was the only one that had hair on his head.\n\nI felt young. I think I've got hair on. You're a lot younger than Bill.\n\nAh, yes. But yes. It's been great comfort when you come here that you, your WI fellows who you understand and they understand you. It's like what Bill's saying, I would've probably never come across Bill again. And we had a good working association when I was working and I visit his farm, do a job, something like that.\n\nAnd I may have never come across him again if I hadn't to come here or vice versa.\n\nIs there anything else that people have learned through being a part of Tom? Some powerful.[00:24:00] \n\nI got a couple more, more questions. If I may like one, one is, like I said, I like the F word, which is friend. I guess what does friendship look like at tom net? What have maybe been some of those friendships that you've made or what have been, like, what does, what's the feeling of friendship at that tom net builds or provides, or what does friendship look like at.\n\nSorry. I'll have to leave you. Bye, John. John. Hey Ron to meet you. Yeah, glad to meet. Good luck you. Good luck\n\nto your question. I think we are just like that. Respect each other, as simple as that. Irrespective of what they did or what I did, that was our life and I respect of what they.\n\nAnd you can always get advice from someone that we've got a broad cross section of the [00:25:00] community from barristers and magistrates and school teachers and school principals and train drivers and dairy farmers and weed farmers. You've got everybody. And we did have an accountant, we had a couple of accountants unfortunately who lost them last year, but you can ask them something.\n\nAnd get some information directly from what they've been involved with. And I think that, that's a good thing as far as friendship is concerned, but also you get people that will offer to help and do something. And that, that's also a good thing. And that's what happens, I think with the volunteering is that people will get in and you won.\n\nYou've only gotta say I've only got two going to this barbecue. We need. Three or four more, then hands will come up and they'll come and help. And it's that, that's good too for the for getting out. So on that's brings the friendship and the assistance that you can get from knowing other people's life careers and so on.[00:26:00] \n\nI think the interesting thing is that we've all been through life. Whatever. And the younger generation, and I include you both, you guys, both you blokes, sorry. It's honor to be called a bloke, but you don't experience that until you reach a certain age. And I suppose retirement is probably the age.\n\nSome of us retire earlier than others. I've got a friend of mine as well in his eighties and he still works. Him five days a week, and I think if he gave up work, that'd be the end of him. But anyway, that's we're all different. So that, that's the difference I think is that we never, I certainly never experienced this sort of comradery or friendship when I was younger.\n\nWe probably had friends that we worked with or in our workplace or whatever, but this is a whole group of guys from all sorts of backgrounds, from everywhere.[00:27:00] \n\nAnyway. Yeah I, the friendship, here is different. I was a in jcs, I was in a, I was Lions in various a couple of different towns. I was quite involved in Lions clubs and so forth. But that, that's a different sort of you, it's different purpose I think in that.\n\nYou you're still working. You've got your own family that you've gotta look after and so forth to get to this point. Our family in 99% of the cases are all self-sufficient, so you're still keeping contact but you're not nurturing like we used to be early. So retirement is different in that regard and that's where I think retirement can become very lonely.\n\nI found that when I. Finished work. I I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 60 and I said to my kids, I'll retire at 65 if I'm still alive, or when that time came, I said I can't do it. I'm not ready. So I worked till I was [00:28:00] 73 and the day I walked away from the probably 80 staff that we had working I think what do you do now?\n\nMy wife has said, before you retire, you need to clean the shed up. I go up to the shed after I'd retired and I found it very depressing to go in there and have things that I knew I wouldn't use again. And I said to my grandson a little while ago, after 30 years in hardware, I had pretty well every tool that was manufactured 'cause you'd take one home to try it.\n\nI said, look, all those power tools here, I said, you can take your pick from all 'em and. He just looked at me and said, they're no good to me, pop. I said, why not? He said They've got cords on them. Oh yeah. I'll get the same from, it's the next generation now is that they only want cordless tools. Yeah. And I see the convenience in cordless tools because they, some of them are lending me things that are just grab and go.\n\nYou don't have to run the court. You've got the job done before, before you've run the court. But yeah, it's different from that perspective. I [00:29:00] think, see the other thing, all of us worked all our life and what there a dozen of us here and there wouldn't be how would I say? Two people had done the same thing as out of the dozens of here.\n\nBill's the only followed that I know that was associated with dairy, you got? Good question. No one here had done the work I was doing, which was repairing machinery and traveling all over the district, like the furthest I went to do a job with Bendigo, so you know, I got about a little bit. Yeah, that's a fair way. Yeah, fair hike. Yeah. And then you've got Neeva over there.\n\nHe's a plum. So if you need plumbing work, what do I done wrong? Now turn your hearing aids up. And so a question I've got, like we've got this opportunity to, make more people aware of Tom Ned. What's your hopes for Tom net? Do [00:30:00] you hope that, you know what, yeah, what are your hopes for Tom Net?\n\nThat it keeps going and more people come into it. Yeah. That's the only hope. I think we need somewhere for old people to go. Yeah. And I guess to make more people aware, like what have you found as a successful way to explain to or to encourage fellow blokes to come? One of the problems we have, and I say problems, I don't know if that's the right word, is to.\n\nThe, and I always say to people that the hardest thing is to walk through that door the first time. Yeah. Would you say that right, Gordon? Yeah. Because as a bloke that's come here because you've heard of things and you open that door and you walk in here and here's all these 10 or 12 or maybe only half a dozen people, albeit your age group, but still [00:31:00] strangers.\n\nAnd Greg's only just joined us, so I don't know. I'm only talking for myself, but that's, that would be the hardest thing is that first tough time. Saturday we had a barbecue at the local hardware store. What we get, two of them Greg was there. Greg. Greg came along to that and was talking to one of our members about Dom been to us, and that was on Saturday.\n\nTurns up on Monday, and there again. On Thursday, so Yeah. But it's talking to people and explaining and although it's a men only thing the women to get the husband outta the house and they're often at expos and so forth. You'll be more involved in speaking to a woman about her husband that's sitting at home.\n\nYeah. And she'll go home and give you a bit of a shove out the door so that, that works in spreading Tom. That, but but it's been going for 25 years. It's continually growing. It has spread out the Okie there's a branch out there that they've celebrated 20 years last year. [00:32:00] Crow's Nest is the same.\n\nThey've just started down in the Laier Valley, Gatten Plain Land and Laly. It is spreading. And most, people are seeing the need for. For older men, a lot of things for women CWAs and church sewing groups and various things like that. But there's not a lot for men. Men only that is.\n\nYeah. And we, we can involve wise as much as little as you want. It can involve wives in volunteering. Yeah. If you've got a couple of people, go at the mentoring at the Flexi school. We've got a husband and his wife goes as well. He can do that but this is wholly ground in here that they don't come.\n\nAnyway. One of the things we're thinking about is like creating something to get more people here and we can obviously make some videos and put some photos on the website and, do different flyers. But I think like you. You all [00:33:00] know best how to I guess tell people the tom net story and get people here and I think never underestimate the power of, what happened at the barbecue that power of, seeing a, another human advocate for something and have the courage to, to be here.\n\nBut we'll try our best to go on a journey with you all and, and try to, yeah, capture something that's super or record rather something that's super profound. Yeah, like I said, this afternoon we'll have a bit of opportunity one-on-one to have a bit of a chat. We have the world's smallest camera.\n\nI used to work at Channel seven and this is now showing my age 21. When I was 18 and had red P plates, and I came to Toowoomba a few times, mainly for bad things happening, like someone at court or. A truck crash or something like that. And I feel now like this little bit inside me where like I was quite weak and chubby and carrying this like 30 kilo camera on your shoulder, running after politicians and whatnot.\n\nAnd now this is the camera that does a better job, which [00:34:00] you could pick up with your pinky. And could. Could they almost, carry a hundred of those to the camera. And that's the camera that we'll be using and having a bit of a chat, but it'll be one-on-one and super voluntary and that sort of thing.\n\nSo we'll do that afternoon, we'll come to lunch. But definitely let the team know here. I think if there's a moment that really, inspires you about Tom net, like if you are going to play music or you are, about to go to the flexi school and you really want that story told.\n\nDefinitely let the team know here because we'd love to come and help you tell that story. And one of the things I was just thinking about, if people are comfortable just picking up on that note around the hardest thing is coming through that door. I think that's a very symbolic moment of courage, but also it's something that's very grounding that, we've spoken about us all coming from different backgrounds, different ages, but today the one thing apart from.\n\nEveryone having a great conversation that we've all done, which is exactly the same, is go through that door. We'd love to I don't think there's any actors around the table over there. You've got every other [00:35:00] skill. It would be nice to get some shots of people coming in and out of that door.\n\nBut Ben's a an incredible photographer. No, Nick's really got a talking rubbish. No. So I, I was just thinking it might be nice just to get some. Some portraits of you all coming through that door. And we'll again, share them all, all with you. But it maybe is worthwhile thinking about maybe we can make like a postcard or an invitation with, your portrait on it.\n\nBut then maybe write that invitation to someone who wants to join Tom net. That maybe we can place in places like those, nursing homes or where you think people are maybe needing a little bit of encouragement to walk through that door in saying, you've all done it is probably hard the first time.\n\nMaybe still a little bit hard, but actually giving someone some encouragement to come through this door. 'cause I think, from what I've heard, everyone who walks through that door definitely has a massive impact on their life. So you gotta look at it from the other point of view too, right?\n\nYou two gentlemen, you get to 67 and a [00:36:00] half and you retire. And a curtain comes down and your life stops. I found that out. Yeah. Everything. Your mate's gone. Your work's gone. You've got no reason to get outta bed in the morning. And that's difficult. In my case, I was told I was dying as well, so they gave me less than four years to live.\n\nAnd it really come down hard. Nobody wanted to talk to me. And so there's gonna be a stage where you bloke are looking at mnet and things like that as well. So it's not just us we're talking about. People coming through because that's when you need help. Yeah. When did you wish you knew about Toad? Oh, I had to retire at 67, sorry, 57 years old and I wish I knew it at 57 'cause I couldn't even, I couldn't get outta bed for six months.\n\nI used to sell cash s and point of sale. I was a diesel mechanic for seven years, but I had a major accident in a paddock while I was by myself. And I had to drag myself virtually from here, right down to the road to [00:37:00] crawl to get somebody to pull me out. So I come up. So I joined with my dad and he used to do cash registers and we were lucky.\n\nWe landed the lotto machines, which put us as a thing because every time we sold a lotto machine, we used to get a cash register and that's how we built my business. And I do Plain Lands Hotel. I do everybody and I still go and see my customers. A lot of them are dropped off the. Wheel or whatever you want to call it and that sort of stuff.\n\nSo yeah. And a lot of people that come see, they ring me up and seeing how I'm going and all that sort of stuff. And that's people. And I've done all the way up from Burketown all the way down into New South Wales. I used to replace my vehicle every year 'cause I do over 150,000 kilometers 'cause I would go and see 'em and I used to go and see everybody and that's how my business grew.\n\nOkay. So if we can do that and have, work with that. I'm not trying to tell you I was topnotch or whatever, but that's how I worked them [00:38:00] in, sometimes it took me years. Yeah. And that, but yeah. Yeah. I was general manager of the Ford dealership. So I took Ford and Caboolture I ran that I worked for Zaps as well for a while too.\n\nBut yeah, I got sick. I thought I had pneumonia. Yeah. And I still got outta bed on the Saturday morning. Went to work. Yeah. And I did 10 hour days. Yeah. And I pushed my team as hard as I could push 'em all day long. Oh yeah. And that night I went to bed and I woke up and I couldn't breathe. Yeah. So off to the doctors in the morning and off to hospital and yeah.\n\nBut I couldn't stop. I carried on working for five years after that. I've only been retired about a month. I had to doctor, hold me straight, he said to me. You had a 25% chance of dying. And I said, what's that mean? Five, four years? And he goes, no. 25% chance of not getting to your car. He was trying to scare me.\n\nOf course. And it worked. So I retired and I got better. That's the sick part about I got the stress went. Yeah. Because you were [00:39:00] stressed. Yeah. Didn't think I was, we haven't always met here either. Did exist in other places in town, didn't we before? I already got this primary system. It goes back a few years.\n\nJust tell a quick little story. Nev used to be the doorman. I say that not disrespectful, but he, we had a, we used to meet at Gold Park. That's where I first joined one place. Yeah. And and never have a, had a box about AB with all their name badges. And as we come through the door, never give you your name badge and tick your name off the list.\n\nAnd then at the end of that. Day we'd say, oh, there's been 34 or 44 or something here today. Did that for years. Didn't know. Or you did? I don't remember how long a guard it was, but a long time. I, anyway, peers every once lost their name badge. A few things went missing up there in including our music [00:40:00] machine.\n\nOkay. Thanks for letting us hang out. Thanks for not kicking us out. You can definitely let the team know if we're never, ever welcome back again. But yeah, as a I say it with on behalf of Ben as well. Something that is super important to me in my life is my elders.\n\nAnd in particular learning, learning from people. Definitely. Feel incredibly thankful to hear what you shared and the bravery and courage. But also I think the story you shared about how much our families mean to us, but also the challenges with aging.\n\nBut I think your story has impacted me incredibly today and I think if we can continue to amplify that across different mediums, special tonic magic will, will keep on happening. We'll stop talking. If you are comfort in having a bit of a portrait taken through the door we'll just, Ben's pretty good at creating that.\n\nNick just sits me up here too to create a photo that's incredibly difficult to take a photo of. I'm, yeah I'm super [00:41:00] pumped to be able to try it out. But one, one thing I was just singing as well was I was just waiting for those Nick and I get to spend a bit of time with some young people that get into trouble a lot.\n\nAnd yeah, I just feel grateful that maybe there's an opportunity where young people that are struggling are able to connect with people like yourselves who do have time, patience, and openness to that stuff. Just wanted to call that out as a. Opportunity, I think. And I know that you already do a lot of that stuff with young people and there's something extremely profound around having young people that are struggling with connection.\n\nFind some elders who are willing to give them time. So super pumped. But yeah, we'll try some pickies. There we go. And then we're doing interview two, but thanks, you okay.\n\nCool. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much. Nick, do you wanna help facilitate or Yeah. Thank you. I [00:42:00] do this Bernie, while he is there. What you think? What are you thinking, Ben? I think that the gnarliest opportunity is for people to stand here. Yeah. 'cause I think there's a bunch of reflection on there. You can't see it.\n\nBoth people are here and almost guys, while you're still talking, you still got time. We do have to get you to sign a consent form. Yeah, we can, for the guys to be able to use your info or your photos and then almost turn your voice, do need to fill those out if you don't want to agree, you don't have to.\n\nNice. Good. Having a chat. We also have the raffles. Oh, very important. So to fill this in here, it's a bit weird you because.\n\nMy on as you'll have table to fill the, for me, just put your name, maybe close that door, Nick. Yeah. Where it says name [00:43:00] about a third of the way down. And then actually that looks good. We level.\n\nWhat's what? What are none. Cut. Awesome.\n\nCan I get as our.\n\n",

Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: you're the one videoing.\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 7: Good. How\n\nSpeaker 5: are you? How am I Dar?\n\nSpeaker 6: You wanna come and have a yarn? Why not? Yeah. Want\n\nSpeaker 5: to? Yeah. Have a yaba.\n\nSpeaker 7: Why not? You wanna hear my story? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 5: we'll do. We'll do. I'm having a go next. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: I thought you were finish. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: I know darling.\n\nI know. We're just familiarizing ourselves. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: okay. We're ready to go. Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: I won't be more than two hours. I'll be right.\n\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So on on the camera, we just need your full name and to spell it so that we make sure we know the name right.\n\nSpeaker 5: Hello, my name is Shana Wentworth. S-H-A-R-N-N-A-W-E-N-T-W-O-R-T-H.\n\nSpeaker 6: Amazing. Tell us a little bit about yourself. In your story?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I came down here today, uh, Ry Gully. Um, it's, it's not so [00:01:00] much that I'm starving hungry, but, um, it's nice to get out and have a good clean cunt meal. Most of these persons I've known for a long time, and, uh, Steve, who runs the establishment, I've known him for.\n\nOh, 25 plus years and I appreciate that they've got some fruit and veggies to take home. 'cause everything helps. And over the years I've spoken to people and we've laughed, we've cried. We are giggled, we are screamed, we've yelled, we're everything. And it's just nice to come out and meet people. Um. Some of them are around my age, some are younger and that, but not everyone's fortunate to be able to drive down.\n\nSome of them are homeless, but I've never seen any major problems [00:02:00] down here. And if there is, it would be NI in the bud. Very quick. There's no alcohol and there's no smoking on the premises. And people, well, they just respect. And they're just grateful and we just, you know, laugh and just talk about things and it's great and there's always plenty to go around.\n\nSpeaker 6: Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky and what, what sort of you, what do you feel about their presence here? Or what, what do you think about Orange Sky?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I feel safe and, uh, there is a police station close by, but. Uh, to my knowledge, they've never had to come. Uh, it's very handy for people that don't live in the immediate area because the train is within walking distance.\n\nI believe there are buses that come into the area to help people, and I think it's just [00:03:00] nice.\n\nSpeaker 6: And what do you think about Orange Guy?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service?\n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly. I'm not very good on names, but you know, I just say, hi, darl, how you going?\n\nHi sweetie. Or, or whatever. And sometimes people give you a kiss and a hug. Sometimes people are upset and they need to talk to someone. I'm not saying I understand everything or that I can help everyone, but it's nice to just have a little talk. Mm mm And, and [00:04:00] some people, not for me to say, they come down and you can tell they've had the same t-shirt on for a month.\n\nMm. Not my business. Mm. There was a service that where you could actually have a shower here, lot like, um. I think there was two or three showers, a caravan type thing, and I thought that was lovely. And whilst you're having a shower, oh, free soap and towel, bit of the old shampoo. Mm. Then you could, um, you know, if you were really desperate, someone finds you clean clothing, believe me.\n\nMm. It's very kind. And then whilst your clothing and yourself are being freshened up, you can go and have a lovely meal.\n\nSpeaker 6: Why do you think these types of, um, meals and services are important in the community?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, as I said, there's people that, [00:05:00] um, they just, well, not everyone, but you see them sitting on the streets so lonely and so depressed, and nobody will talk to them because as I said, the same t-shirt for a month.\n\nAnd you don't know their situation. Not everyone is drugs and alcohol. Mm-hmm. Bear in mind, a few may have a mental health, which is made worse by being on the street. Mm-hmm. Because there's, there's not really anyone around to help. I've seen it in the city. They've just walked past and what's a couple of dollars?\n\nThey could get some cool water. A nice sandwich. Mm.\n\nSpeaker 6: And how would you describe your own sort of experience over the last little while? Like, is that, like, how would you explain to people your own situation, scenario, and story?\n\nSpeaker 5: My living [00:06:00] situation? Mm, yes. Um, I'm now divorced. Um, I am, I'm in a ministry of Housing house, home house.\n\nUm, I've been there for 26 years. Um, I'm a mother of five. They've all left home of course, and um, unfortunately they've got themselves because I pushed very hard for education and they've got themselves some very good jobs and they forget that they've come from me and mild background. Mm. And the money that they receive each week has gone to their heads and they see me as just a thing.\n\nMm. I find it, sorry, I find it very hard. Um, I see it as borderline, um, a abuse. Mm. And [00:07:00] I have my youngest son I have not seen for three and a half years. Um, he. He's on alcohol. He was living with me after his divorce and alcohol causes temper. I believe I'm allowed to say to him, behave yourself, and if you don't, you're out the door.\n\nIt escalated. The rest is private. It was a police matter.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm-hmm. What's the, um, what's the opportunity to. I suppose, yeah. You've been talking about this place and what's the opportunity to create new community and new people here? Do you know what I mean? Like is that something that you are working to do and is this something that's helpful for you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do think? Well, look over the years I, I've been coming here, as I said, several years over, over the years I've noticed, and as recently as 18 months [00:08:00] ago, a lot of. Uh, places similar to this that were offering meals. Mm. They've just run out of funding and they've closed down, et cetera. Right. And as a result,\n\nSpeaker 6: sorry, there's a nice photo.\n\nSpeaker 5: And as a result, a lot of them, uh, have heard about this place through word of mouth and they've just drifted across here and it's nothing as Steve is extremely generous. And it's nothing for a hundred plus people to turn up at two separate settings on Christmas for a meal and a little bit of happiness, laughter, a generous with the present and a nice box of food to help you through the Christmas break.\n\nAnd for miles around, this is the only place where you can get a good quality meal. And they, [00:09:00] they have soup in the wintertime as well as the meal. Mm-hmm. And you can take food away and people are grateful for that. And it's good food that you can eat. Um, a lot of people don't have cooking devices because they're, uh, maybe sleeping in the car or something like that.\n\nThey can come here, get a nice full belly, and they'll sleep well that night.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. So amazing. What, what do you think, what do you think the general community could learn from these types of communities and people helping each other? Like, do you think that this is something that is unique and like, how do, how do people, you said it before, like, I think money gets to people's heads sometimes and they forget how to help people.\n\nYes, it's true. It's true. How do we, how do we talk about these places that other people sort of, these\n\nSpeaker 5: people are on the same level as me? Just be grateful. Today, [00:10:00] there was very little on the takeaway table, as in fruit and veggies. I was offered more and I looked around, there was people behind me and I said, look, I'm taking what I can fit in my fridge and what I can eat.\n\nMm, okay. I will make way. It's the way it is. And the people in there, they're not greedy. And if they appear greedy, it's just, they've come from different backgrounds. Some of them have been in jail.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you don't talk, you just eat your meal and you guard your meal. Mm. Because that's the, the situation that they may have come from.\n\nMm. So you, you, you, you don't judge them how they eat or what they put in their pocket because no one's going to say, put it back. No one.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm. Alright. I could talk all day, but I think we need to like find some other [00:11:00] people. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm just grateful and there are occasions when Steve gets in a hairdresser free.\n\nAnd he also gets in a masseur free and people love it. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yes. Yes. And it's so good. All right, I'm gonna take a photo. Okay. Okay. Get my good side. I'll, I'll take, I'll take that mic off first.\n\nSpeaker 6: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: just in the shot.\n\nSpeaker 6: Did\n\nSpeaker 5: I say too much?\n\nSpeaker 6: You said an amazing amount. It's true. Yes.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh, I'm way too bright. One sec. It's, this is my fault. Okay.\n\nHow about one you sit up a little bit more and Oh, that's, oh, that's awesome. Okay, great. Amazing. Thank you so much. [00:12:00] Um.\n",

      "Transcript": "So how's that sound Ben? Is that working? Yeah man, that's wicked. Make sure you're focused here. Cool. And I think... Oh, that's not... Can you spin your chair so it's this way now? How's that sound? Awesome. The one thing that's important when you're doing this stuff is like, if you talk with one person from a particular place, you want to have them on the other side. Yeah. I think I took this way, that way. I see what you mean, yep. Alright, let's rock this. Okay, point them there. Alright brother, we are rolling. Okay. Just say your name and spell it, it'd be awesome. Okay, so it's Brendan Gunning. B-R-E-N-D-A-N G-U-N-N-I-N-G. Cool. You can just speak to me, I'm sorry. Tell us a little bit about the school and your role at the school. Okay, so we're a Catholic secondary college in Mackay. Have enrolment of about 1500 students, year 7 to 12. And have been around the world for about a year now. And been around the Mackay district now for many years. Cool. What's the, why do you think that the school wants to engage with things like this in Mackay? Like what's the vision of the school, I guess? Or the values of the school that means that you end up coming to the school? Well I guess our four values at St Patrick's College are compassion, hope, justice and respect. And we have a real strong focus on service in the community. So to partnership up with Orange Sky and run the Brekkie van is a great opportunity for our students to practice those values in the community. That's awesome. What do you think Orange Sky is, I guess, like Orange Sky's conversations, Washington's connection to you and the school? What does Orange Sky mean? Well number one, certainly filling a need in our community. But it's really, like I mentioned before, it's really a service to our community. It's really a service to our friends in the community that are less fortunate than ourselves. Opportunity for conversation is our big thing. But yeah, and being able to partnership up with you guys is a real plus for us. That's awesome. What do you think the students get out of it? Well it's interesting because we never have any problems filling shifts. It's almost like the students are jumping over each other to get down here in the morning. And often one of the problems we have is more students than we have students. And we actually need, but that's a great problem to have. But our students really like doing stuff. And to come down here and either cook a barbecue, have conversations with the friends down here, they get a real lot out of doing stuff for the community. That's cool. What are the types of things you think the kids will get out of, like in terms of learning and coming? And I guess, what's his young fellow's name again? Will. Will was saying, I guess, like he understands the opportunities. Yeah. He understands the opportunities to do things outside of traditional education and engage in the community. What do you think that the kids actually leave school with and they wouldn't have if they didn't come here? I think we've all got our perceptions, Ben. But I think actually coming down here and doing shifts, some of our students have been eight, nine times. And I think it really gives them a better understanding about, you know, a wide range of people in our community that they may not have already had. And yeah, I think sometimes their perceptions are a little bit different to reality to what they actually are. So by coming down and spending time on the brekkie van, working with Orange Sky, I think it just really opens their eyes and maybe clarifies a little bit to the, you know, to the real story that's happening in our community. And I guess for you being principal here, principal? Assistant principal, yeah. Assistant principal. I guess you being a leader at the school, what do you get out of yourself in terms of coming and what does the school get out of it as well? Yeah. Definitely. Look, I, almost from a selfish point of view, I come down here every time the kids are down here, twice a week. I always sort of joke this is the highlight of my day. It's downhill after I leave the brekkie van. But I like to model the expectations. And if the kids see us down here rather than just asking them to come down, I think that's important. But I love the conversation with the friends and even with the Orange Sky staff, you know, just over there talking to Andrew Gibbs. Yeah, I just think it's a real connection. Yeah. I just think it's a real connection to the community. And I think that's what the school's all about as well. That's cool. Was there anything that you wanted to say that, like, reflected stuff that you wanted to show the school? Like, was there any, like, an open question, I guess, anything you'd like to say? You're right, Troy, come through. We'll get a seat. You're right, Troy. He's paused it. I don't borrow me. You want to, I'll put a seat here for you if you like. Is it on TV? No, no, you just make a little bit of a... Does it fit under your belt? Yeah. Yeah. Good. No. Will you do this sort of stuff? I'll just hang around and Nick and Lucas, the co-founders, ask me to travel around and tell stories. We've got Orange Sky here. Oh, really? Yeah. Good to meet you, man. We'll have a yarn soon. Yeah. Oh, no. No, they're being good people, Orange Sky. Thanks, man. Yeah, look, I'll just say, Ben, that sometimes we're a bit limited with opportunities for our students to, you know, provide service. And to get out into the community. And this has been a real win-win. You know, win-win for the, like I said, the guests that, the friends that come along in the morning. And a win-win for the students and for the school. Yeah, it's a real plus. And it seems to be going from strength to strength. And not only the students too, I think our staff benefit a lot from it as well. They're down here and modelling the expectations. But also, you know, they're giving service and giving back to the community as well. So, yeah, it's a great partnership that we've got with Orange Sky. Yeah. And hopefully it'll continue, yeah. Amazing. I think that's it. That's it? Okay. I'll take a quick peeky. Okay. What I'll do, I'm just going to do it here because we've got some challenging sunlight today. Looks okay. But I'm always up for a challenge. Here's what we can do. I'll just pop that there, right? Yeah. Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, come and drive with me. Mate, I always like that. If you're standing there, actually, I think it's okay. Let's see how we go. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. MVD Okay. Yeah. We've got a young lady who's scared of me. Crank. Crank. That's just a throw-over for you, I guess. So we'll send her over. Thanks again, mate. All the best. Thanks, mate. Thanks. Thanks, mate. Thanks, mate. Oh, really? Is this your main sort of vibe? Is it mining or is it like transport? I don't really know. Railways. Railways. I should have known that. Do you see the train? Peggy, you do see it? Yeah, right. Where are you from, man? Brisbane. Brisbane. Do you go to Mount Isa? We do, yeah. I was out there for many years. I've now got a bit of stuff happening there, which is cool. And what's your role there?\n",

      "Transcript": "All right. All right, brother. Wicked. Just tell me your name and... Your full name and spell it would be great. It's Colin Banks. C-O-L-I-N-B-A-N-K-S. Okay. What's the Colin Banks story? Tell us a bit about you first. Well, I originally came from Sydney, relocated to Harvey Bay, then came back, and came back... Then I've been homeless for the last... since Christmas. Staying at a... different car parks, and found out about this, and came here to do me washing. I've been doing it by hand. It's a bit hard when you've got nowhere really to do it. What was the... Was there a particular reason or journey to being homeless? Oh, yeah, family. Oh, you guys. Yeah, right. And then... And then... What's... For people that don't know what your experience is like, do you want to share a little bit about what you get up to? Really? Right. Well, really... It's hard off. I lost my pension when I moved out of home. So I had no income. So I had to stay in car parks. But I had a caravan. So I was pretty right there. And... I just couldn't afford to stay in, you know, caravan parks and that. So I just stayed around local, trying to work things out. How did you sort of stumble across Orange Sky Island? I was... I don't know what you meant to say, but you didn't know what you were talking about. You didn't know what you were talking about. I don't know if you were talking about the caravan. I think I was told about it. I'm not sure now because it's been coming for a while. And I'm told about the help with the church here, the community centre, and the wash machine. Oh, very hard. You only can do a few things at a time. It's a different feeling to be doing that. But I think I was told about it. And I was really, really, really, really worried that I wasn't going to be able to get out of it. And I told them that I was going to have to pay. And I thought, well, it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be easy. church here, the community centre and the wash machine. What's washing by hand? Very hard. You only can do a few things at a time and then you find some way to put them up to dry. Coffee or tea? Two sugar. Coffee. Thanks. No, thank you. Tell us about where you're staying now and what that's like. I'm staying in... ...a friend's front yard with a caravan. Thank you for that. What's it like living in a caravan? Oh, I don't mind it. Less of a clean. I've got everything in it, fridge and water, shower. So I'm pretty right there. Independent. Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky. What do you feel about the service? I like it. It's very good. The staff are very friendly. They're very lovable, cute. Do you want a cheese-tasted sandwich as well? Yes, please. Do you want one? No. OK. They come down and do our washing and you meet other people here and talk to them. What's the community like, I guess? Is there a community of people experiencing homelessness? There is a big community of it around. I was staying at Lakes Beach down here. There's quite a few there. There's another one at the entrance. There's quite a few staying there. But the only thing is... ...councillors sometimes come and make you move. You know, there should be a more permanent spot where the homeless are controlled. What's that like, I guess, with the relationship? Like the council and being moved on? How does that feel? Well, actually, down here it's pretty good because there is a... ...how can I put it? A place where, if you look on the internet, it's coming up with New South Wales Government, that if you're homeless you can stay in public areas and the council is supposed to help you find some... ...and community senators to help. What would you say is like one of the more... ...some of the more important things about Orange Sky? Like why is it good and what do you get out of it? It is good. You do meet people through Orange Sky. You get to meet people. You can do a bit of your washing and that. You're staying clean and tidy. You're not walking around like a grub. And what's it like, I guess, just being here and talking? Is that good as well? Like why is it good? Yeah, it's good because you're doing something, you know, and you're relating to other people. Do you have like a normal day? Like what do you do on a normal day, I guess? Just sit around, read books, probably go for walks, depending on the weather and where I am. Is there a sort of thing that you're trying to do at the moment to change your conditions? Or are you okay in the caravan? I'm okay in the caravan. I don't mind it. As I said, it's handy. It's not a small one. So I've got plenty of room and that in it. I've got a shower, toilet, so... What do you think the general perception is of... ...some of the things that you're doing? Someone in your situation, I guess, from an Australian perspective, do you think people have a good understanding about your situation? The homeless and all that? No. What do you think? I think a lot of people don't want to recognise it. It's interesting like... They know it's there, but they don't want to be involved or recognise what's going on. I have met people that say we shouldn't be... ...staying in places where we've got to stay. You know, it's Australia-wide and... It's a big thing. Different circumstances have put people in different positions. Are there people you think are really disconnected to a homeless? And like... Are there things that we could do better in terms of providing spaces... ...for people to be hanging out together? Yes. Yeah. A bit more. Can I have one of your walls? Thank you. Very full of love. You got it? It's hot. Yeah, just for you. I'll put it down. Sure. Yeah. I think there should be more involvement, you know... ...in things that are happening. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I just got kind of like a... It's not just like a washing laundry place. It's kind of like a... Meeting place. Yeah. Well, how do you feel about that idea about having a place that you can just yarn and have a catch up and stuff? Yeah. It feels good to have someone come down. I come down on a Friday morning and we sit around and talk and that. That's cool. And how do you feel about that? Yeah. That's cool. And how do you find the volunteers? Good. Very friendly, nice, helpful. It's interesting too, like, because they... Do you think it's better that they are volunteers because you know that they're doing it... Yeah. ...for their own reasons? You know they're helpful and that because they're volunteers. They've got their heart in the job. That's cool. Cool. Is there anything else you wanted to say or...? No. I can't think of anything. Can you? No. It's awesome. What I'm going to do is take a photo though. Okay? So... Yeah.\n",

Yep. Just your name and spell it for me first. My name is Aaron. Spell A-A-R-O-N. Sure. Last name. Stapleton. 42 years old. Been staying here at Vinny's for the last four weeks or so now. Yeah, been using yeah, laundry service, which is bloody awesome. It's great. They do an excellent job.<�/p> <�p>Big help, especially when we're in a position like we are. And just little things like washing and stuff like that, it is hard to, hard to find a place to do it and stuff like that. So the convenience is awesome. Okay. Any questions or anything like that? And what about, a bit about yourself though?<�/p> <�p>That's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.<�/p> <�p>And just getting back on my feet now, mate. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?<�/p> <�p>I guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>But when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.<�/p> <�p>Drinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.<�/p> <�p>Like I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.<�/p> <�p>Yeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.<�/p> <�p>That's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.<�/p> <�p>And what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.<�/p> <�p>But she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>And that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.<�/p> <�p>They've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?<�/p> <�p>I don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not. Literally probably 25 years jail and now serving a couple of bad sentences\n",

      "Transcript": "Olga\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSpeaker View &amp; Screen Share: In, in relation to, this interest, I suppose justice and justice reform. That's probably been high priority for me over my working life anyway, just because of the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people here in the territory and some of the legislation that's been passed.\n\nIt's just been absolutely draconian and targeted, inherently racist. So yeah, while I've never worked actively in that justice system directly, apart from my time at Dun la Dilberg, getting primary healthcare into the youth detention center. So that's really been the sort of journey.\n\nAnd tell us a little bit how you first came across David and Diagram, or, and what did that feel like, that initial engagement and understanding of what that is? We were at Dan La Doba. We were doing sort of major submissions to the Royal Commission into Youth Detention and child Protection. And as part of that work, I had a bunch of interns doing some research about trying to identify best practice, internationally.\n\nAs a consequence of that work, [00:01:00] David was also giving evidence. Unfortunately, again, he had to, could do it by video link. I think if he'd come here in person it would've really made a big impact. But anyway, so it was really through that process that I came across Diagram and the thing that struck me was, the stats that he provided.\n\nFor example, about recidivism rates being less than 20% after three years, I don't think there's anything anywhere else in the world that matches that or comes near to it. Even the Missouri model, which is developed by a guy called Vincent Aldi, and that's been held as a success in the us. I'm not sure that they've been able to successfully replicate that model elsewhere in the United States.\n\nAnd so for me it was a bit of a challenge about okay, how come David and Diagram have been able to replicate their program and their activities, across Spain, which again is. Enormously diverse, culturally linguistically climatically from top to bottom. So having been to Spain and went to [00:02:00] visit, one of their programs there it was really that thing of seeing it for myself because I just really couldn't wrap my head around how a genuine therapeutic model that was non coercive and non-punitive could actually work in practice.\n\nWhen you see the way in which the juvenile justice systems operate here in Australia, it's incredibly harsh. It's a punitive approach. It takes no account of the development of young people, and particularly kids who come from, impoverished or disadvantaged backgrounds. So we've got a long way to go on Australia, I think, to really try to successfully replicate or implement a diagram program here.\n\nOne thing that struck me when I was there was a consistency of care, but also consistency of the connections that they get across. Whether it's a systems based thing or whether it's like a support base or connect reconnection with family, is that something you think is replicatable in Australia and or are [00:03:00] there elements of that we can support do better?\n\nNo, I think it's definitely a model that could be adapted and adopted here in Australia and be done quite successfully. I think the other thing for me is that, there's this very strong recognition that you can't just work with the child on their own in isolation from their family or the environment in which they're So going to go back to, sorry.\n\nYeah. All.\n\nSo having, the primary carers and family involved right from day one, I think is incredibly important. One, because I think it gives that young person a sense of. Safety and security, that they're not there on their own. And that, that it's a sort of a combined joint effort, with all of the best possible professionals that you can have.\n\nAnd the fact that support is ongoing post-release, I think is really important. The model also about their sort of step down from being very structured, highly supervised program in the [00:04:00] early part of your time with diagram through to a more and independent living where you are taking responsibility for your day to day needs.\n\nGetting yourself to and from school or to work or wherever you're going. That sense of trust, signing in, signing out as these young people come back into the center at the end of each day. So I think there's lots of aspects of the diagram model, which just simply have never been done in Australia.\n\nOne sec. Gotta pause this one sec.\n\nGimme one sec. I'll You [00:05:00] are.\n\nOne thing I've been thinking about, I think you talked, you've brought this up with me, is the, there's this fear-based narrative that happens in Australia and especially like this recidivism stats and media spin and things, but how do we create almost like a positive message of opportunities in Australia?\n\nEspecially with Diagram coming, how can we do that in a way that's almost connecting the community with understanding if we provide the support to [00:06:00] young people, then the whole community is supported. Not just it's not just helping naughty kids. It's like supporting the whole community to feel more connected and better.\n\nI think that's right. Part of it is the ability to tell that story and I can't remember which. Center I visited in Spain, but it was located in like a light industrial area. And it was a very old building, old detention facility. It looked pretty hideous from the outside, with big high walls, et cetera.\n\nAnd I asked David about, what do your, fellow neighbors think about having this huge detention center smack bang in the middle of their business area? And he said, oh, in the beginning people were a bit concerned. By and large, these kids now actually gain employment and trade skills by being able to go out there and go to work with people in those businesses.\n\nSo there's a very strong close relationship there. And I think in Spain there's also a very deep sense of community and community responsibility. It's not as nuclear family focused as we tend to be here in Australia. [00:07:00] So the sense of community being involved in, improved outcomes for young people is something that.\n\nPeople are committed to, and I think we can build that sense of community here in Australia because if you listen to the comments, particularly from people who've been victims of crime, it's one of the things that they say, our neighborhood is not like it used to be. So if you can rebuild that sense of community and trust and giving kids a second chance or sometimes a third chance kids aren't born inherently evil or bad.\n\nSo you need to understand where they've come from and what led them to get to where they are, but also having that very strong commitment to believing that people can change. And some good examples of that. I think where you see young people succeed and thrive and, contribute to society is what I think gives us that sense of spirit and hope.\n\nI'm really conscious too, Ben, of, the role that the police and the media play in this sort of. Very old, tired narrative about we've gotta be tough on crime, this is no good. Locking them [00:08:00] up, kids getting off, scot-free, et cetera. All of this same old sort of trite comments that you get.\n\nI think, sorry, if people really know and understand the program and how it works, what the expectations are, my sense is I think there will be a lot of support for it. People want to see something new and something different. And I think Australians, have this attitude of we don't have to prove everything before you start, get out there and give it a go.\n\nThat's something I think we need to build on. Yeah, totally. I'm very much of the spirit of giving us a go and like understanding how we do that in a way where you can test and learn and understand. The other thing I've been interested really thinking about is it just.[00:09:00] \n\nSorry, my my internet died. Something froze there, didn't it? [00:10:00] I think I think I forgot to add another night at my hotel and they disconnected my wifi because I forgot to God, they're efficient. Too efficient. Yeah. Too efficient. I think, I don't know how far I got with my question, but I was, I've been thinking a lot about why the states support youth justice and how there's a thousand young people in detention.\n\nEvery night across Australia. But and we spend millions of dollars on that and how, why there isn't a national sort of practice and best practice and how come we can't get some more sort of Australia wide knowledge and intelligence to, to run the system. Do you think Diagram could support some more?\n\nLike training opportunities and building more of that best practice model across Australia rather than doing this state by state bitsy approach that we have. I think that's gonna be a bit of a challenge because as the jurisdictions hang on to whatever power [00:11:00] they've got, fairly tightly, and the ability to do something of, national minimum standards.\n\nI think is going to be a challenge, but I also believe that it's potentially doable if you work through, because every state has a children's commissioner. Yeah. So working with them, but I think it's also widening the net in terms of who are the key stakeholders. And I think for example, groups like you probably think I'm insane here, but Neighborhood Watch.\n\nYeah. Yeah. They're a really vocal, powerful group as a lobby group. And I think getting some of those groups, to be part of the champions and advocates. So it's those groups who, or even victims of crime, those other groups who quite often feel like they don't get heard. And I think we need to build those relationships and to get them to come on this journey with us.\n\nBroadening our thinking about, who our key stakeholders are. Needs to be done in a way that's a little bit wider than what we've traditionally done. And I think that together [00:12:00] with, people who are child health experts, people with expertise in children's development and education, so that when you are working to have these national standards or minimum standards and guidelines, there are some really good ones for example, that come out of Europe.\n\nThe Council of Europe, for example has published, lots of material on these sorts of things. So Australia lags a long way behind. I worry that we're increasingly moving away from international standards and norms, and we really need to go back to those. I think taking very much that sort of child development approach too, where you've got health people forensic psychologists and the like, who can also be part of this network.\n\nYeah it's a really good way to put it is that network and like I think there is that opportunity for it not to be like another group that is a bunch of forums where people come together and just talk, I think is a really good opportunity to do something where I. [00:13:00] It's like activating the practice-based stuff.\n\nIt's like coming together to learn how to work with people better. It's like a bunch of different indigenous groups from all over Australia coming together and sharing that, what they're doing in their community that's working. And yeah, hopefully we can create something where. We don't have that four year cycle of hunger and thirst for the community where it's a shifting sort of priorities and we can create something where there's some like systematic stuff.\n\nAnd yeah. I'm I've got, I think been too, sharing what's been happening in the international space. So for example, in Scotland, with legislative change and reform of their juvenile justice system, they've significantly reduced the number of kids that are now in detention. I think it's down into the hundreds.\n\nBut I was reading something interesting just last week about Texas where you know, it's been notorious for its rates of incarceration and imprisonment, and in fact, now they're moving to empty jails. I think they've closed six prisons across Texas. Who [00:14:00] would've ever believed it? Maybe they've emptied them for all the bloody illegal immigrants coming across the border.\n\nWho knows? But, there are some really good examples of where other countries have made significant inroads into how they've reformed their justice systems, and in fact, created greater safety for communities rather than raising, this prospect of greater risk and harm. So it takes a bit of courage, I think, to to get people to that point where they can embrace this sort of change.\n\nBut until you can share those stories with them. They really don't have the confidence to say come on, let's do it. It's a ridiculous waste of money. That's the other thing, I describe any money that gets spent in the justice system almost as negative expenditure. You are never gonna get a positive return on that investment ever.\n\nIt's something I've been thinking about a lot. And you at the moment, like the messaging that's being driven in the state of Queensland is that. There needs to be like more, just [00:15:00] more happen. And I think that what happens is. You get more people that are in positions of management and strategy and like government and there's all these researchers and things.\n\nAnd I think what's happening is there's a lot of development of there's a lot of opportunities for people to get paid, a lot of money to do some thinking and, but there's not a lot of actual on the ground things that are happening in the community. And I think when you're there needs to be a matching of all of this fear and emotion with what's like the practical steps that are happening. And yeah, I, it always astounds me that okay. I think Youth Justice has doubled their government funding for this year. I think it went from 300 to 600 million or something for the administrative function, and I see.\n\nI would hope that there would be an opportunity in the future if you can share some best practice that they start to spread that sort of money through more of the proactive health and as you're saying, those other groups that are possibly doing some great community work. But not [00:16:00] classified as Youth justice, but like connecting these young people to positive opportunities and yeah, even just creating more things in community where young people can do, like I think there's, people always talk about like digital things and giving people information, but.\n\nI think there needs to be a bit of a discussion around that. Events and physical spaces and yeah, improving things for, to, for kids to do rather than be on their phones and on the computer. I think that's right. In fact, there was some really interesting research that was done by God the hell was his name.\n\nHe published a report called Dropping Off the Edge. There it was through Jesuit social services or something. I can't remember now. Anyway, but it was really interesting when he analyzed, for example, where in even poor suburbs where there was basic sporting infrastructure, a basketball court, football field, et cetera, where those facilities actually existed, you have lower rates of youth offending compared to suburbs where none of that [00:17:00] infrastructure existed.\n\nSo that tells you something straight away, if you don't provide services and activities for young people, then you're almost encouraging them to go and find their own opportunities for entertainment or thrill seeking or whatever it is that they're up to, cool. Last little question is what's, what do you think gets diagram here?\n\nWhat's the tipping point for us, do you think? In terms of like actually starting something? I think probably, David's board having the confidence that, this is a long way from Europe. Yeah. And to want to come to Australia, they've really gotta be confident about the ability to one, get established here and two, to start to get some traction.\n\nSo perhaps, it's been this constant train of people from Australia that we've been sending over there to go visit, di Graham to meet with David and the team. I think people realize, on their board that, we're serious about trying to get them here. So I think once we can get diagram established and incorporated, excuse me, [00:18:00] and to have somebody from Diagram, be based permanently here in Australia yeah.\n\nThen we can really start to make some inroads, I think. I mentioned to you previously too, I don't think we've gotta be trying to launch straight into the juvenile detention space, but maybe positioning diagram as an alternative to detention. So with genuine court ordered therapeutic orders which would include, things like attending school or education of some sort, all of the sort of health and developmental supports that a young person might need.\n\nAnd that the courts should then be able to monitor that to get regular progress reports and updates. It would probably require young people to per, perhaps spend a minimum of 12 months in a program because from the experience in Spain has been that, you've gotta get the dose if you want to get the right result and the right outcome.\n\nWe've gotta be prepared to do that. A lot of people, I suspect. Particularly, human rights lawyers and [00:19:00] advocates will be very apprehensive about long orders, such as 12 month orders. But, I'll be better off to do a 12 month order. Have one young person do that program once completed over that 12 month period and never come back into the justice system again.\n\nOr do you wanna see people continuously cycling in and out of the system and quite often, committing worse offenses as they go and transitioning. From a youth detention facility into the adult prisons. I think human rights lawyers have to get their heads around it. This is not detention, it's actually about a developmental environment and it's about working with kids and their families.\n\nAwesome. I'm gonna, I'm gonna hit stop on this.\n\n",

I used to work at the, at Walls End Centrelink. Prior to that I was a manager of an army disposal store. But I was at Centrelink for about two years. I took a redundancy and prior to that I was about eight, six to seven years at Commonwealth Service. So you're a full time job? Yeah, I'm a full time job. I'm a full time job. Cool. What's, what's your current like living situation now? What are you, what are you doing? I live in a one bedroom unit just around behind this community centre here and I haven't got a washing machine because I can't fit one in. It's limited, it's very limited for space. But it's better than living on the street. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just, yeah, a little bit of a little bit of a stretch. You know, so it's good that way. Yeah. Tell us about how you first found out about Ironsky. Well the lady that lived above me, she was some, won some award and she told me about this and I didn't know about it and I came round here because I was paying the lady next door five bucks every week to wash. But I, that was it, just washing. It wasn't put, drying. This is great. This is great because it washes. And this is it. and they drive for you which is fantastic yeah and it's easy for me to get around here too yeah that's cool and what's the like how does it feel to be able to come and have people to talk with and engage oh it's really good yeah they're really great people that work for you yeah unbelievable yeah what's a normal shift feel and look like like what do you do during the shift what's a normal shift like what do you do during a normal shift what do you what do you get up to like what happens well when this is here you may know just sit down and generally talk and just wait for wait for the washing to be done yeah nothing else no i can't run around the block anymore like i used to when you're 82 years old you're limited in what you can do you know what's it like to having volunteers here that listen to you and talk to you and stuff oh they're great they're great great people fantastic what do you talk about what do you get up to oh just what they do and what like we got one one bloke greg is most amazing man i've ever known in my life at 61 year old yeah the things he's doing i just just can't he's just unbelievable he's so fit he's unbelievable greg unbelievable and they're so the ladies are so nice and friendly and they're really great yeah that's cool what's um and you've got other people here that you talk with other people that aren't volunteers which what's that mate do you have other people that aren't volunteers that you talk with here that oh yeah well sometimes some people come by and they have a bit of a yap yeah i know it's good because it's we don't really associate with a lot of people around here because there's around where the other side of the road there's a lot of drug guys and i'm not interested in drugs oh look at you what you've done here in year territory it's been tough for the first couple days just being around here for a bit all right gregson sounds great i mean you know where're you as hey well i've been around here for about because of working in Adobe the software disappeared a little bit this and Cool. And what's, have you got a message for the Orange Sky people that run this show? Like there's two founders that run Orange Sky, like Nick and Luke as they started it, and then there's a whole big team. What would you say to them if you had a chance to talk to them? Oh, I think it's a fantastic job that they've done. I think unbelievable. I mean, one of the greatest job things that someone could do, because a lot of people haven't got washing machines and they've got no facilities, or they've got to hand wash. You know, if I didn't have the woman next door, or didn't have you, I'd have to do everything by hand, which is a bit of a pain. You know, no, no, it's fantastic service, mate. And it's free. That's the big thing. Yeah. Makes it helpful, yeah. Yeah. So good. Is there anything else you wanted to say to anyone or anything about Orange Sky or about... No, no, nothing more. Yeah. Quite happy with what they do and congratulate the mob that did it, that set it up. So good. Well done. You did do really good.\n",

      "File Name": "Shaun Fisher - Oyster Tour\n",
      "Location": "Stradbroke Island",
      "Type": "Interview",
      "Summary": "Shaun Fisher recounts how his community on North Stradbroke Island reclaims and sustains their land and waters through self-built homes and oyster farming. He describes growing up in Brisbane, eventually returning to the island as a teenager and finding deeper roots in One Mile, an off-grid settlement where families build solar-powered houses, collect rainwater, and rely on each other’s expertise. Oysters hold cultural and economic significance, so Shaun—alongside relatives and mentors—has established commercial leases to harvest them while preserving traditional practices like tripod structures and wild spat catching. Despite barriers such as lack of insurance, limited government support, and regulatory hurdles, the community presses on, seeing oyster farming as both a cultural inheritance and a lucrative business model that can empower future generations. Shaun emphasizes cooperation among kin, local governance by elders, and a determination to provide long-term stability for his children. Overall, he envisions a self-sufficient, culturally grounded economy where his people stand on their own terms and invite outside collaboration only when it aligns with their collective well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Shaun Full Interview\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nShaun Fisher: Just very grateful for it, eh? So. \n\nBenjamin Knight: What's um, how big are the salvos on the island? Like, how much work do they do? \n\nShaun Fisher: Oh, they don't do nothing over here. Oh, really? Nah. Nah, they do nothing. So. Well, not that I know of. Like, yeah. Apart from, yeah, not too much really. \n\nBenjamin Knight: So what are we, what are we doing today? \n\nShaun Fisher: So we're heading up to go get the boat from up one mile, which is where we live.\n\nAnd um, \n\nMilton: Yeah, \n\nShaun Fisher: we'll get up and uh, load the boat up or we loaded the boat this morning. So we'll just hook the boat up and we'll go launch it. Get out. And, uh, put some tripods up. With, um, With the community, so. Part of the school holiday program. [00:01:00] Get out and do Where's, \n\nBenjamin Knight: what's the location of the lease? Has it got a name and sort of \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah.\n\nYeah, so Danbilla. Bay is where we'll be putting the tripods up. And that's up in, uh, Down the south of Dunwich, so. Um, A lot of People can walk there, so I feel the kids will just sort of catch up down at the beach and walk down on the low tide, so that'll make it a lot easier for us and transport and stuff like that, so.\n\nWhat's the \n\nBenjamin Knight: like, um, is there a specific like oyster history in the island type of thing, like is there a meaning to it or is it more like, um, yeah, have there been ebbs and flows as to what oysters mean on the island? \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, I think oysters have always been a part of who [00:02:00] we are. It's one of our main food sources and I think it's just something that you almost take for granted, eh?\n\nBecause like, we um, oh we got, we just got a bitumen roadie yesterday so I've got to put my indicator up in the bush. But, um. Yeah, oysters have always been a part of what we've always done over here on the island. And I think, yeah, we've just always been a bit spoiled in that sense. But yeah, I think it's again, just practicing that in a different form where we're sort of, um, heading along the commercial line, but still today I guess is maintaining those, um, cultural practices.\n\nSo that's what we're doing today with the tripods. This is, um, continuing that for these young ones to, to practice. And as you can see, [00:03:00] like where we are here, um, we've got a few different types of dune pine. Your sheoaks and your cypress, which are the timbers that we are using today. So we're using three different types of timbers.\n\nAnd a part of that would be to see what species, um, grow on them in a bit more. Hey. \n\nMilton: Um, \n\nShaun Fisher: yeah, so, yeah, just being able to continue practicing is, um, one of the biggest things, driving factors for us. And, um, while, you know, we, we look here and then there's all these oyster bags where that's, you know, the commercial side of it.\n\nBeing able to,[00:04:00] \n\nyou know, adapt to those ways, but as well as continuing our connection. Yeah. So, I guess that for us is, yeah, there's ebbs and flows, like you said, um, it has. It's always fluctuated over time, I think, just be careful there, I'm going to reverse it, so, this is um, my spotter, \n\nMilton: so\n\nBenjamin Knight: we're going to put the boat up and, \n\nSpeaker 5: yeah we'll hit, hit the road.[00:05:00] \n\nShaun Fisher: So, yeah, just sort of a new lot of housing. \n\nBenjamin Knight: So is this like the real Australia? Like the people's Australia? And then there's the tourism Australia? This is \n\nShaun Fisher: it. Yeah, this is, this is, this is Stradbroke. \n\nBenjamin Knight: Yeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, this is who we are. And I guess growing up as a young fella like these fellas, I'd always come to One Mile, but One Mile was very small down along the creek when we were younger.\n\nAnd, um It was,\n\nyeah, a lot smaller then. It was a lot tougher for them ones, I think, as well. They did it really tough with, um, like, a lot of their water would come from the creeks. Um, I'm going to have to watch out, son.\n\nSo, like, we're pretty spoilt when it comes [00:06:00] to living in the bush. We've got solar panels. We're on, off the grid totally, so. Rainwater tanks are full from all the rain. Um, yeah, the whole house is self sufficient, so. I think, um, I'm very blessed to have this place. And, um, I'm just going to have to fix this back up, so.\n\nHey Tel, can you close this door, please?[00:07:00] \n\nHow far?\n\nBenjamin Knight: What's the feeling with, like, ownership?\n\nShaun Fisher: I think ownership for us has always been what we know. So as a young fella, again, like coming up here, the houses were, I remember working on one of my great uncles, grandfathers, uncle Dennis's place as a young fella. And like, we sort of come in on the last of it, me and my, one of my brothers, cousins, and we got to build the well.\n\nTower and [00:08:00] um, just how proud he was, you know, like getting to that point of having a whale tower. But again, like I remember coming out and seeing the old drop toilets and um, then I've seen the septics come in and, and then, um, yeah, flushing toilets power and how much those little things that you take for granted really, um, Made a big difference to them and so like it was them that set that precedent for us Now you've got to have running water.\n\nNow, you've got to have electricity and You know that stability was what [00:09:00] we strive for here for our people So then as you can see like we built this house, I think in 2017 we started this place and it started off as\n\nYeah, it was It's just a bare block, but we just, again, being here in one mile, we were building one of my cousin's, um, um, house. And um, I think we were doing a bit on my uncle's place as well, just over there. And it was those seeds that were planted from them ones that continued to water it. And yeah, now it's just multiplied.\n\nAnd as you can see, that's all other houses that are, and then I guess, um, That self [00:10:00] determination, eh, to have, have, um, stability and take back what was ours. So yeah, we just repossessed the land. We just took it back and started building our houses, building our foundations strong so they didn't fall down and continue on that for the next generation.\n\nDo you \n\nBenjamin Knight: feel any like, um, effect or feedback from like general folk around how, how this sort of went about on this part of land? Oh lord, the people haven't. Like, do people talk to you about it? Do they like Yeah, yeah, yeah, most \n\nShaun Fisher: A lot of the residents, Stradbroke Island residents, are really supportive. A lot of, um, community.\n\nBut a lot of them don't understand either. A lot of them go, oh, youse can, youse can do that type of stuff. And youse can [00:11:00] take, you know, build that. But, reality is, we can't get insurance for our houses. So, I think Dunwich is like one of the most fire prone places, um, in, well around here anyways. So, like, some of the big fires that come through here have, um, definitely put the wind up ya as a, as a homeowner, and to be denied to insure your property that's, you know, over half a mil, probably worse.\n\nClose to a mil now, if you put it in those terms of, um, \n\nBenjamin Knight: but The thing I don't think about is, the shocking thing is, disparity between people from Brisbane who come here on holidays and have holiday [00:12:00] homes and rent one out and \n\nShaun Fisher: Yep \n\nBenjamin Knight: The reality \n\nSpeaker 7: for the people that might have been here forever, right? Yep \n\nShaun Fisher: And that's it, like I think, I know people that go We've got a holiday house up in Rainbow Crescent, which is, what's your head son, um, a part of the Dunwich Township, which is only 500 metres up the road.\n\nPretty much this track along the back would be the extension of Rainbow Crescent, so it would be equivalent to those houses that sit up on that hill. Um, so one thing I can say is that They've put a, there's a fire hydrant over here that they only just put in like probably a few months ago. What's your head?\n\n[00:13:00] Which, I did a lot of firefighting, um, fire management and stuff over here and You know, just to have that sense of security to go, you know, if a fire does come through we can sort of tap into that. But we wasn't relying on that type of stuff, you know, we had fire hose, fire hydrants and, I mean, fire, um, pumps and stuff like that, as you can see over here.\n\nThat was again to ensure that we didn't have to be left sort of, um, a bit stuck. So, yeah, I think, um, it's just again fighting for our rights, hey, as Aboriginal [00:14:00] people. And how do we challenge that and how do we go forward? I think, that's what I love about One Mile is because you can continue just challenging that against these systems that have, you know, kept us down.\n\nSpeaker 7: How much is it about people coming together and supporting each other to hear, you know what I mean? Versus, I think like, there's so many strategic ways you can approach things by making relationships with government or philanthropy or like, people have money. But how much do you think is just the people here coming together to support each other?\n\nSpeaker 5: It's \n\nShaun Fisher: powerful. It's pretty powerful. I think what we're doing here is a precedent for a lot of communities. So again, it's taking back what's ours and not waiting for government, not waiting for them to go, Hey, look, we've got this, but you've got to divvy it up and do all this [00:15:00] shit. Excuse my language. And we're just going, you know what, like, come up here and I'll show you this, um,\n\nYou know, part of it, like when we started this project, we built these foundations again, quite strong these for COVID. So my uncle, uncle Dale took me on as a, um, laborer, young chippy and, um, gave me the skills that I needed to, to build this. And so when we started building this, um, me and my family and all my cousins and my uncles.\n\nIt was, um, that empowerment that, again, we can sort of [00:16:00] determine our own outcomes and together we can achieve these things. And so I look at this project as one of the first projects that I was able to be a part of and build for my family and sort of, again, contribute in my generation to, um, So when we built this house originally, we were building, um,\n\nthese, um, rafters outta uh, out of, uh, Cyprus, but we ended up blowing up the chainsaw, and um, we only got this one beam and we milled that out of a Cyprus that was just burnt from one of the, um,\n\none of the trees around one mile. [00:17:00] So originally, yeah, we were supposed to do all these and expose all those rafters like that. This is Davey Hey, this is my younger fella. Hey Davey So yeah, we, we, um, all the bits and pieces like the kitchen we got from Amity. I think we paid like 400 bucks All the timber on the back brander, I got it from a house out point lookout that they were demolishing Um, all the windows just come from everywhere.\n\nI think I was getting on like eBay, I think I paid no more than 50 bucks for all of our windows. Um, this is when the kids protested the jetty. To save the jetty. So my son and a few of the kids led that. And they saved the jetty. That was the picture that This is [00:18:00] when we, um, this is where the house is now.\n\nSo,\n\nit's, uh, this is Kyan, my wife. \n\nSpeaker 7: Sorry, I'm making a little documentary there. \n\nShaun Fisher: No, you're fine. Um, and then, yeah, we sort of built this little project I've got going on here. I'm gonna make some boomerangs. Adom. Yeah, this is home. This is one more. This is a place where we come to rest. I think for me, again, it was um, just setting that place up.\n\nBecause I grew up in Brisbane. And it wasn't until I got to my teens that I was able to come back home here. And [00:19:00] really find myself really grounded. And just find who I was as a young fella. And then to set up this space for my children, so. Yeah, this is it. \n\nBenjamin Knight: What's the, like at a high level, what's the set up with who owns the land at the moment?\n\nLike, is there any, is there any like formal? \n\nShaun Fisher: Nah, I think, I think um, I'm not too sure what goes on there with um, we just, yeah, I don't even acknowledge it in some part. I'll show you down here, the solar. But I guess, I remember when I worked as a ranger, we'd come up here to do a survey on, on the houses.\n\nAnd, Department of, I think it was DNR, Department of Natural Resources. There was some sort of tenure there, over that. But this is how, how the house runs. \n\nSpeaker 8: It \n\nShaun Fisher: runs off these [00:20:00] batteries. So, four batteries run the whole household. And, sometimes we have to kick the jenny in, but the jenny's not good. It's, it's broken.\n\nBut, Yeah, we run off septic. So just like every other \n\nMilton: township. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. Yeah. We, um, just run off septic and that's where that's our sewage.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo yeah, I think, um, just to watch that growth in where we want to head for our people in that unity of coming together and sticking together for that. [00:21:00] I, I, I see it as the same concept as the oystering. So for me with oystering, you know, there's a big, big business there to be tapped into. And I, you know, I think again, it's getting our people into a position where they can lead that and then they can fully take charge.\n\nAnd, um, yeah, any sort of projects going forward for us is, you know, it's going to be setting these next ones up. So there. Creating that. \n\nBenjamin Knight: How do you feel like, um, I've been super impressed with the way in \n\nSpeaker 7: which the strategy, like I've been talking about, you started a partnership. What's that, what's that mean to you in terms of if someone has a way to support this as a whole?\n\nWhat's, what's a partnership look and feel like for you? Especially with people that are not from, from here? [00:22:00] \n\nShaun Fisher: I guess support. And understanding of where it is that we want to go. Um, so I think, to yeah, to just sort of support First Nations grassroots. And what does that look like? It might, like, look like what people think it looks like.\n\nAnd so, I think a lot of people, especially Australia, have a hard time understanding that. Until you come here and see it, you go, shit, this is pretty, pretty big. This is, you know, again, like, the, I've just went and cleared and started building our oyster um, area for our land base. And again, we're not sitting here waiting for these ones, we're just doing it.\n\nWe're just taking back what's ours. Because again, government's sitting there going, Oh, [00:23:00] you know, there's Quandamooka marine aspirations. You know, and you've got to, nah, we're just doing it. We're just taking it back. If we want to be oyster farmers, commercial operators, and again, it's challenging them in a way that it's not just us fish as oysters that are going forward, it's us as a community going forward.\n\nSo again, being able to do it in a way that there's unity and not just operating as a family business as individuals. We're operating on a community level and we're coming to level up and start to, you know, have, have our own table. And if they want to sit at our table, we choose to invite them. And that's the thing, they've got their own table and we're not even invited.\n\nAnd that's how this industry is operating, and it has been for quite some time since they've come here. So that, [00:24:00] back to the oystering. That sort of started off, I don't know, when they first come. And it was more so extraction. So I think 95 percent of the bale, something ridiculous, of extraction, so, they just took away the oysters.\n\nThey didn't, um, I guess, yeah, catch them and, to some degree I think there was stick farming and, You know, that sort of come in the 80s, I think, and a lot of those were like, um, not so much the 80s, but the bags and that all sort of started to come around that time. And then, I think now it's just, yeah, legislations, all those things that push a lot of our mob out.\n\nThat restricted us from staying in the industry. So a lot of our people had to sell up and get out of it. So, a lot of restrictions for our people. Is [00:25:00] there \n\nBenjamin Knight: like a, um, Connection between this idea of governance and legislation, you know what I mean? Like, do you think that \n\nSpeaker 7: you have your own governance on the island that would support all the other shit that legislation stuff is supposed to do with government?\n\nLike, \n\nShaun Fisher: do you \n\nSpeaker 7: your own governance and you'll get to do \n\nShaun Fisher: that? Yeah, most definitely. Like, for, for me, I go straight to my elders, so that's my governance. Um, any discussions, I'll speak directly to my grandfather. And then from that, I'll speak to my uncles and great. And just, yeah, again, that open communication, who, who sort of, who's the expert in those areas as well.\n\nSo if it's housing, it's oyster farming, if it's language, all those things, you sort of know who's the spokesperson for that. [00:26:00] And who holds that, who's the knowledge holder. Um, and so being able to follow those protocols as well. Especially for me as a young fellow, I've got a lot of aspirations. A lot of, and I've got to sort of ground myself.\n\nSo they really ground me in what? As much as I've, you know, try and Yeah, really, um, those are the governance. And those are the ones that steer that for me. \n\nBenjamin Knight: There's so much teaching out there that needs to be done for people that have their own way of doing things. Yep. \n\nMilton: Yep. \n\nShaun Fisher: And that's it, so Um, Do you want to come up and suss out the rest of the house?\n\nLet's go. Let's go.\n\nSo this is our [00:27:00] solar. Runs off an inverter. Well, yeah, it's all that. Um, usually do our washing during the day. But, as you can see, like, again, we're pretty spoiled. That fan runs all the time. Got to build myself an ensuite. So, again, like, just This was out of some Cypress that come, I think I got this for like 10, 20 bucks from Gumtree.\n\nUm, it's again just, yeah.\n\nThese are some old French oars, I swapped these for, um, some fishing rods of Gumtree. So, oh, but yeah, eventually I'll get to the veranda. Uh, yeah. [00:28:00] We sort of started off with just the kitchen and that was um, yeah, little toilet in the backyard and showering the kids out with the hose out the window. When I got this I got, made sure I made sure I got a bath that I could fit in, but you can only use that when the, when it's raining.\n\nWhen it's overflowing. So. But yeah. These are the kids rooms. These are my older boys but, a bit messy these fellas. We got to do this art like, that was a really cool project we got to do with one of my brothers. He got to, yeah. It was um, the twins, these are my twins room. And um, yeah just to give them [00:29:00] that.\n\nNow that's mum. It's mum. It's my girl's room, Kyla. She's the only one that's got her own room. So yeah, that's, that's, that's, yeah. It's one mile in. There's plenty more of these places around, you know, like I think. Yeah, it was just definitely. Alright, boys, let's go.\n\nI'll catch you's up. See you, Davi. \n\nSpeaker 4: See ya, Davy. See ya, Mom. See ya, Davy. See ya. Where's your shirt, Bridget? In the car.\n\nBenjamin Knight: Where did Dale learn how to \n\nShaun Fisher: build? \n\nBenjamin Knight: He built up \n\nShaun Fisher: here. [00:30:00] That's his house. Beautiful, this house. \n\nBenjamin Knight: Um, where did he get the skills for building \n\nShaun Fisher: stuff? He's a carpenter. Um, he learnt as a young fella and that's when he come back and taught me. son and, um, a few others, cousins. And, you know, I think, um, as a young fella, we were very blessed to have that role model.\n\nAnd, you know, a lot of the things, if it wasn't for those people in our lives at that time, I remember I was just a young fella walking along Dunwich and Uncle Dale pulls up and I was, you know, a bit, um, Bit walking around a bit lost and, um, he goes, Hey, do you want some work? And I said, yeah, no worries.\n\nAnd, uh, see ya brother. [00:31:00] Flat out mate. Uh, and, um,\n\nYeah, he said, you want to come hold some ceiling sheets for me? And it was there, then I\n\nfound an interest into timber and carpentry. And I was able to get the skills on the tools and, uh, really helped shape\n\nthat for me as a, Aboriginal man, I, you know, from having that role model that taught me. Taught me how to, um, be a provider for my family and sort of, again, that self determination of, you know, he ran his own business, he wasn't sitting there [00:32:00] waiting, um, so that true, um, determination to bring that change.\n\nAnd that's sort of, with the oystering as well, I've sort of, you know, taken that concept up. What does that look like for me as a business owner? As a, um, so, I'm not dictated by, you know, these\n\nprograms that sort of set us up to fail.\n\nAnd that's where I want to see, you know, the next generation. There's a lot of oyster farms out here, a lot of leases that aren't being worked. They got to come back to the people, you know? Either that or we just start taking them. Which we are, we will. And it's again, to have that position in the industry.\n\nTo have, to be taken serious, you know?[00:33:00] \n\nAnd, to do it in a way where\n\nWe're not staying stagnant. We're, we're, we're just continuing to build and build and build on these young ones, build them up, giving them the support they need to take that on.\n\nHere's them young followers there.\n\nWhich is [00:34:00] a different area for growing, so get different results, a lot cleaner waters, um, a bit more open waters as well, so. Um, a little bit different for growing. So you sort of grow your biggest stuff up here, whereas the one down here south of Dunwich where we're going today to do the work more ideal for a nursery.\n\nSo you're smaller stuff. Um, and so it's sort of important when we're working the bay to have different um, different locations for growing for different outcomes.\n\nHold on.\n\nThis is our [00:35:00] northern lease.\n\nTide looks like it might be um,\n\nwhat's that son? \n\nMilton: Hey? \n\nShaun Fisher: Nah, of course, we've got to get going.\n\nJump off the top. So this has got a little gutter in here. The kids love to swim in here when we get out here and you get to, to see some, jump up there if you want.\n\nSo this is our northern lease. It's um, north of Dunwich. And so this lease is in a bit more [00:36:00] open waters. As you can see we're not. That's a big ray there. Um.\n\nThere's a few mob. Down from, uh, I think Yarrabah. And they've asked to come out and catch some turtles for the Invasion Day Rally. \n\nBenjamin Knight: How about Relationship Colorado? \n\nShaun Fisher: We're just all connected, eh? Uncle Dale and \n\nSpeaker 4: I \n\nShaun Fisher: think those They did it for the Stolen Wealth Games. Down the Gold Coast. Did a protest there and Did a big um, Ozzfisher sort of doing a reef restoration thing with um, in Moreton Bay.\n\nAnd so we've[00:37:00] \n\nBenjamin Knight: How long's this been here? \n\nShaun Fisher: These leases? I don't know if it was um,\n\nI don't know if it's, uh, 1900s or whenever they started to market out and call them leases. But, um, you see that, so where we put these, there's sort of an old reef, oyster reef. And over time, I think, because of the over extraction of these, of the bay. You get the, uh, drills they call them, and so the ecosystem's out of whack.\n\nSo none of these, anything that tries to grow and get established, nothing grows because the, well, the, these, um, drills are smashing them. So [00:38:00] Any old reef is really struggling to continue building on it.\n\nBenjamin Knight: What's the process of regeneration you reckon? \n\nShaun Fisher: Furniture. So pretty much what we've done there. Um, I think those tripods are a bit big. We've sort of done a bit of an overkill, but I think many of those and other sort of, um, furniture that can sort of create a bit of a hiding spot, but somewhere they can just keep building off.\n\nIt's a good foundation. And with that I think you can Just slowly start to build these [00:39:00] micro ecosystems and then hopefully then over time they just But see with marine parks and all those types of things, a lot of those things dictate and hinder But what we're doing here Um It was a challenge for me to even purchase my own lease Um, but it was the only way I feel that I could get taken serious enough.\n\nSo, Yeah, there's a lot of those legislations and stuff that dictate outcomes for restoration and, um, oyster farming.\n\nBut, um, Yeah, it's just trying to navigate through those things and keep that going for these fellas. So, [00:40:00] that's um, sort of.\n\nWatch that motor.\n\nYou sure? Should I get your brother?\n\nWe're not jumping no more. Alright, sit down now, we've got to get going. Everyone's waiting for us. It's a really awesome lease for um, because it's up against the island. It's really good for a nursery.[00:41:00] \n\nThey had to get someone to secure it. Um, so that's still in process. So it's um, early stages of even being able to get it back into community. So, I think again, but, if you're not in this or privy to that information, you're not going to be privy to those opportunities that come up. Alright, come back. So it's just again, that unity, working together for the bigger picture stuff.\n\nAnd, \n\nSpeaker 4: where we \n\nShaun Fisher: want to go, I think, Milton, I'm waiting for you so we can go please. Um. Is create traineeships, create job opportunities for these young ones, but also for our men. And, um, again, work in the bay to, to, [00:42:00] to advantage those outcomes. And to get the best outcomes of actual oyster farming. So again, having locations like that, having locations like that.\n\nHaving locations south of Dunwich where they're going to get a lot more fatter, a lot earlier. So the oysters south of Dunwich, because they're such high, um, foods that come out of the rivers. That's where those oysters will fatten a lot quicker. But up here, the cleanliness of the water, the open waters in the, this is the Rainbow Channel, best oysters ever.\n\nYou can't get any better. But they fatten a lot later in the season. So, work in the bay, um, yeah, to get the best outcomes.\n\nAlright.[00:43:00] \n\nSpeaker 8: Have you been out there helping Dad on the oyster leaves? Yep.\n\nSpeaker 10: And this is\n\nBen. All the people you can ask questions to. And Sean. \n\nMilton: And Uncle Phil. Hey Milton. Um, sorry? You want to talk us through what you want to do? \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, okay. I gotta, I gotta set this pump up, so this will help us jet these um, poles in. Post. [00:44:00] And, just sorta, Yeah, just set them in. So they don't go anywhere. It's coming in.\n\nWell, it's, this is dead low. So, Um,\n\nYeah, so I'll set these up, so these, this is just a fire pump, firefighter pump, and we use that to set all of our posts in, so everything out on the farm, so all those posts we did with this, um, and, yeah, it's sort of. a tough way of farming. So \n\nBenjamin Knight: what's, what's, where's this fitting relation to how most people do it?\n\nLike, is this, uh, \n\nShaun Fisher: this style of farming here in Moreton Bay is common. [00:45:00] So a lot of. current farmers are using bag and line systems. Um, so they'd use this to put their posts in, which I'll show you soon. I'll go over and show you what, what our bags are and what style of farming is currently used. With a lot of the commercial farmers now, um, so That sort of being said, we're, we're Today sort of putting these three different timbers, the Cypress June Pine and the um, She Oak And with uh, UQ Ben, Ben Moss and the crew and the holiday program Um, we can put these in with the kids and Sort of monitor what?\n\nover the next few years, what grows on it, what species, [00:46:00] um, and, um, yeah, sort of target what we're trying to achieve for food and food safety for our next generation. And continue in those old ways our people have always farmed, so Yeah, that's What we're doing today, and then With that\n\nSort of Showing them that process from the start. So step one, this is how we catch the oysters This is how Well, yeah, get you throw that one in catch the oysters. This is how we When we come back to harvest the oysters. And the best times to sort of catch and all the rest of it as well. So just sort of studying the bay.[00:47:00] \n\nStudying what that\n\nlooks like. Just getting them all in tune and sync with it all. I think it's perfect age for a lot of these young ones now to start learning. And Back down there. Hey, can you take this out? As far as you can that way. And I'll slowly feed it out to \n\nSpeaker 9: you. \n\nShaun Fisher: It's alright.\n\nManny, here you go. It's footy training. Where's \n\nSpeaker 4: the Bubba? \n\nShaun Fisher: Where's he? He's with Mum. \n\nSpeaker 4: Where's mom? \n\nShaun Fisher: Over town. \n\nSpeaker 4: Oh, so it's just you and the boys [00:48:00] today? \n\nShaun Fisher: Just me and the boys today, yeah. Just um, Yeah, me and the boys, so. What's this coming for now? So this is gonna put the post in. We're gonna,\n\nI've gotta prime it. So, I think the best thing is to\n\nclimb this as well. Stuff that's floating in the back there behind them posts.\n\nThey're called oyster pods, cages. And um, there's other, lot of different floating stuff. [00:49:00] Um, and it's all really, um, new stuff as well, so, a lot of trials and research going into that type of stuff. But, yeah, there's some, um, things that, um, Need to \n\nBenjamin Knight: So they just anchor into the ground? \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, there's two anchors either end.\n\nAnd then they're sort of joined by rope. So, with that Um Hey, do you want to hold on to that? Hold on!\n\nYeah, I just want to try and I'm scared! \n\nSpeaker 4: Put in this hole. \n\nShaun Fisher: So, come in.\n\nBring it in.[00:50:00] \n\nBenjamin Knight: Stand him up. Alright, next one. Stand him up. Next one.[00:51:00] \n\nOne type of wood on each leg of the tripod.\n\nYeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: Take that one over there to Wait up, sorry, which one's which? Yeah, we've got three here. Okay, \n\nMilton: so \n\nShaun Fisher: What we're gonna do, we're just gonna\n\nSink these in. Just so they, see how they float. We don't want them floating away. So, this is the post.\n\nSo we can [00:52:00] um,\n\nso this one here, we put them in as a shiego.\n\nWatch out please, that's very dangerous.\n\nHere, pull right there. This one here, this is a cypress here. Last[00:53:00] \n\none,\n\nthis one's a dune pine.\n\nDune pine. Yeah, this one here, smooth the bark, I think. But then, watch out, watch out. Alright, let go. Don't do that.\n\nYeah, different. Yeah. [00:54:00] Different, uh,\n\nweight up. So this one will catch a lot more than this one. Yeah, yeah. But \n\nthis one's a harder timber too. So it'll last probably a lot longer. This one, I reckon, \n\nMilton: um, \n\nShaun Fisher: Mangrove worm. So. Yeah.\n\nAlright, we'll do the last one out here, very deep.\n\nThe new infrastructure, from, um, from us that we put in. And this is some of the old stuff from the old farmers that used to farm here. But um, [00:55:00] this lease again being sort of sheltered and only the Westleys. Similar to the, to the Northern Shack as well Jen. Um, this is what I'll use for my nursery. So, and then um,\n\nyeah. Sort of housing all the smaller stuff and then, oh, yes.\n\nSo these oysters here I have sort of separated, um, what's that, there's [00:56:00] 12 here. So these ones,\n\nthese ones are from the hatchery. These are the ones that, that we got that day. So I'll grab some out. \n\nMilton: So \n\nShaun Fisher: these are the baby oysters. \n\nSpeaker 5: Um, \n\nShaun Fisher: so the department of fisheries or DPI, they mob, hatch these in the hatchery up in Bribie Island. And um, I think they did them mid last year and we were able to pick these up.\n\nUm, so a lot of us, a lot of farmers in Moreton Bay got these to trial and these are called the Sunshine Oyster, [00:57:00] so lineage G. And um, yeah, so they're all, they're all little, yeah. So we've \n\nBenjamin Knight: How do they move? What's the process of like So Nurse, reconditioner, \n\nShaun Fisher: paramedic, partner? I guess Um Move, what do you, I mean, like, um These ones, I'll show you how small they They were when we got them, so they're Pretty Tiny.\n\nIf we go down here. Physically motivated? \n\nBenjamin Knight: Yeah, so\n\nShaun Fisher: These ones will stay in here and it's just managing the overcatch. So, as they grow, we put [00:58:00] roughly 1. 5 litres per bag. So you've got to, as they grow, you've got to manage it. These ones are wild caught ones, so these are caught from Moreton Bay. And that's the spat that's, um, grown here in the bay. So, these, um, Around, around the same time, maybe a little bit older, probably from last year's winter catch or something.\n\nSo I got them from, from Dylan, um, one of the other brothers that farm. He, yeah? Um, I was there. Did ya? Did you bring a knife? \n\nMilton: No. \n\nShaun Fisher: So, yeah, so moving these, so you gotta move them, so, you can see all this stuff is, [00:59:00] um, these bags are only very new. Milton tellin\n\nYeah, these are the same, these are the um, wild caught ones. So you're just grading them as you, as you, um. Sort of sorting out. So you sort out your front runners, which are your faster growing oysters, and then you'll have your runts which don't grow as fast as the others and then Which these ones here are the runts from the hatchery.\n\nSo I'll show you how How these have sort of\n\nSort of stayed as runts. So they're the same age as the first ones that we had a look at. I'll show you, Jen. \n\nSpeaker 9: These are,\n\nShaun Fisher: These \n\nSpeaker 10: are [01:00:00] the babies. \n\nShaun Fisher: So they're the ones that we call runts. They don't grow as fast as the, As the other ones. So they're the same age as the first ones we had a look at. Yeah. Same age, they're the ones that we picked up that day. Um, so these ones just don't grow as well. \n\nMilton: Are they also the sunshine?\n\nShaun Fisher: They're the sunshine, yeah. So again, we've been able to sort them out and sort which ones are going to be our good ones. Yeah. And which ones are our not good ones. So \n\nMilton: you've got to do all that manually? \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. Unless you can get some big, um, high tech stuff. But for now, yeah, we just sorted that by hand. So\n\nYeah, yeah, um To be honest, I only brought these out last week. [01:01:00] Yeah, so I brought these out last week and As they grow I think I'll give them another few. Oh, they're a bit bit old a not much to eat No. Spill them, we don't have any big ones for yous to eat. \n\nMilton: Yeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: None. I'll put them in here, look. \n\nSpeaker 9: Where, where, where are they?\n\nBenjamin Knight: Oh, \n\nShaun Fisher: did you want that? It's gone now. \n\nBenjamin Knight: When's the next, like, harvest type situation? Or when's the next, um, the oysters office sort of? Yeah, \n\nShaun Fisher: so for me, I gotta buy in some oysters. So if I can buy in some oysters from another farmer. And we can try and get that cash flow and that will help sort of keep that consistency of the business building.\n\nBenjamin Knight: These \n\nShaun Fisher: ones will be about three years. So from spat to, hey, jump off [01:02:00] there. He's going to break my ropes. Off the ropes, Milton, Milton, Milton, Milton. \n\nSpeaker 9: Milton, get off! \n\nShaun Fisher: Milton! We're all looking at you, son. You're on the post. So, yeah, about three years. Um, to the end product, so. Bit of work there, but. It's, um. \n\nBenjamin Knight: But then, after three years, you're kind of like working at Elks.\n\nShaun Fisher: See, with the wild caught stuff, you want to be able to not miss a catch. So every time, we'll go over here and have a look at these. Milton, if I got to speak to you again son, you're gonna be in big trouble. \n\nSpeaker 4: Alright, \n\nShaun Fisher: get off the lines. Um,[01:03:00] \n\nyeah, these are the floating ones. So if you just want to come have a look at these ones, these are the floating There's nothing in here, but Go\n\nSpeaker 9: get \n\nShaun Fisher: that spear Milton\n\nWhy are they all flipped? Because I'm cleaning the barnacles off them so that's the idea around the floating stuff is\n\nBen Ben mate \n\nBenjamin Knight: So\n\nShaun Fisher: the idea around the floating stuff [01:04:00] Compared to say that stuff to make it manageable into sort of upscale and go large You have to go to this floating stuff Which Allows you to manage your over catch so your over catches your barnacles your baby spat oysters all those types of things that grow And so, here, mate.\n\nUm, The way that these work usually is the way that they are now. But to then manage that overcut, once a month you'd flip them over for a certain amount of time. So you'd flip them for about a day. Considering weather dependent as well, so. Um, if you leave them longer you'd leave them for maybe three to four days to manage that.\n\nIf you left that length here a [01:05:00] little bit longer, so. That's the idea. If you want to go along and flip all these over boys, um,\n\nand then How\n\nBenjamin Knight: many of these would you have at each? There's an ideal number of these that would make it. \n\nShaun Fisher: Bob? \n\nBenjamin Knight: Yeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: I'm looking like, 400, 500 \n\nSpeaker 4: would be the ideal. \n\nShaun Fisher: So these are 500 a pop. These are only a trial that we're doing but, cause these are a new make, these are still in very early stages of, like some of these are.\n\nSo [01:06:00] production hasn't been around quite long enough to fine tune it. \n\nBenjamin Knight: These \n\nShaun Fisher: have been knocked off from a design in Canada. So another farmer that's just down the road created these. He's um, So where, where's, you got other big players in the game that have been around quite some time and they've only just brought out the product that they've been trialing in Canada or in America.\n\nAnd it's a lot better make, it's a plastic, so it doesn't degrade and Yeah, so there, that's a new way of farming. Um, that we're all sort of looking at going here in Moreton Bay. So it's just, [01:07:00] technology's all very, um, new stuff. But, a lot, yeah, a lot of different ways as well, so, just trying to get at that.\n\nWhat, what best suits your farm as well, so. Yeah. I can take you down here and show you what the spat catchers are. That way I can grab that spear. Um, So the idea, Um,\n\nAround This farm again is more so the nursery, Hatchery, Um, farm for fish as oysters. And so this is where we'll be able to sort of walk from the land. This is all [01:08:00] usually dry as well. When we come out here on the low tide and then um, it's a lot easier to sort of but as we gradually grow and things like pontoons and bigger punts that are work boats and things like that.\n\nUm, more infrastructure like that will just definitely enhance the business and we'll be able to sort of, yeah, look at\n\nbigger opportunities, I guess, is getting these young ones involved.\n\nAnd so as I, like as a young fella growing up here, you know, we'd come out, go mud crabbing and, um,\n\ncome along here and, You know, you'd see your oyster farmers out here and [01:09:00] stuff, and it was never inviting for us. There was never a place that we were sort of encouraged to go, so for me it's about encouraging these young ones, getting them involved, and giving them their spot out here on country. Like that, there, look at them, they're gonna.\n\nWrecked the pods. But, it's what it's about. It's trial and error. Having a go, having a crack. Seeing where, where it takes us.\n\nSo, I built that for our spat catchers. And so the idea for that is to catch all of our oysters. Catch all the babies. And um, [01:10:00] These, these spat catchers in here are,\n\nthese are from uh,\n\nthe previous farmer that I bought the farm off. So he's had his spat catchers out here.\n\nAnd so what he's used here is um, some old PVC pipe.\n\nRight, so you see here, that's your [01:11:00] baby oysters there, that's your spat, that's them there. That's how you catch them.\n\nAnd so again, being in tune with that, so there's certain times of the year, you got your winter catch, you got your summer catch, and again studying the, studying the bay to get the best results. It's \n\nBenjamin Knight: such a simple walk, it's just a mechanism that, \n\nShaun Fisher: yeah, yeah. So there's a lot of\n\ninteresting things you can learn from being out here and, yeah. I think we better get these kids out of here, eh? [01:12:00] Before it all goes,\n\nthat tide's turning pretty quick. I wonder whose bag this is?\n\nOh, it'll get over your head here.\n\nYeah, so that's oyster farming and that process from step one, just trying to catch the oysters. And then not missing a cycle, because if you miss a cycle You miss\n\nBenjamin Knight: your harvest. Or like a bit of a philosophy, right, of like, that community can start to [01:13:00] feel as well, right? Like if you miss the next generation, you've lost another one in the box, right? \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. It's a good one, isn't it? Oh yeah. And that's it. That's where I think, um, for a lot of us, not being in tune with who we are.\n\nHow do we be in tune with who we are? Our identity and what really grounds us as a people? And I think, yeah, this is it here. There\n\nBenjamin Knight: are a few things that give you hope, I suppose. Because I've been cruising around, like, Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs and Palm Island. Every community's got their different challenges. Strobe Road's got something about it, which is like a, I don't know, bit of a flight, a bit of like a grounding to something, something different anyway.[01:14:00] \n\nYeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: Um,\n\nwhat was the question? \n\nBenjamin Knight: Oh I know, I just feel like when Rich came here he was astounded. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. \n\nBenjamin Knight: There's some kind of energy that he got from being here. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. Like I don't \n\nBenjamin Knight: know, do you know what that is? Or do you know how to represent that? \n\nShaun Fisher: I guess we just live it, hey? \n\nBenjamin Knight: Yeah. \n\nShaun Fisher: That's, that's the biggest thing.\n\nLike I think, just living\n\nand adapting to Like, where we are, look at that big mullet, um, on the doorsteps of Brisbane, Brisbane City, you know, and so many distractions here, so many influences for tourism and, um, you know, for everybody else, but us. And I think, to not be given the crumbs. And to compromise [01:15:00] that is something that I'm aware of.\n\nAnd not to just be content with what they're putting out on the table, you know. So again, creating our own table. And if we choose to invite them to sit there, That's on our term. So, I think again, it's just not compromising on some things, but also not being stuck in that one way of thinking. Of um, of being, I guess, trapped from,\n\nyou know, those, those influences or, or challenges or barriers or, And I think it comes back to just, Staying connected here with your mob and knowing when [01:16:00] to go and sort of where to focus your energy and put that as well, so it's definitely got its challenges, yeah, it's not easy, but yeah just very grateful to be able to see it from these young fellas lens, you know, and sort of go, yeah, I was there.\n\nAnd I can remember being chased off these leases.\n\nAnd you just don't have to run like we did. You just can stand there proud. A bit of ownership. \n\nBenjamin Knight: Even at like case studies stuff and being able to show like, my vision over the next five years and, in five years time you're, traveling the world showing people what you did or like, yeah.\n\nShaun Fisher: [01:17:00] Yeah, that's, that's what it's about building that model for me again, so they can strive for something so they can see it, feel it, touch it, be a part of it. And if there's anything that I can sort of take away from this whole journey, it's, it's about, yeah, just giving them that position.\n\nAnd being able to do it, um, where we're fully supported from mob and, yeah, that's where we want to go. \n\nBenjamin Knight: That whole analogy of the table is so interesting, like, yes, I see what's happening with a new government and, like, I think they released 500 million dollars to support, like, Fixing youth crime or something, but never in [01:18:00] that one.\n\nThat outlook was like, what are you doing? \n\nShaun Fisher: Thanks, boss.\n\nBenjamin Knight: Yeah. It's confusing for me to be here and then. And eating over there and being like, there's no understanding or even follow through or want to come and understand this shit. \n\nShaun Fisher: That's right. And that's for me, again, like not sitting there waiting for these followers. And again, I feel that's a way of suppressing our people with dangling the carrot always, you know.\n\nWhereas I see a lot of these farmers, whether they're black or not, a lot of them, you know, I see, I think they could have been doing this a lot earlier for our mob. And again, to me, coming from [01:19:00] being a young fella, being out here, not being excluded, but Not being invited either. And that's what I think it's about.\n\nThat's where it's changing for us.\n\nAlright, better get these ones in the boat. Stuff like, what,\n\nSince we've been able to get into the commercial sector of oyster farming and look at the potentials of what that could look like for us,\n\nthere's always been talk about,\n\nyou know, uh, co [01:20:00] ops and, um,\n\nand, uh,\n\nour mob sort of leading those co ops.\n\nAnd it was always just talk around, you know, the land, the leases are being sort of handed back to the mob, and sort of government um, returning the farms that aren't being used, which is I'd have to say I don't know the actual numbers, but I'd say a good 80 percent of the farms in the bay aren't being used.\n\nI'd even say it could be higher.[01:21:00] \n\nMoira Springs, which is a fresh spring, that feeds into the bay and they're just constantly running. And [01:22:00] so that allows, that sort of contributes to a lot of the A lot of the oyster spat in\n\nthis area, so a lot of the oysters, this is a high catching area so because of,\n\nbecause it being such a high catching area, this area would be ideal for um, setting up your spat catchers. And you'd have us talking to a farmer down there. [01:23:00] And they have somewhere between, you know, 8, 000 spat catchers. So, when we're looking out, catching our own wild caught spat, and then, um,\n\nsort of, that process from the start of catching it, but, I think if you don't have that right, Well then, what,\n\nwhat sort of hopes do you have in the industry, you know? So I think, um, having that as a good starting point, um, for, for farming. So this area here, elders are still in the [01:24:00] process of securing, but they've secured it, um, to a point where, you know, we're good. have some sort of hope for our children's future in the industry and sort of start to look at, well, what do these pro, projects look like?\n\nAgain, catching the spat, um, and\n\nstarting that process from the start. So,\n\nthis um, farm sort of come about from one of my mates. You can see, um, Um, rang me up and knew I was sort of in the, in the game and said, Hey, look, there's this guy. He wants to buy this lease, um, would you be willing to, um, work it for him? I said, Oh yeah. What, which lease is it? [01:25:00] And he's telling me, he goes, Oh, I said, send me some pictures.\n\nHe sent me some pictures and it was this, I said, I couldn't believe it, you know, because These guys were asking some big dollars and I just said oh look how do I get this and I racked my brain and I was trying to work out how to secure it and you know thinking about processes um but to not let it slip away as well and I had one of my Other mates, he's a farmer and um, sort of spoke to him about it and he was, he was pretty interested as well and he, he had the money, he had it all, he had it ready to go and I said nah mate, like this is, this is our opportunity to sort of, you've got to sort of sit back and wait for us, like if we can't secure this, um.\n\nThen, you know, [01:26:00] you might be able to have a go, but until then, you can wait and, and this is a thing for a lot of our mob, is if we don't have the money or the capital to sort of secure these leases, these fellas are coming in and they're just taking it. Big sharks they are, they're sharks, they're just taking everything.\n\nSo this lease here, when we come out, I come out with my, one of my uncles, my grandfather's, my great uncle's, grandfather's brother. I've got a turtley a lot. And um,\n\nwhen we come out, he was telling the yarn about when they used to shoot, shoot at them. What's the, what's \n\nBenjamin Knight: the steps of making this happen though? Like, what's the We've\n\nShaun Fisher: got to get a business plan together. \n\nBenjamin Knight: It's \n\nShaun Fisher: a [01:27:00] community business plan. So we get that together. A lot of people don't want to invest their time into it but, you know, a lot of commercial farmers, they don't want to share that. They don't want to It's all for themselves. And so I think For me, like It's again, like we shared, it's about the next generation and not having to compete with these other people coming in and buying up all the land and taking all our opportunities away from us.\n\nAnd so when they come and they come and they reap the benefits of Our land or our seas, they'll come and they'll go, and we'll always be here, and so for me it's about building that foundation for the next generation, and building it strong. And so,[01:28:00] \n\nthat there was a big win for us and our community. And it's again, very early stages, we haven't secured it fully. So, once we're able to, you know, go to the, I think it's the ILSC, Dignitas Land and Sea Corporation. But, you know, we're not guaranteed anything as well. So, And when I had to purchase, when I purchased my leases again, it was just, nowhere near.\n\nAs much as this, because of the infrastructure, because of the location as well, and I guess what it has to sort of offer, compared to say, a bare lease like mine, so. \n\nBenjamin Knight: Do you have an understanding about what, like, a certain amount of capital or support would you use at the moment, or [01:29:00] would you already be?\n\nLike if someone came to you and said they have, \n\nShaun Fisher: like, a party, would you happily believe it?\n\nThe changes that it would bring to our community, would generate, yeah, massive. It'd be massive, so. Yeah, look, again, like I think if, given the right opportunities and given, the chance, and with the right people in the right positions, it would be a game changer for our community. for our people. And so, Moreton Bay, a lot of it's Koontamooka country.\n\n[01:30:00] a lot of, um, the oyster leases in Queensland are in Moreton Bay. And so, I'd have to say a good,\n\nyeah, a good lot of them. So, a lot of the industry comes from Moreton Bay. Up here in Queensland. And, um, it's just setting that up, so, yeah. With the understanding as well that it's always to stay within our community, so we can set that business up. And as we sort of set up as like a co op, you know, the business or the community would sort of, how I see it.\n\nCommunity structure would sort of, uh, distribute the oysters. [01:31:00] And so each farmer, to sort of make it easier for them, they could feed into that. And then they just distribute all at the one outlet. And that's how I sort of see it, uh,\n\nPanning out for us. That's \n\nBenjamin Knight: certainly like the foundation here, right, for people to walk into opportunities just to, on offer, if no one offers them like that. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, \n\nBenjamin Knight: yeah. It's like that's, we've got to build the, need, the capacity on the island to be like, reading, games and all that. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. Hatcheries. Yeah. Um, massive.\n\nYou know, and that, there we can then, a lot of the, the farmers, current farmers are buying their spat from the southern state. So they're buying that all up. [01:32:00] We could be all catching it all here. \n\nBenjamin Knight: Is it like, if they can sit here, they can start to look at more variable levels of the \n\nShaun Fisher: ecosystem? Yeah. So you'd have, um, you know, working closely with ones like Ben on, um, research projects.\n\nMm. Adding species as well. So. Testing\n\ndifferent, um, species, trialling, um, different methods and different, um, yeah, ways. So, I don't know if it's too early to talk or share about it, but another farmer, one of the big boys here, [01:33:00] he's doing some stoffing up. We've had an opportunity to secure these leases over here. And, they're, I'll probably share it, but we'll, I don't know, we'll, we'll see what we can share with others.\n\nBut, um, so I've been offered three of these leases to buy for the, for the community. And this one's pretty controversial about the wave suppression and marine pox. in their legislations. So we're currently going through a process of a development approval, a DA, to allow for us to start trialing, um, wave suppression, which is the open waters that we're in.\n\nAnd so wave suppression being, um, the way of oyster farming in, um, Moreton [01:34:00] Bay. And because it's such early We've sort of had a road farmer from the southern states come up in the last, I don't know, four or five years. And um, he's gone and he's developed this wave suppression and he sort of again come up and made contact and said, Hey, look, I think, I think this is your story.\n\nHe's doing a story with a landline and they're doing a story on the wave suppression. And he goes, I think it'd be much better had that story, I said, yeah, no, I think that's a good idea. Um, so that being said, like they want a few million for it. It'll have like, but we could potentially be the biggest oyster farmers in [01:35:00] Queensland from that opportunity.\n\nSo I believe like, there is good farmers out there that really want to see us be successful. As Kondamooka original owners of this country. And I think if we can work closely with ones like Colin Goldcoast Oysters, I think, again, it'll be a game changer. They've got the evidence, they've got the backing.\n\nUm, you know, and I think he's put in the work to make it sort of, um, achievable for us. So I think, um, that being said, yeah, I think still early days and if we lose that opportunity or someone else comes in and takes it from us, we'll, you know, I [01:36:00] think it'd be somebody else's story. So,\n\nhe's one, um, one of the knowledge holders here, one of the brothers that's taught me how to farm and went on. Started off in West End Markets, me and my family, started off, we were selling these oysters here, these are grown out here in um, Myora, out in the reef hole, that's the Rainbow Channel there, and then out there's your, some of your cleanest waters you'll get in Moreton [01:37:00] Bay.\n\nSo when we, yeah, started selling oysters, we were selling Dylan's oysters and we just started off in, in the markets out West End and we could have really went, you know, and just fall into production, but it wasn't where I wanted to be. I wanted to be out here on country. And so to sort of get again, to be taken serious and given an opportunity.\n\nUm, I guess network outside of community because you can get sort of stuck in a bubble here. Um, it wasn't until we started meeting people in those types of areas that we sort of go, a lot of people would come up and go, Oh, we, we own Worcester Farms Australia. I've never seen you, never seen you in my whole life.\n\nUm. But a lot of people did. [01:38:00] And so it was then that we were able to sort of,\n\nUm, be taken serious from the department. They come in, they took a few pictures of us and put a post up on their, uh, put a post on their, um, LinkedIn. Did you know, um, Moreton Bay has a native oyster? Talking about \n\nMilton: blackfellas. \n\nShaun Fisher: And so we were just, again, me and my children selling oysters in the market. And that was the seed.\n\nThat was where we planted it. That was where, from that, we were able to then secure two leases by the end of that season. And from that, we were able to Yeah, it's start to practice. Oyster farming and, you know, years before that I was out here [01:39:00] working with a few of these other farmers and, um, working, um, volunteering and sort of trying to learn the art of actual oyster farming and, as you've seen earlier today when we were up at one mile, my concept was, I'm just going to take my lane, my lane.\n\nMy leases and all my, my farms and my land back and start to really practice it. But a lot of these fellows that I was volunteering with didn't really want to see that they want to see me take back my land and start building. So I wasn't able to go anywhere in that way. So I had to purchase that lease.\n\nAnd when I did that, then I was able to apply for a lease. Which give me my boat motor. So I look at it like, [01:40:00] Yeah, just trying to Go forward and not stay stagnant. As a commercial operator. But first First and foremost, as, as an Aboriginal man, I think,\n\nthat's, you know, we're Aboriginal all the time, so, when these ones that were sitting in these, um, associations and stuff like that, that speak on behalf of the, the uh, commercial operators, no one's speaking for my people, you know? No one's got our people's intentions.\n\nOr they only want you to be Aboriginal sometimes. So, we can't switch off. We just [01:41:00] gotta, it's either on or off. So when we're having these discussions, just knowing when to put those hats on, you know? And keep it on or off. But I think, again, to be able to build that momentum in the industry, but, and then to be approached by ones like this farm here, and potentially secure this one, and take that on and, you know, I think there's people's reasons why they would look.\n\nopportunities, the harsh conditions of growing out here. Um, and you know, there's other talks of bringing in another species that would just [01:42:00] definitely be a game changer to the industry. So there's talks of the Pacific oysters that they want to bring them in and they'd start those trials down in the southern.\n\nend of Moreton Bay. And that would allow, because that oyster grows a lot quicker than the rock oyster, than your local native oyster, your higher turnovers. So you'll be able to,\n\nso you know, like I think, in their eyes there's a need, there'll be no need for these types of banks out here. But for us, I think, it's an opportunity to be able to even look at Um, Yeah, upscaling and full commercial sized production. So again, like this, this here is the wave suppression [01:43:00] and a lot of work's been put into this and a lot of thought from Colin and for him again to even consider us as the first buyers, I think,\n\njust very grateful for that opportunity. What \n\nMilton: is it sir? \n\nShaun Fisher: Uh, Gold Coast Oysters. So he's, he's been building this over the last few years. So this[01:44:00] \n\nis a full size commercial scale oyster farm in Moreton Bay. Probably one of the biggest growers in\n\nQueens, it is the biggest grower in Queensland.\n\nWonder if he'll give us some oysters. Nah.\n\nSo what's coming up? This could potentially be House.[01:45:00] \n\nSo the idea behind the wave suppression is, obviously, the wave suppression and slowing that chop down so, when you come in\n\nand um,\n\nlook at all the fish.\n\nBenjamin Knight: So what do you see when you look at that in terms of what you want to do? \n\nShaun Fisher: I guess, \n\nsometimes. For me it's, I've got to pinch myself, [01:46:00] eh, like, I'll go to the farm that we were at today, to my farm, then I think, um, are these discussions real, you know, like, are these, uh, is this a reality for us? Because I think again like, I've heard these my whole life, these discussions happen and never have I ever been offered.\n\nAnd the only thing that's stopping us is money. That's the only thing that's stopping us right now in between us owning this, even though we own the whole bay. \n\nBut \n\nI think again, that's true reconciliation.\n\nAnd that's the biggest oyster farmer in Queensland offering us that as an opportunity to take on. [01:47:00] And I don't think there's many other farmers that really give a shit about us when it comes to They make out like they do, but they don't give a shit\n\nBenjamin Knight: and interesting at all. Like the flow of money. It's not money. That's almost like an investment that goes through a business that then goes into sustainability. It's investment, a whole people. That's, it's a hard thing. Fat of fucking normal. \n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. I think for me, like it's about. security for us as a, as a nation, as a people.\n\nAnd that's what I look at when I look at this. This is our, our food banks. These are ours.\n\n[01:48:00] And so if we were given that opportunity to take that on, that knock on effect. It would have then for my grandchildren to go, Oh, yeah, no, we, we are a part of that. We are always the farmers and\n\nwe are the people from Kondamooka and\n\nagain, to, there's one thing to sort of\n\nbe recognized as a rightful owners, but I think again, when it's Played out and\n\nin the way of um,\n\nagain having that position taken [01:49:00] serious. We're not just talking about. A few little oyster farms. We're talking about multi million dollar businesses that are going to generate\n\nhealth and well being. That's what it's about. It's about being out here on country. Being able to sustain our people. And to do it in a way that we can do that comfortably. Not having to feel like that weight's on us. That we can do it in a way where we don't have to feel like we're dragging ourselves along.\n\nWe can do it comfortably, you know? Instead of doing three trips, we do one trip in a big boat.\n\nStuff like that.[01:50:00] \n\nInstead of, you know, spending an hour sorting\n\na hundred dozen, you can spend an hour sorting 30, 000 dozen, you know? It's about upscale and being able to do it in a way that we can manage it. And for our mob too, you know, our mob that's coming home,\n\nHow do we facilitate that, you know? How do we facilitate our people trying to reconnect? And with the population growth as well, you know, like, it's crazy. So just making sure, again, we're secured.\n\nLook at all these big mullets. It's[01:51:00] \n\nBenjamin Knight: like a big living ecosystem, right? Yeah.\n\nShaun Fisher: Yeah, and that's it. It would have been, yeah. So yeah, I think this is two farms in one, leases that have been joined as one.\n\nSo yeah, I think, I don't know if we're allowed to disclose that, but that's what.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Felicity Davis-Smith\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nBe as small as what I'm, yeah. Which are very typically masculine traits. And for someone who's binary trans, like I am, like as in trans woman, don't identify in between or anything like that. All good with people that do, but it's a bit off putting that you've gotta carry the voice and there's yeah. Yeah, I can. Yeah. So cool. So I'm just gonna clap my hands. Yep. Sync my sound. Okay. And all you gotta do is tell me your full name and Yep. This is not there. This is just me. Yeah. Cool. So you just tell your full name and spell it just so I've got it on the video. Yeah, sure. So my name is Felicity Davis Smith.\n\nAnd the spelling is F-E-L-I-C-I-T-Y. D-A-V-I-S hyphen S-M-I-T-H. Cool. Yeah. And so my first question is usually how do you like to identify yourself? Talk about yourself, introduce yourself. You [00:01:00] can take whatever. So I go by flick. I'm she, her. But I'm not real. I'm not a prissy princess about it, buddy.\n\nI basically get there and if someone's bro, oh man. I'm like, okay, whatever. I, I played that male character for 30 damn years, so it's took been a long time to go you started in the hood and you're just gonna go and do it anyway. And if any of them give you a hard time, you'd be like, all right, let's go outside and settle this old school.\n\nYou wanna play like that? I grew up in the same place as you buddy. But no, in all seriousness, like I, I did, I, I grew up in a real rough place, all the worst neighborhoods on the Northwest more specifically around Devonport. Yeah I'd lived in a mall and I.\n\nJust like in many of the other households there, there was a lot of conflict and it, low income, it always causes issues, but it's no excuse for what happened. Basically to my mom, myself [00:02:00] and my sister. So my sister Amy, she's what is it? Five, no, six and a half years older than me.\n\nMom meets this guy George. When I'm two and a half, he starts beating her up, right? Just starts beating the shit out of her. And, he starts getting intimidating with us kids. But so after a week or two, I literally stood in front of my mom as a two and a half year old. And I'm not gonna remember this because I've got identical memory, dude.\n\nSo I stood in front of her and I said, leave my mom alone. And so what happened was he's got there and he's punched me in the face and I went up against the wall mate and that was the day I was like, shit, life's real. You know what I mean? And like during that period, I also had to deal with a cousin that sexually assaulted me, right?\n\nAnd both those things played a huge role in me re oppressing who I knew I was like, before those things started, like from about two three, I knew. That I felt [00:03:00] different to the way that I, was perceived by everyone else in society. I thought things like, why can't I wear dresses? Why can't I play with the dolls?\n\nAll that sort of stuff. I'm like, why can't I do these things? And then I realized very quickly if I did do these things that, where I was brought up I would get harassed, bullied, et cetera. And even at that age, I knew not to be honest about that and essentially be like a version of myself.\n\nSo I was authentic, but not in the way that I expressed myself. I was reserved at times, even though I've got both autism and A DHD and I'm very outgoing. There were just a few things where I would just never speak about it. It never popped outta my head. And it was because I had a lot of shame around because it, at the time, this is the the nineties and the like, the two thousands to 2010.\n\nDuring that time, trans people weren't accepted. Even in those years, [00:04:00] gay bashing still happened. Like it was crazy, and it's changed so much in the last 10 to 15 years, like when it comes to acceptance, with the exception of this crazy stuff that's gone on over in the US at the moment, which is having a spillover effect.\n\nTo and proof in the footing there is as and we'll discuss in a minute, I'm currently homeless. I put a post up on Facebook to look for a house, right? And when I went to look for a house I mentioned in the post that myself and, or I should say my partner and I are both trans. So I am transfeminine.\n\nI was born with mostly male charact. Jurisdictions. Although I'm intersex, I've got chromosomes of xb, meaning I don't produce enough testosterone. Something I found out just before I started transitioning. So basically my partner or my fiance, he's was born female and he is transitioning to [00:05:00] male.\n\nAnd so like we just get each other and we've both got autism and a DH. Both dealt with try and we just gel. We just, we just get each other. So anyway, I put this post up because where, wherever we're living, like whether it's a landlord or whether we're in a share house, whoever we're living with or living in their house, they must be able to accept like the situation.\n\nBecause if that isn't the case, it becomes unsafe for us. And I don't worry so much about me because I'm. Very tough. Okay, let's go with that. And I can protect myself, but he is very naive. And if he was to grow up like where I did, I don't know if he would've survived, to be honest. And I just wanna protect him.\n\nEven though typically it's, the masculine role to be the protector, I still see myself that way, and. They, all these people on this post, they just responded. Didn't give a shit about, helping [00:06:00] people that were like escaping DV from ex-partners. They didn't care about that.\n\nAnd all they cared about was the fact that we were trans and. They just gave us the hardest of times and said all these horrible things just because we're trans dude and we're not harming anyone. Like we're two trans people that are together. Like we're not a trans person. That's with someone who's born cisgendered, meaning, they were born, the gender they identify with, and it actually relates back to a Greek term that means the same side as meaning. Okay, so you identify the way that you were born. You know what I mean? Yeah. So like a lot of people get pissed about the term cisgender, but it's no, we're not trying to call you a sissy dude.\n\nIt's. It's actually got a basis in language and there's a history there and what's that you brought it up a second ago. That experience of homelessness for you? Because it's different. Yeah. That's the new thing for me, and the biggest concern that I had to start off with when I realized that I had to [00:07:00] essentially either live in a shelter or jump into a tent, is that if I went into a shelter, then I'm gonna be interacting with personalities.\n\nAnd I know it's gonna be very much my upbringing, right? I'm going into situation where everyone's got their own issues, they've got their mental health and all that sort of stuff. And I'm like, okay, am I gonna get into a situation where they're gonna want to hurt me? Am I gonna have to keep an eye over my shoulder?\n\nAnd. Thankfully I haven't had that. Everyone's been awesome, every, as I said, everyone does have their stuff. They've got their mental health and whatnot, but who wouldn't? We're homeless, dude. That's, that's the honest truth. But no, everyone's generally respectful and everyone has their bad days, but for the most part, we try to help each other out and.\n\nGet through this and whenever someone gets a house, we're happy for 'em. You know what I mean? It's awesome. But I originally started in the safe space in burn. So what happened was I was living in Latrobe for [00:08:00] 13 years. That was with my ex-partner. And I couldn't stay there because even though I had a family violence order against her after she stabbed me with a pair of kitchen scissors because she got violent, I even though like she wasn't allowed to come near me 'cause I got the violence order, what she did is she'd send her stepfather around and he, that, that's where she got the mentality from her stepfather. He would literally go around and rob drug dealers of their drugs. Like he would go and steal pot from the, like he was a nasty man and I had to tolerate him for 18 years of giving me shit, calling me a pussy, doing all this sort of stuff.\n\n'cause even before I come outta Strands. Like I wasn't good enough for his little girl, I wasn't strong enough. I wasn't, because even though no one knew until I told someone that I was gender vessel trans, I still had a more timid nature because I wouldn't do typically alpha male things.\n\nLike I wouldn't give the boys shit. I'd be like, oh, come on, let it go. [00:09:00] You know what I mean? Like I'd play it off like it's not a big deal, but, I wouldn't be a jerk about it and try and join in. There was like a lot of roughhousing in the neighborhoods as kids and like I wouldn't join in on that and I'd probably say, leave him alone.\n\nBut I do feel a bit guilty for not stepping in and saying something a bit more sometimes. And that's. It also directly relates to, the coming out and being comfortable with it, especially in a place like this. I'm like, okay, here we go. Let's go in. But the fact that I'm autistic is such a key asset when it comes to that.\n\nBecause a big thing with being autistic is narrative, right? So if you're in a situation that you've not dealt with before, what tends to happen is you tend to go through it in your head before you have to deal with it as best you can. And then when you get there just like a story on a screen, it plays out a bit like a script.\n\nYeah. And so like I'm going through all the [00:10:00] 10,000 scenarios in my head because I'm an A DHD as well. You add those two together and you got someone who's very specific, logical, and thinks a midling miles a second, right? And so everything's just gone. All the scenarios are gone through my head and I'm like calculating it all.\n\nAnd I'm like, okay, cool. All right. I know what we're gonna do when we're going here. We're gonna. We're going in as the doctor which doing a medical degree by the way. Yeah. Hoping to become a trans doctor. Cool. Someone who helps other people in my situation. 'cause there's not enough in Tasie. Yeah.\n\nThere just isn't. And sorry bud. You go. You sweet. Yeah. What do you think about this iron inspire thing? Is this Oh me. I couldn't believe it. I get here and I'm like, people do my washing for me. I was the total like, housewife type person even before I transitioned 'cause stayed at home as a carer for my son sort of thing.\n\nAnd so like I was always doing the house. I got here and I'm like, oh my God, someone's gonna do my washing for me. And it's such an invaluable service. 'cause you don't think of the little things that [00:11:00] you're gonna struggle with if you're homeless, at washing. And so at the moment, you, I'm okay. I need to make sure that I've got the outfits, the week sort of thing. I need to make sure I get here on, this day sort of thing or go there that day. You have to think of those things and that's why it's hard for say a homeless person to hold down a job and that sort of thing because they have to go to all these different places just to get, the essential, things they need that basic human rights I would call. Yeah.\n\nAnd what, how did you first hear it? Did you just stumble across this and what did you sorry, I actually found out about it here. But they said, oh yeah, there's someone that comes around to your washing. And they explained it to me, but then. I didn't realize, I thought they come around, picked it up, went away.\n\nI didn't realize there was, the van and the the dryers and everything. And I like when they hooked a lot, I'm like, oh, this is awesome. This makes so much more sense. Coming up with a creative solution like that for something just so [00:12:00] essential and having it, portable so they can go to different spots because, again, homeless probably not gonna have transport.\n\nSo being able to move and do this is the way to go. Yeah, for sure. And what about this idea of part of it's watching and part of it's conversation, having a yarn with volunteers and Oh yeah. I'm all on board with that. Like everyone's great. And even just being able to go and say, Hey, look.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had, I've got this awesome pair of rainbow shoes, dude. They're massive. Everyone's oh yeah. I'm like, yeah, if anyone gives me a hard time, I'm gonna put the rainbow up their house. But anyway I'd wore 'em without socks, which I tend to do 'cause I always lose my socks, right?\n\nNo reason. And so anyway I come out and ask 'em if they can wash 'em for me, and I had to wash 'em a few times to get like the, the dirty or smelly feet smell. Out of them. And I'm like, it's awesome. They just wanted the effort to do that. They're not getting paid by me. Obviously it's funding from somewhere.\n\nBut it was just awesome that, and I love it because I used to run a computer [00:13:00] business that was low cost for pensioners and putting in the effort even though the big bucks aren't there. That's awesome. That's just so awesome. What do you, what's your sort of concept of. Impact of this service.\n\nThese, they're all around the country. They do washing. It's a little bit of, yeah. Just quick question. Do they do any other services? I wasn't, I'm not sure. I know they do the washings showers. Showers and then which they start again. Is there one here for showers or I don't think so.\n\nOnly reason I was asking is because, i'm normally onto it down at the safe space night facility, but I missed it this morning. I got there and I'm looking at 10 past seven. I was meant to be in at seven and I'm like, oh no. Sharon Mother's Day. That's brutal. It's already a terrible day for all of us.\n\nSo no if showers washers and then they flex after going into remote communities and having, okay. Yeah, no, that's awesome. I've got indigenous heritage, so it's cool to hear that. 'cause like especially out on some of the the like in the nt [00:14:00] Yeah. Some of the more rural places, they're essentially Yeah.\n\nThey need that sort of stuff. 'cause they might not have Yeah. Good running water. They might have running water, but it might not, and do you think the impact is more around the washing or. People talk about that idea of connection and conversation. Yeah. Yeah. It's awesome having someone have a chat.\n\nJust before we started there, I was over there having a chat with one of the ladies and just, as I do start talking and don't stop told her in my story and then obviously you've come over and to have a chat and that yeah. Yeah. No, it's awesome to be able to do that because.\n\nEspecially at the moment, bud, like I had to leave the northwest for my safety. So I don't, I, I know a few people down here. I've got a few friends. But yeah, you need to be able to have those charts, especially when you're going through a time that's probably not the greatest in your life. Yeah. 'cause no one, obviously wants to be homeless.\n\nI don't believe. You've got the odd ones who struggle to, to get out of it. And I'm really hoping that I don't have an issue obtaining housing. I [00:15:00] know that I'm gonna be motivated to do i'm only I've probably been living rough for about a month. Essentially what happened was I had to leave Latrobe for my safety.\n\nI couldn't stay with my current partner because he lives in like an independent living. Thing where they've got like onsite support and they've got a thing in the lease where you can't have a second person reside. And they were issuing like him with an eviction notice and all this, and I'm like, I can't make someone else homeless.\n\nSo I'm like, no, rather than do that, let me go do something more productive. Let me go to the safe space in Hobart and find us a house, where it's safe and away from the problem. So yeah, that's how I ended up here. That's cool. I could talk all day. I know buddy. I know. And hey mate, I can talk to you under there.\n\nTalk. I've gotta talk with one of them. Yeah, sure. People as well. Yeah. I'll just take a quick photo. Yeah, of course bud. Just stay right there for me.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Ray Kirkman\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSound's on my camera's recording. Gotta clap my hands. That's a good clap. All right, Ray, all you need to do first is tell me your full name and spell it for me. Raymond? You want all be Christian names? Just your first and last. Alright. Raymond Kirkman. K-I-R-K-M-A-N. Awesome. Tell me what's the Ray story?\n\nTell me a little bit about Ray to begin with yourself. We've only been here in Toowoomba for six years. I originally come from the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. We left there in 1990. I sold three businesses and a very big home, which we had turned into ready to open as a, b and b. And I decided it was time to [00:01:00] make big changes in our life.\n\nI had left a government job for fif I had for 15 years, which had a lot of stress involved.\n\nIf I tell you where it was, you'd understand why I worked for corrective services for 15 years. I was a very senior officer. When I resigned basically because I couldn't support junior staff after the Royal Commission in the New South Wales prisons and in staff training, I was telling people, when this job affects you, you should get out.\n\nAnd I went to work one morning and acting a second in charge and started the staff. And then reported that there was a resignation and that it was me, and they tried to talk me out of it, and I said, I'm walking out that front door. I'm not turning around and I'm not coming back. I got home a bit after nine in the morning and my wife said, you're sick.\n\nI said, [00:02:00] no, I've just resigned. She said that's nice. What are we going to do? I said we've been collecting antiques for years. I'm gonna open an antique shop. And that's what we did. We ended up opening two of them. But then in my way of looking at different businesses, I see an opportunity and one was with a rundown carrying business, which I bought, and we took that through the roof.\n\nAnd three years we sold. In the meantime, I had had a couple of parties and I had hired a spit roast machine. I ended up building three of them and went into the catering business and we fed quite a lot of people on average of around 900 a week. And we done a lot of weddings, sometimes two weddings on the one day.\n\nAnd come 1990. [00:03:00] We decided that it was time to change. I was 46 I virtually retired and we sold up everything and I fitted out a 40 foot single decker bus for the trailer and a four wheel drive, and we set off, we went, came to Brisbane. And what was always the plan that we would buy a property, which we did up in Grange only about five Ks outta the city, which we own for the next 30 years, and we spent quite a few years still traveling.\n\nAlong with a couple of overseas trips, and the last one was for four months plus a month in London on the way home. We spent quite a lot of money. My working account said, work is what you need to be doing. My wife got, she's a nurse. She'd got a district job here in Toowoomba, centered [00:04:00] in Chinchilla.\n\nIt was the center of all her district, and there wasn't anything there for me. And I spotted a. An old house, an old Queensland, they on an acre and a half on the highway, got B and B again. So we bought that and commence, started renovating, double the size of it, and in the meantime I started doing a bit of catering and which got outta hand.\n\nWe ended up being the major caterer in the town as well as the BB, but leading up to then to 2006. My knees had it, I had to have a double knee replacement. So we had that and then we sold up. I'd imported a seven meter wide body fuse over bus outta Japan. Stripped that out and fitted it out.\n\nCome February in the next year we set off round Australia for the next 12 years.\n\nWe then decided [00:05:00] that we would. Sell Brisbane and another house that we owned over there and chinchilla and that we would after the 12 years on the road, we came to here and we decided to settle here in Toowoomba because it had everything that we were ever going to need. I didn't have any medical problems.\n\nThat changed after 14 months. I had a stroke and 18 months later I was diagnosed with Parkinson's. On top of that, my life turned around and my mobility became\n\na little bit harder. I had lost the peripheral vision, so I couldn't drive anymore, and I. That then started in the covid, which closed everything down and all [00:06:00] our further plans, everything changed from that day, those days on. And then when things started to move again, because of being on the road you have different lots of friends you meet every day.\n\nAnd back in the Hunter that was the same because we were so well known. So you had a lot of friends around you. I belonged to various organizations and when we came here, I still belonged to those organizations, but I was finding that there was something missing in my life and I couldn't work out what it was.\n\nI had a friend who was coming to Tom Net. And he talked to me about it and I said, no, I don't really think that's gonna be for me. I said, I'm still tied up with my other two organizations. And then I started to think about it because the two that I belong still belong to. Very structured [00:07:00] organizations.\n\nThey're there for a particular reason. They do one particular job. The other one that is another organization has one particular outlook on what you do, and I was missing something and then I decided that we'd come along to Tom net one day. I found when I did that, that I found out what was missing and it's that I.\n\nEvery day sitting down, having a yarn amongst men. A lot of people might do that in their earlier days in a pub or something, I don't know. But for me, it was those conversations that I used to have outside those organisations and I wasn't getting it until I came to TOMNET and TOMNET has helped me in such a lot.\n\nTo be able to come along. [00:08:00] It's very relaxed. There's no better than me or anything else. It's just the conversations can start. There might be everybody in the room in the one conversation, or it might be. Somebody is talking about something, but somebody else sitting there brings up something and say you've turned and you've sat and you started talking one-on-one with somebody, or it's a smaller group, or it's a big group.\n\nThere's no organisation about how that is going to work. It's what happens on the day. And a lot of it is about some of the things we've done in our lives. What vehicle you might have owned. All sorts of things come in. People, what jobs they've done and, I was very reluctant to talk about some of my background, but that raised a lot of interest [00:09:00] amongst a few people, particularly when conversation came up one day about the problem with our youth in the area.\n\nAnd I have had a lot to do in that field, in correctional services and said.\n\nMy life has been down many tracks and as far as business goes and that, but it's this being able to sit and have a talk and not to have to worry that you don't have to talk. You can sit and listen for all you like, or you can join in the conversation. Somebody says something and then you make a comment and you become part of that other group that's talking.\n\nAnd a lot of the time at Tuesday afternoon, groups a little bit smaller and [00:10:00] so the conversations can we, we have a lot of laughter, we have a lot of jokes amongst you because we've got one bloke that'll sit and go to sleep, but that's good. Because that's what he's getting. He's getting out of it.\n\nYeah. He is there and he enjoys it. I have find that it's for me is something that is very important for my mind and relating to other people away from my structured life. And they're very structured but they're things that I'm very involved in and I have been involved in for a long time.\n\nCan I ask where you're from? The Hunter Valley from Maitland East Maitland. Amazing. I'm from Musel Brook. Yeah. We're actually going back there on next Monday. We head off. Oh, cool. My wife and I. [00:11:00] Well, for about 30 years, Kay's mom and dad started a family day on Anzac Day, where we all lived all over the place, but we'd go to a dawn service and then we'd turn up in the particular area and we'd have a barbecue and an afternoon together.\n\nSo people travel from Queensland down for the day. The day before Anzac Day is my wife, Kay, and our wedding anniversary. Wow. This year we're celebrating down there 60 years of marriage. So on the Saturday night, that's the day before Anzac Day. So Anzac Day, we'll have all our grandchildren, everything will be there.\n\nBut the Saturday night is just for our four. Yeah. And their husbands are wives. 'cause we've got three daughters and one, one son, and my wife's three sisters and their husbands. And [00:12:00] I'm taking them all out for dinner on the Saturday night to celebrate. Wow. Our good friends getting married on the 24th of April in Lennox Head next week.\n\nThere you go. 24th of April was a good day. And then my birthday is Anzac Day ah, a lot of celebration coming up. Yeah. What's you've done a great job here. You've answered all my questions without me asking any, so you've done a very good job. What what do you think is, I've got so many questions for young people.\n\nTo have elders listen to them and connect with them, what I think it's very important. It in when we travel, and this was a bit, we, there is a lot of families who are traveling with children on the road and we bush cramp camp most of the time we're set up, so we're all solar powered and everything else.\n\nWe don't need anything. We do still go to parks. When you go into cities or in the [00:13:00] bigger towns, you go and you stay in a park, but the biggest percent of your time you're out. And in that case, I always use the analogy that when you're sitting on a log around the fire, you're sitting on a log around the fire.\n\nDoesn't matter what you're driving and what you've got or anything else, it's no good. Everybody's on the one level around the, I found that a lot of children and young teenagers were so good in conversation with people on all sorts of things that they had seen. Yeah, we traveled a lot with our children when they were young and we were young as well, and all school holidays we went away and we went bush camping and that in tents and in lean twos or whatever.\n\nWe traveled a lot and my children and my grandchildren all still travel today and what you get outta that, [00:14:00] I suppose is. In some ways, a bit like Mnet is that you are in a broader conversation, but the importance of those children are so far advanced, being able to sit and talk to people in a discussion, they understand and they know about various areas around the country.\n\nThey've seen problems around the country. They're being schooled, but they, I should tell you, they are so far in front of what they learn and what they know and how wise they are for their age. And I think that's a big thing as far as that goes. Tom net, yes. I am, when I first came to Tom Net, I thought I would like to have worked with [00:15:00] young people who were having problems, but my mobility, the fact that I've gotta have someone drive me I do.\n\nI've only just started on a care package and. I've got a taxi card that I can use. But for me to be able to get around and do that it's a little bit hard. Plus my medication is gotta be right on time, all the time for the Parkinson's. So it's every four hours. And then I've got others, I've got four specialists that I've gotta visit.\n\nPlus my local gp. So it life becomes a little bit of a mixture there and probably the reason why Tom met means so much to me. But it is also something than I know that they do here with these young people. That is very [00:16:00] good. And I have talked to them to some of the people that do that because it's a really worthwhile part of Tom.\n\nIt's part of life for, it's what a lot of young people need is more interaction. If you can get them away from here for a while and put 'em over somewhere where you've got no distractions, it's quite, you see the change in people? We ran programs in, in corrective services in New South Wales years ago, now going back to the sixties and and seventies.\n\nAnd we had programs for young people and for, 'cause there's a grading in institutions. Yeah. Everyone talks about the numbers and numbers mean something. Low numbers are much, much higher. Crime rates and then what we always termed [00:17:00] as our, the boys as the 18 to 24 year olds where they're not. In with the other groups in that, that if you try to keep them and be able to get them, education has always been available in those, anyone going in and you can do university degrees.\n\nWe've had 'em do law degrees. There is no, nothing that stops. When Cessnock first opened, I was there for the, to help in the opening. And I was in charge of all prison industries. We had our cabinet shop and the metal workshop that had what still today would be classed as top equipment, top learning aids for young people where you could teach them how to come to work, how to work for the day, how to think about what you were doing, and how to get [00:18:00] satisfaction out of achieving something.\n\nIt was always the big thing and outta scrap. I used to get them to make toys and stuff, which would give away to various charities, and I always felt that had a big meaning to them to be able to make something that they wanted to make and then to give it away. Any other last reflections on Tom that as a thing or.\n\nSomething we didn't talk about. You think? What's any last sort of thoughts or,\n\nas I say, I think Tom Knit was, for me, is so important because it gives me that opportunity. To relax. It gives, see, my [00:19:00] wife is my carer. Now your wife is one thing, your carer is another. Too many people think that their wife is just their carer. It's not. She has to give up things for me, so I try to make sure that she goes with friends and has coffee.\n\nBut when I come here and she drops off, she goes to the shops. Her. And I just say to her, just draw out money. You might see a dress go. You don't, you've never had to ask her. Why start thinking about it Now you've got to keep that side of your life up. Because you're giving up so much more for me to drive me here.\n\nOne of the things I'm involved with, of course, is my church and I am a lay preacher. She, my wife, still drives me to Gunda Windy on the first Sunday of every month to take a service out there and then drives me back home here. It's a big day, [00:20:00] but that's a part of my life. But that's a structured part, and I belong to the Masonic Lodge and have been for 50 years.\n\nAgain, it's so structured. Nothing wrong with them, but they're just structured. You have to have things that are a little bit different, that have a joke, that have a laugh, that are not straight up and down most of the time. And and that's what I find here. We come, people here are from all works of life.\n\nWe've got Queens councils, we've got barristers, we've had lawyers. You've had, you've got accountants, you've got people from all, you've got Farmers Train driver. Now we're not one mold, we're a whole group of complete [00:21:00] individual people. And that's the beauty, that's the beauty of it. That you can, somebody can start talking about their job on the railway.\n\nAnd we can all be part of it. We're all part of the story and.\n\nI'm probably lucky in lots of ways 'cause I had such a wide variety in my life in what I've done. I left school when I was 14 and 10 months old. I had to leave because I had have a physical fight with a teacher because he'd backhanded the young fella. But. I got a job in a furniture factory and I was putting the lights on for the bedsides and things like that, but when I'd finished all the work that I had, I used to go over to the bench and I'd start working there.\n\nI'd pick up a planner or I'd start sanding, and then [00:22:00] they offered me an apprenticeship, which I took. Cool. And then every 12 months I changed my apprenticeship. I went to from that. To a joinery shop, and I left the joinery shop after 12 months of my next year and went on to cottages, and then I went on to major construction the day I finished my apprenticeship on the Friday.\n\nOn the Monday, myself and four others went out into an open paddock in Newcastle to start pecking out for stage one of the Newcastle University. Wow, that's cool. And then I went and started my own construction company. Until we got caught with in a big way on a final payment where the money was withdrawn and put in the ve at that [00:23:00] time, they could get away with putting it in the vehicles and caravans in their wives names, and we missed out badly.\n\nAnd that's why I went to corrective service. That's wild. That's funny. Yeah.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I got set free brother, I tell you what, it's a good feeling mate. Now God wings it for us. Oh yeah, we rely on God a bit mate. Cool, so what you can do with these, it's kind of fun, is like, it sort of does this. That's better, I'll set it to the gil. Oh yeah, see it's easy when you know how, ain't it mate? I was gonna say, I felt a little bit of a little fluffy, fluffy thing in your face, that's good mate. Yeah, and the sound actually works really well in your sternum. And it looks like, yeah it looks like a special little reward or something mate. A little DJI of that. Oh wait, that's it. Cool, well I think the best thing to do is you go say your full name and spell it for me, just so I've got that. Yeah, Kevin Voss, V-O-S, K-E-V-I-N is Kevin and Voss is V-O-S. And Veronica Voss, V-E-R-O-N-I-C-A and Voss, V-O-S. Who wants to kick us off with a little bit about you both I guess? Go for it sister. Okay. So literally, we met when we were 15 and in an institution, in a welfare institution. And we got pretty badly tortured in that institution in Western Australia here. And we got pretty badly tortured in that institution in Western Australia here. And then we didn't see each other for 40 years. So we both like did a Moses journey, you know we call it. And I went to live on the east coast and Kevin stayed here in Western Australia. And then I came back in 2020 and Kevin was still alive, thank goodness. Because I didn't know whether he'd be alive or dead. Just alive. A few people didn't make it that were in the institution with us. So then God started us on a journey of, we already knew God, but God started us on a journey of travelling and he said take Jesus to the streets. So we've survived a lot of things, suffered from a lot of depression and PTSD. And now we're walking the streets with Jesus. We're doing chaplaincy. Praise God. We've been in Kalgoorlie for a couple of months after our African trip, doing missionary work. And now we're at M25. It's like the hub of the community where all agencies come together. And there's God in it as well, you know. That's really important to us that it's holistic. So it's body, soul and spirit, you know. People need food for their body. They also need spiritual food. And they get services like washing and showering and clothes and the food and whatever services they need. They're here and we love that. We love that about this. Can you paint a picture of where we are I guess? What is this place we're at and what's happening at the moment I guess? Well we're 600 kilometres roughly thereabouts from Perth East in the gold fields. It's a big mining hub. There's a big pit over there. It's one of the biggest pits in the world. Gold pits. And I think they've been pulling gold out of there probably for nearly 100 years. Yeah, there's 14 different tribes. In the gold fields. Yeah, there's 14 tribes in the gold fields area. Actually is it 14 tribes? This hub too. Yeah, this hub. Around this hub, yeah. Yeah, so around this hub. And yeah, it's a very community based area. And yeah, what we've found since we've been here is that the churches have been pulling together. And it's really becoming a really good community spirit. And yeah, this place here. Which is attached to the church there behind us. Church of Christ. Have put this centre together. And now there's all churches getting involved in it. And well we just feel the peace and the love in this place. It's a place for people to come and rest. Especially the people out there that live on the fringes of the town. And we're just so gracious. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we're just so grateful to God that he's pointed us in the right direction to come here. And to be able to serve. So it's a really good community feeling here. And all different people sort of like come here. It becomes just one blood, one place for everybody just to enjoy each other's company. Share testimony. And also to realise that God will meet you where you're at, no matter where you're at. And that God will meet you there. And the good thing is a lot about this place as well is there's no judgement here. No condemnation. And that's the beautiful thing I like. I myself and my wife, we lived on the streets in our time before. And we always felt like that we got judged. There was judgement there. So anyway, that's a bit about this place. And yeah, we're just so glad to be part of it. And so gracious that God opened doors and brought us here. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think central to that is, this is the first place, we've travelled around a bit, went to Geraldton first, came here, that this is the first place we've seen like a really concerted effort, a concerted unity, like between churches and agencies, like in town. And we're just doing a chaplaincy course at the moment that they started up in Kalgoorlie, which we graduate in at the end of October. But... It's compartmental with this and being out on the streets. We're seeing people out on the streets that we're meeting here. So there's a real united front. And, man, every, like, all these facilities in this block alone that people can come in and have every, you know, literally, besides a house, everything that they need, without a donation tin at the gate is, like, so powerful. Every place, every regional area should have something like this because this homelessness and everything that's happening here is happening, we've seen it in other regional areas, that there's no reason why this can't happen in other places. Tell us a little bit about this thing behind us here and were you here when it came and what's been the impact of it? I think this has been, the whole centre, this centre's been going for about two years. I'm not sure how long the washing machine, cyclist has been here, but I think that all, like, came together. So there's three washing machines and three industrial drawers and Phillip doesn't stop. There's, people have their own bags, their names on them, they put their washing in and it gets dried. They can shower while all that's happening, have breakfast and then come back. I actually saw it in North Queensland as well during cyclone seasons. So to have it here, we're... to have it here, they've got a washing machine where they are, or a dryer or... yeah, it's fantastic, it's really fantastic. Because they have a change of clothes that they can pick up, so they get their, have a shower, they get their clothes washed and dried and they can pick up their clothes from before that they've got stored in a storeroom inside there, so that they've got the clothes that they take off, they can get washed on the day and then they've got a change of clothes there that they can get into. So they've always got a spare set of clothes in there and that must do it. be a really good security and just knowing that they can have a clean set of clothes when they come in here for them that must be a nice thing for them because being out there in the elements obviously doesn't really make you feel spiritually good I suppose. And they can walk away here being fed, warm belly, filled belly and have a nice change of clothes and be showered. But it's like one of those basic forms of dignity isn't it? Yeah, well that's right. To be clean and have clean clothes. If you've got that all the time you take it for granted but for someone who hasn't got any of it to come here and be able to be clean, have clean clothes, change the clothes, it's powerful as a human being to have dignity in that. It's huge isn't it? Yeah, I've been in the street there and had a fractured soul and all the rest that goes on with it. And then when you're filthy as well it's really hard to believe that you can actually get yourself out of that pit. So just to be tidy and spiritually filled up with love and care. Makes you feel filthy on the inside doesn't it? Well of course it does, yeah. So definitely they can feel like they're living again and that somebody cares for them when they walk away from here. That's for sure. One last question. So Orange Sky started by two young fellas just with an idea to wash clothes but it turned into this idea. So if you think about the relationship and connection part really like here around friendship and connection. Yeah. When you think about those words of friendship and connection what comes to mind in terms of what's happening here I guess ? Friendship and connection, well again with friendship and connection it feels like actually feel that you're human and that you're wanted. That somebody cares and that you do matter. Because I like it. You know, with obviously being homeless and all out in the elements, there's always a reason behind that. And with that goes like emptiness, not feeling like that you're really worthy. And, you know, when you can come to a place like this and feel like that there's a community and you just don't have to look too far to see the community, one blood and, you know, don't worry about what colour skin we are. God, let us all equal, you know, and for people to be able to rest, a bit of basketball, clean clothes, have a shower, have a feed and just connect with each other. And you know what, without any, it's unconditional, unconditional love and friendship. And I think that that really matters because I know what it feels like to just feel lost in life and not really feel like that you're connected to anybody. So it's a power. It's a powerful thing for people just to be able to feel like that they matter and that somebody does care. And, you know, God's always there for you. But, you know, to come and have that interaction with people, it's a really good situation for yourself as far as when you walk away that you can just take with you that somebody does care and get on with the rest of your day type thing. So I think it's a powerful thing to have friendship and connection, unconditional with no judgment, you know, especially. So that's my point of view. So when we think of community, community is like communicate, you know, just basic communication between people. You know, kids can come here and play. Mums and dads communicating with each other and building friendships here. When people come in here, there's no you're that tribe or you're that tribe. I know that there's some things that go on in the community with that. But in here, it's a safe environment where people can just come together. And we we take those who have washing machines to take it for granted, you know, that we've got to throw the washing on today, throw the washing on tomorrow. But really in the community, what does that say if you can't share it with someone else? So everybody comes here as a community communicating and friendships. Here is basic kindness, isn't it? Basic kindness to just show someone that they're good. Yeah. Because when you're on the street, like full time and a long time, we find when we go on the street and even here, when's the last time you had a hug? When's the last time someone shook your hand and said, how are you today? You know, we're talking about washing machines, but the whole lot goes together. Dignity, friendship, community, relationship and basic humanitarian kindness and friendship. Yeah. That's it. It all goes together. You can't really have one without the other. And God's for us. I don't know if you're Christian or not, but for us, God is in it all. Because we as especially as teenagers, we felt invisible. We didn't have someone coming past us going, what do you need today? Simple as that. What do you need today? What can we do today or even sit there and listen to you? So we really get the environment here. We don't know all the people, but we get the environment. We're good. We're good. You know, we're going to sit down, we're going to do this, we're going to be in a place where you can sit and talk and need something, you know? It's gold for me, brother. It's gold. I tell you what, just a handshake, a smile, a nod of the head, eye contact, a hug. Spiritual connection, brother, whatever it takes, mate. Like God will just use us for whatever he wants. It's like the congenuity, you know, to be in the vessel just to smile, acknowledge, acknowledgement. It can be everything. Someone can have a terrible day, mate, you don't know what they're going to be doing or what they're planning on doing. what they plan on doing, but a smile, a handshake, a hug, can change their whole pattern on that day, mate. People forget that they're human. They don't know that. If your heart's not working, you're just running on empty and there's nothing, then yep, you're searching out what can I eat, where can I sleep under a cover, but that's not being human. Human is being in community, in communication, and a holistic approach. So that people don't feel like they're invisible. Yeah, I think it's a bit contagious sometimes too when you do have a bit of a connection with whoever it may be and then you've got that smile and a little bit of pick me up where you feel like, wow, that made me feel good. When they go out of here, I think that at least some of those people will take that out with them as well into the community. And maybe their day wasn't looking so bright when they came here, but they've left with a bit of a different attitude about someone just unkind to them. They're not as well-conditionally said hello, smiled or whatever, hugged, and they go back out and then their day can be changed from that. So seeds, take the seeds out there and spread them around and maybe they'll get watered. So yeah, we're just so grateful that God sent us in this direction and so grateful for this place and to see all these beautiful people here sitting out in the sun and everybody's resting. It doesn't solve every problem, but I'm telling you. It's a good feeling. Communication and friendship in this place resolves something. It's an issue of the heart. And you've got to start with that. Yeah. There's definitely movement in the camp, Ben, that's for sure, brother. I tell you what, mate. We've only been here, what, four weeks? Well, been in Kalgoorlie two months, but here three or four weeks. Yeah, this is our fourth time, I think. But we can just see that God's got something moving here. And we're glad that we'll be part of it. And it's like a big puzzle around Kalgoorlie. There's just a lot of people doing things in the background. Even with this interview with yourself, it's a lot of people. And it's just bringing the puzzle together. And we believe there's going to be some powerful stuff happening in Kalgoorlie spiritually. And hopefully what you do here, when you take it out there, it'll go to other places. Yeah. There's money in every community to do this. There's money in every community to do this. And, yeah, hopefully it'll catch. Not just like the washing machines are central to people being clean and having clean clothes and being a part of humanity, that they mean something, that they matter, that so many regional areas, and not just here, Queensland, it doesn't matter where you go, there's a regional area that needs this. Washing machines and dryers are a part of it. If you feel clean on the outside, it doesn't solve all your problems, but I'm telling you now, it cleans something up on the inside. Definitely. Very good. I'm just going to take a couple more pickies. Well done, though. Happy with that, brother? That was amazing.\n",

      "Transcript": "\"text\": \" You're just going to say your name and spell it for me? That's it? Jess, J-E-S-S. And lastly? Smit, S-M-I-T. Cool. Tell me a little bit about yourself. How would you introduce yourself? My name's Jess and I have been in Townsville for the last 18 years. My background is teaching, I'm an educator. But in the last couple of years I've fallen into the ATSIMS program as the project officer so I work with a number of high school students and engage in marine science First Nations kids which is my area of passion and support and we bring them out to the reef and get them to see new experiences. Is this what I'm talking about? Tell us what's going on today. So today we came out to Great Palm Island and we've come out with a few different groups. We've got the Orpheus Island Station Crew. We've got a few of us ATSIMS ambassadors and staff members and our alumni. And then we've also got the Minga Minga Ranger Group and the Mumba Traditional Owners. And we've come out to a special site, a sacred site, and we're here to capture some footage and just to explore this area as well, following up with a traditional story and yeah just working together in collaboration. How does it feel to be part of this story like from what you do from a research perspective to what happens on the island like what's that sort of feel like to you? Yeah, this is really special for me. I grew, my career started here on Palm Island. So I began teaching straight out of uni here. So I've known some of these people in the team for quite a number of years and to circle back here in a different space has been absolutely incredible. And I've just been really honoured to be here and brought out to this site today and share that experience with the ladies as well, in particular. Seeing the young people come through as our ambassador as well, our alumni, and I guess sharing that with other people. And there's this thematic that everyone's been talking about which is women in water. What sort of emotions or interests does that stir up in you in terms of like what that means? Is it thematic for today, for the future? I suppose for me it's about capacity building and empowering others and that's really close to my heart. And I see that happening today, that sense of shared purpose and freedom. Being out in the water, there's nothing like it. And then being able to just explore that together as well. So yeah. That's cool. And what's next maybe for you and for the project do you think? Look there's opportunities on the horizon anyway I look. My time's not done here on Palm so I see myself coming back in a different capacity each couple of years sort of like a boomerang you can't get rid of me so I I would love to see something grow and form here for the young people. So from the school kids that I'm working with and teaching on the island right through to graduates and into the workforce because that's where our next leaders are. Good way to finish. Is that alright? Anything else that you wanted to say? That was amazing. Well done. Was that alright? Did you do that a lot? What? I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things.\",\n",

Three, two. Oh, we should say the same about the van. Oh yeah. Oh really? Let's, who runs outta battery first? Yeah. Alright, cool. Ready to go. Um, name and spell. It'll be awesome. My name's Beck Smy, B-E-C-S-M-Y-T-H. Cool. Uh, Kita Zim. K-E-E-D-A-Z-I-L-M. Keda, why don't you go first and tell me a tiny bit about yourself first?<�/p> <�p>About myself? Yeah. Uh, about myself. Um, I, I'm a wine maker based in the Bara. I live here in Adelaide. Um, I grew up down in Kingston, in the southeast. And I dunno what to tell you about myself. That's really interesting. Actually. I, um, <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Great. Yeah. Good start. Yeah. Um, back and, um, I was born in England, grew up in Adelaide, but then I've lived in Darwin and Canberra and Sydney and Hong Kong and Darwin again and back to Adelaide and.<�/p> <�p>I used to be a teacher, but I've retired. It's fantastic. That's my, I know. It's so good. How did you first hear about, uh, through an organization that I did some other volunteer work for, and to be honest, I didn't know that this site existed. I drive down Port Road regularly and didn't even know what, what was here, and went on the website and applied and found this.<�/p> <�p>Many, many opportunities to, to volunteer. So, um, and I just thought it was such a wonderful pause. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> Um, has it changed over time, I suppose, your thoughts about Orange Skype? Thoughts about your thoughts about why you're doing this or similar? Yeah, it's had a huge, a huge impact on my perspective of, number one, how grateful I truly am for, for my personal situation and I guess.<�/p> <�p>How to share basic dignities with people. Um, it doesn't take a lot. It's just time. It's just my time. There's nothing else I need to give up to, to do this. And you meet so many wonderful people, not only the, the volunteers. We've got such a great friendship base, um, but you know, the friends of Orange Sky that, that we get to spend time with.<�/p> <�p>So it's, it's really, it's really special actually. Yeah. So, um, I'd love for you to tell me like. What it's like or what this place is like in relation to the people who work as support and service providers and stuff. Like Walk, walk us through where we are and, and what, what this is <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> like. So do you mean these just, just this whole place and the whole, yeah.<�/p> <�p>Okay. It's not quite and peaceful 'cause it's right in the middle of Port Road in literally in the middle of the road. But it's, it's always a. It's always a pleasant place to be. Like you come and there's always a bunch of people hanging around, having some food, having a chat. There's always a cue for the laundry, which is really good.<�/p> <�p>'cause you, you know, you want, that's why we're here. We, we want to do people's laundry. Um, it's a really interesting mix of people. So you get some regulars that you see day in and day out, and then you get. People that, you know, some people who come for a while and then they vanish. Um, it's interesting sometimes when you know, somebody hasn't been for a while who used to always come and everyone's like, oh, are they okay?<�/p> <�p><�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> What's going on? And then you just get people that were just passing through. So you eat. So it's, it's always a pleasant place to be. Like, every time I walk home, I walk home with a smile on my face going, oh yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that's cool. And the people working in the, in the food hub are amazing.<�/p> <�p>Absolutely amazing. Those two in particular, the, the, they're just phenomenal. Yeah. It's a little family unit and, um, I have a sit. What's it like sort of relating to people like Julie and, um, is there a way you approach that in terms of when they first turn up? Or like, how does that feel, I guess, to be able to engage with someone?<�/p> <�p>Uh, I think you, you realize that it's more, more than just having your washing done week to week, which is such a simple thing for you and I to do. In fact, it's a chore <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:05:00]<�/span> that you just loathe and you forget to do it, you know, whatever it may be, but. That they, you know, people come for the company and the genuine connection and that feels that, that's just a lovely, another lovely aspect of of this, I think.<�/p> <�p>And like when Julie first came, she was very quiet and very timid. And now she's completely comfortable and she's joking with people and. You know, it's a, it's a regular thing. Yeah. It's nice just getting people to slowly open up an\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Kirrily\n\n[00:00:00] Clap my hands awkwardly. Alright, I think we're rocking. I'm just going to, we're good. Look at me. So you don't have to look at any of this. This is okay, right? I'm just, I'm here as a person. This is, here is nothing. Cool. So you have to do is say your full name and spell it. My name is Ki Lee Bryan Scarf.\n\nK-I-R-R-I-L-Y-B-R-I-A-N-N-E, scarf, S-C-A-R-F. Cool. How do you like to introduce yourself in terms of, do you talk about your identity, where you're from, who you are? I'm happy you can go, you can take your own journey as to introduce yourself. I just introduced myself by using my name. Okay. So two students would be Mrs.\n\nScarf two adults. It would be Ki Lee. Yeah. Cool. And what's a little bit about yourself to start us off? I'm nearly 54 years old, married with two kids. I've got a 27-year-old daughter, [00:01:00] 19-year-old son. Grew up out west out near St. George. And then been in Toowoomba for most of my life.\n\nI'm a Chinese language teacher, so I've spent a fair bit of time in China. Yeah, and I get to practice my Chinese on a daily basis as we support a lot of students from so many different cultural backgrounds. But we do have a lot of Chinese students at the school, so I really love practicing my Chinese.\n\nI. Cool. What types of roles do you cover at the school, not just in teaching and other things? Yeah I'm a Chinese language teacher and an English teacher. For my entire career I've also worked with EALD students, which is, stands for English as an additional language or dialect. I started doing that at uni.\n\nI was tutoring Chinese students, English. So at this school currently I'm the EALD coordinator. Which means I manage the support provisions for our ELD students. So we've got 1800 students at the school. About 25% of them identify as EALD, as having English as an additional language or dialect.[00:02:00] \n\nAnd this school is actually across the darling downs, the most culturally and linguistically diverse school. So we have about 60 different cultural backgrounds here. That's awesome. Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah. What role do volunteers play in the school? Yep. So in within the ELD program that I manage our volunteers come in and they support our, mainly our newly arrived refugee and migrant children.\n\nAnd we have developed a an ELD Learn to Read program. So they work in that space where they're doing one-on-one reading. With our ELD students and through that reading they're not only developing the students' literacy levels, but they're also helping develop their confidence as they engage in, developing their conversational skills.\n\nAnd through the volunteers, the young people are also able to ask questions in a really safe environment. And so learn more about Australia. And the culture as well as that our volunteers work in a teacher aid capacity where they're [00:03:00] in classrooms supporting teachers, working with small groups of students again, developing their literacy skills.\n\nRad. What do you think it means to have a older adult Australian in that young person's life? Yeah. In general. I think that, our volunteers play a really important role in role modeling. For the newly arrived refugee and migrants. They really teach them a lot about Australian culture, Australian values.\n\nFor example, one of our volunteers, Gav, the first thing he does when he meets a young person for the first time is he shakes their hand and he teaches them how to shake hands. That's lovely. He's been a wonderful role model for some of our disengaged young men. We had a a boy who graduated last year who was very disengaged throughout year nine and year 10.\n\nGav is a a retired [00:04:00] senior sergeant and he actually was a wonderful role model for that young man and taught him a lot about life and about how to be a strong young man. And that young person now aspires to be a police officer. So it's that wonderful kind of role modeling. And they get that because they spend that dedicated amount of time with them every week, so they get to develop that relationship.\n\nAnd for some of those refugee and migrant students, they don't have any other people outside their culture that they can go to, to ask about various things that they see in the community, and they don't understand what's going on there. Yeah. So I don't know how much to know about Tom met, but essentially a bunch of old fellas hanging out, they're retired and they like get lonely like everyone else, and I think that's incredible just in terms of having that group support.\n\nBut then to be able, like I talked with a bunch of them the other day and they talk so fondly about being able to still give back. [00:05:00] Yeah. What do you think the effect of this program is on them, do you think? I think for them it keeps them young, it keeps them connected to the youth of today. Last year we actually had an intergenerational games in our assembly hall where we had our volunteers in our young people participating in.\n\nIn sporty kind of games in the hall, I guess we made it into a big competition. It was the best time. So I think it, it really makes them feel connected to young people and also what's going on in the community. 'cause they're interacting with a lot of people when they come in here, they're interacting with the office staff, saying hello to them having a chat.\n\nThey're coming down here, they're interacting with teachers in this space, and then with the young people as well. So they get to see a whole variety of things in that one or two hours that they're with us. And what do you reckon the compound impact is on? When both the young people and the Tom Net volunteer crew go into the community and talk about what they [00:06:00] do, what impact do you think that has on the community?\n\nI think that for the volunteers, they're learning a lot about the different cultures and language groups of students that we're getting in. So they're able to share firsthand knowledge of specific cultural groups with the community. So they're actually transferring a lot of that into cultural knowledge out into the community, which is really important, especially in Toowoomba.\n\nWe're a refugee welcome zone. We have huge numbers of Yia refugees. In fact, Kurdish is our second most widely spoken language in Toowoomba now. I think for the young people they get to learn about Australian culture and Australian values and attitudes and beliefs. The kind of education that you don't always get in a classroom.\n\nYeah. They're learning that from these role models. Yeah. What's your hopes and dreams for this program as it rolls into the future? Is there growth? Is it the same? Do you just hope it like. It's consistent where that I think we're, I really like where we're at the moment. We have a really a good number of volunteers.\n\nWe have someone in [00:07:00] basically for every hour of every day. We have a volunteer in this space. We have a good balance. 25% is a really good balance I think because we. No, I don't. Okay. Actually, I disagree with that. Okay. Go back. I disagree with that. Rewind. What did I say? Rewind? I can't remember what I said.\n\nWhat was the question? But what do you Yeah. Do you hope, oh, this is it growth thing or it stays the same thing? What do you do you want need more support? Is there enough support? What's the, what's your general, and you don't have to say any controversy. I think at the moment, I think that at the moment where we're at is really good.\n\nWe have a volunteer here. Most lessons for most days. I think it is a good amount. However, I do think that Toowoomba will continue to grow its refugee and migrant population because it certainly is the destination of choice for our yadi population in Australia. We're finding people moving from the other states.\n\nTo Toowoomba. So I think our numbers of students will grow, therefore, our demand for [00:08:00] volunteers will continue to grow. What does it take though to run this? Surely there's some kind of resources required to run it from somewhere we it does require resources, but the number one resource it requires is the human resource.\n\nSo our Learn to Read program, we, we have readers, books, et cetera. A lot of them have been donated by the community. We have purchased some of them, but our number one resource and our most important resource is, and I think always will be human beings and people who have time and are willing to give up some of that time.\n\nIt's just fascinating if you're able to measure the impact of the program against. Like other very expensive programs and look at what is that? What makes this successful as important to you based activity? I think there's lots of commercially produced reading programs that schools and in institutions can purchase.\n\nBut I think you cannot replace a human being sitting one-on-one with a child [00:09:00] listening to them. Read with them, talk about what they read. It's that dialogic approach to reading. Which builds comprehension and literacy. Do you know, if this happens around Australia or this particular strategy, this Learn to Read program is adapted from mill Perra State High School, which I visited that school and saw their Learn to Read program and I took, I took the best of what they had and then we adapted it here to suit our school context.\n\nAmazing. I love when that shit happens. So much good stuff already happening. Yeah. How you doing? Cool. Anything else that you wanted to talk about, you've always wanted to talk about that we didn't talk about? Oh, I just I just want to, I guess thank TOMNET and what they've been able to do for our school and for our a ELD program because we would not have such a successful program without the support of TOMNET and their volunteers.\n\nIt's a good shout. It is. People struggle with that Shout out stuff. You [00:10:00] did such a good job. Cool. Okay. That's, see it. I just think.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Nic on Diagrama\n\n\\*\\*Nic:\\*\\* [00:00:00] My first experience of youth cool youth. I guess my first experience with youth detention centers was really hearing it displayed in Australia around the solution for working with complex naughty. Young people. And in my hometown of Brisbane, we've seen a lot of media around the impacts of youth crime, whether that be towards people losing their lives or whether it be towards people's houses their safe places getting taken away from them.\n\nSo I guess growing up the solution was. Was portrayed was to lock young people up. But now actually realizing that locking people up isn't the solution to making communities safer. What I've now learned through seeing the research and what's happening. In, in Australia is when we lock people up, they're more likely [00:01:00] to re-offend and they're more likely to cause more harm to the community.\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't believe that people should face consequences for their actions, but I guess I've been really interested in actually if what I had always thought was the solution to someone. Who has done something wrong would be to go into these places. But now knowing that is making them more likely to re-offend how and what is out there to actually help young people.\n\nAnd through through conversations and through seeing Ben's passion for. Youth Justice, the diagram model came to light. And I can remember when Ben first told me, the facts about diagram, I was interested in what is actually different to what they're doing?\n\nThat still sounds like they're locking young people up. It still sounds like people are serving a sentence. And I guess that's what I'd heard is so many people passionately talking about. Diagram, but I wasn't too sure actually what was different to what diagram was doing to say what we're doing in [00:02:00] Australia.\n\nAnd you've had some time in with detention around program and I suppose got to talk to a bunch of people around what that was like. What, how did that feel? And what were the main takeaways of Europeans going in versus what.\n\nWhat I experienced or what I've experienced in the youth justice system in Australia is very similar to the stereotypes and stigmas that have been portrayed to me my whole life. It's going into a place that's got high security, heightened confinement. There is security guards and there's offenders.\n\nAnd there's people that are in there because they're bad people. And in my experiences in Australia, that's been the exactly the same feeling when I go in there. There's a level of high level of security. There's a high level of enforcement and rigor, and you really have to challenge yourself to.\n\n[00:03:00] Look at these people not as offenders, but as young people. And going to, to my first ever youth detention center and seeing a young person surrounded by multiple guards who is just bored and who is treated like a criminal every day, I think was incredibly challenging for me.\n\nAnd then to sit down in a room. An art room where when I went to school, the art room had brushes and pencils and shit to make art, and there's like a box of recycled paper and no pens. And then to be like, Hey, can we use pencils? It's we'll have to get a clearance for that. Just blew my mind when we're in a room that's completely locked with like multiple guards and two young people like the ratio would've been like seven adults to, a couple of young people was pretty confronting to be reminded of that stereotype that I had learned.[00:04:00] \n\nBut I guess connecting with young people in that environment and asking them what do they want? I was. Encouraged that they weren't content or happy with what had been being provided. And they were willing to, or they were desiring something that was different. And I think in some of the centers, the people that were working in there were really challenged by that context that they're working with and excited to innovate in that space.\n\nWe came a long way to look at some centers from two. Tell us a little bit about, like from your perceptions and knowledge to what you saw. Arriving in Spain, I guess I was really curious and open-minded to what is this difference that, that I'm gonna experience and. We traveled a short period of time down the highway and pulled straight off the highway and there was like a center and I was like, cool.\n\nThis very clearly looking at it, you could tell it [00:05:00] was a, a detention center with big poles at the front and a little security office, and you're asked for your id. And so I guess those stereotypes kept on being reinforced around now I'm being reminded that this place has got security and it's got confinement.\n\nBut then the doors were opened and there were no guards following us, and there were adults walking around and I guess walking into the center manager's office. It was a place of hope and prosperity and not being able to speak Spanish. It was actually really interesting to observe people talking about their center.\n\nBut not actually knowing what they were talking about. Seeing people in their team. Excited and proud to talk about what they were doing to show passion, to show care and to be humans in their service delivery. And for that to be translated back in, in was interesting.\n\nBut the most interesting thing for me was just [00:06:00] seeing. People really passionate about what they were doing, talking about what they were doing. But then I guess like my very judgmental mind was like, here's like a center manager who's like talking about what we're doing and all well and good, but see it firsthand.\n\nAnd then we're like let's go and walk around the facility and there's not 15 locked doors to get into a place and it's not. Marching around and, radioing to each section. It was a bunch of passionate, leaders and educators walking around and after showing us like the education facility and the medical facility, it's let's go diagram on a tiered system where they have everything from people being autonomous.\n\nTo monitor it or some other language, I think was like the most high risk people. And it's let's start here. And then again, like my judgment is I'm gonna see high risk young people in a room and what am I about to experience? And the center manager walks into [00:07:00] this room and there's like this beautiful smell of delicious lunch.\n\nAnd there's an educator sitting down at a table with four young people with. Cutlery with delicious food, and the center manager, again, in, in Spanish puts his arm around this young person and makes a joke like, that was funny, but don't do that again. And I was like, what's going on here? And so this, this center manager is got his arm around.\n\nThis young person, has looked him in the eye, has almost, said to him in nonverbal ways. Maybe don't do that again. But I love you. And then asking the center manager what the fuck's going on there? And he said, oh, we ran a program and he ran away. It's like someone runs away from a, from the school I grew up in, there's there's sirens and there's lights and there's reports and there's paperwork.\n\nAnd there probably was for that center manager, he probably had. [00:08:00] An investigation. He probably had instant reports. He probably had to review risk things, but at that point in time, he just saw that young person as someone that, tried something that stuffed up. But also in that environment, he was okay to still be human.\n\nAnd you think about this naughty person sitting in the corner and stuff being taken away and. So much has been taken away for these young people to get them to where they, they were and so much is still being taken away from them. But in that environment, the educator showed a level of connection and understanding and that really stood spout to me.\n\nBut yeah, like that was the highest risk people. And then you go through, the next stage and the next stage and young people that have got. Photos up on their room wall and there's color and there's vibrance and there's a level of, I was interested at I don't like PlayStation.\n\nAnd it would have to be a really bad day for me to sit down and play PlayStation, but [00:09:00] there's young people just allowed to play PlayStation and to play card games and stuff, and I just kept on thinking this is not what we have in our. Or from what I've seen in our centers and being really curious to being like actually this just makes sense.\n\nLike we don't need to strip away everything from someone to teach them a lesson. We actually need to empower people. And yeah, I guess these moments just kept on happening where as someone who loves making stuff and someone who has spoken to young people in detention about their hopes and dreams, they're like.\n\nI wanna become an electrician. I wanna make stuff. And me being like, cool, like the only way to learn this stuff is with tools and trying, but then being like there's no way you can get a screwdriver into to this place. And then walking into their workshop and there's, I. Tools everywhere there's grinders up on benches, there's a metal press that, could chop off every finger in a second.\n\nThere's electrical [00:10:00] circuits that are more complex and risky and dangerous than what I had just done in my own electrical course as a, as an educated person. In, in, in Australia, I think was these reminders of what the. What diagram is doing. And I said to David, like, how do you manage that risk with all these weapons around?\n\nAnd he is we don't see these as weapons. We understand the risk. We we assess what the young person needs, but then also we treat these tools as tools and we treat these young people as young people. And once you. Enable that trust, a lot of the risk is overcome. And I thought so much about that in a sense that at every stage people were treated as people.\n\nAnd life was managed as life, which has complexity and it has nuance and all those sorts of things. I think we overcomplicate [00:11:00] things and create systems that I. Employ a lot of people create reasons for politicians to get elected to be able to have government services that they can say that they're helping a bunch of people with what's after saying this and then thinking about what's the simplest way we can do this?\n\nWhere's your head in terms of like a. For like challenges that diagram might face, but also that opportunity to do something that's simple and can cut through a lot of that systemic.\n\nI think in Australia there's a lot of people who are trying and there's a lot of examples of extraordinary programs that have been stood up. I think unfortunately though there is, that is a minority. And we need to empower those people who have found really innovative ways to support young people in our Australian context, [00:12:00] to be respected and to be empowered, to keep on doing what they're doing.\n\nAnd I think we need to really remind ourselves around what's the long game of thinking and if we actually acknowledge that for. It would be very unlikely for someone to be locked up for their whole life, especially when they are a young person. So their confinement and their punishment is only a small chapter in their overall existence.\n\nSo if we are going to want to support these young people to be better, we need to, if we are detaining them. They need to leave in a better place than when they came. And unfortunately, from what I know, that's not the the majority of cases. And there's always gonna be cases where, you know some people aren't at the right time to be supported or a program won't support [00:13:00] them.\n\nBut I think, we need to shift from when young people come into care leaving in a worse way than they came. To actually the majority of people when they come in leaving in a better place than they came. And I think that's where, extraordinary leaders and programs in Australia have got the evidence for their programs.\n\nAnd we need to be inspired by programs like Diagrama in showing us that, like what we're doing is pretty it's an outlier. And if there's things that we want our country to be proud of, it's probably not making people worse. It's probably actually saying, Hey, we saw a young person who has made some mistakes, has grown up in intergenerational trauma, has probably been abused themselves, and we've had an opportunity to support that young person through them making a a series of mistakes to, to be in there.\n\nAnd we've got this captive time to support someone. [00:14:00] How cool would it be if they leave and they're in a much better place and society hadn't failed them? Rather than us saying that person came in and they left in a more damaged way than they started, just doesn't make sense to me. Brad, what else do you wanna say?\n\nFor the last 10 years, I've been really passionate about what makes a connected community and. I think that, what we do as a society, as a western society is we love putting things in boxes and naming things and trying to rationalise things. And I think if we, what I've learned is that we can very easily retrospectively rationalise something, but actually we need to go back to basic.\n\nAnd really sense make with what we're trying to do and stop trying to put things in boxes or programs and systems and collectively look at our responsibilities as communities to [00:15:00] support the people that we're working with. So I think that, to, to change will take. A lot of resource and time and bravery.\n\nBut I think if we actually start to collaborate on this I think that there can be some really great changes made. And I think we need to remind ourselves around what is the intention and who is who is the person that we are working for? And a lot of people say, I'm employed by this program, or I'm employed by this.\n\nProject or government or thing. And young people are some of the biggest employers of, security guards across the country. And so it isn't the government that's employing 'em it's because those young people are in that situation. And how cool would we, would it be if we flipped that?\n\nAnd said that young people employ really amazing educators that support those people in becoming the next electricians or the next actors or the next storytellers. And really, like [00:16:00] we've, it seems like we've got the resource there. It's just being pointed in the wrong places. And so if we can actually shift that, that resource, everyone's gonna be okay.\n\nPeople are, might lose their one job, but another job will be. Found and young people are still gonna make mistakes, but also young people are still gonna need education. And so we're not actually excluding this like one, one set of people. We're all gonna still get sick. We're all still gonna make mistakes.\n\nWe're all still gonna need education, but let's actually allocate the resource in a different way.\n\nAnything else? That's it. No thanks for having me here, Ben Mate.\n\n",

The wind is coming through.\n\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, I can, I can steal the wind there. The\n\nSpeaker 9: rain on the plane falls mainly in Spain or the other way round.\n\nSpeaker 8: Tell us, you just have to tell us your name and spell it again. Sorry. Beautiful. You can talk to me, you don't have to talk to that.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSpeaker 9: Drew Nichols, DRW Nichols. I am the, uh, operations manager at Foothills Community Care.\n\nSpeaker 8: Cool. Rus, tell me a tiny bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I'm the operations manager, so I, no, so I, I live in the hills. Uh, I've lived in and around the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It's a beautiful part of the world to be, um, I've got a real heart for, for community and for people finding their place.\n\nAnd so particularly the community meal night, there's nothing better than someone finding their place at the table with cutlery on one side and salt and pepper and flowers. It's a really beautiful thing. Uh, it's that great equalizer. Once you sit around the table, you find community, uh, and everyone's the same.\n\nSpeaker 8: That's [00:01:00] amazing. What's this soaring sky community thing? What, like how does that match together and does it match together? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 9: so part of that table, it's all that dignity. And so a big, a big thing of what we want to do is dignity. Uh, and so something like orange sky, uh, is a, is a, is a great service for some of our folks who, uh.\n\nThat is not a, a lived experience for them. They're not able to access clean clothes, and when you don't have clean clothes, you don't feel very good. You get really stinky. Uh, we've got some people who, um, uh, need to be applying for jobs as well. So when you don't have good clothes, you feel stinky, you feel pretty rubbish about yourself.\n\nSo Orange Sky's a great service and it means that people can access, uh, fresh, clean clothes and it just, you know, it has amazing boost to their mental health and general wellbeing.\n\nSpeaker 8: Something about this place, philosophy, values, safety. What it's, what, what do you think that provides A safe place where people feel like that's, they want to all do that.\n\nYep. You know what I mean? I don't see any behavior that is like, um, sort of [00:02:00] going outta the, the mold or causing any trouble. Yep. Where does that come from and how does that get built?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I think a big thing for us is, you know, we, we, this mill here is in the Furniture Gallery village and the village is, it's off Berwood Highway.\n\nNot many people go through it. It, it kind of comes from a real sense for me around the local community and care for community. You know, when you know your neighbor, when you know their friend, you take care of them. And so I think a similar thing is translated here. We're in a smaller community, but people really care for one another.\n\nAnd when you get to see the lived experiences, you hear the stories for, for some of our folks, they hear similar stories from one another. And I think when you combine stories, people together and food, there's this beautiful fermentation of, of community care and it can be people at their best,\n\nSpeaker 8: so Right.\n\nUm, this whole idea of conversation, so the lens itself more to me, that term [00:03:00] story, how does stories. Continue to build what you have here and what, what do you think should happen with those stories over time? Yeah. Like, and how does that continue to support the longevity and the future of this place?\n\nSpeaker 9: So stories are really powerful.\n\nStories are a reminder of past, they're a reminder of emotion and feeling and experience. But quite often that those experiences are the foundation for what the future looks like. So I think about people that live in boarding houses. Hearing their perspective and ongoingly hearing their perspective is a really important thing because it's a reminder of how people in the community live who are much worse off than me.\n\nAnd whether it's boarding houses or people that sleep in tents in the forests, or people who are sleeping in cars, we, they have lots of those people. Uh, we can't forget those stories. We need to keep hearing those stories, uh, because they remind us and, and really encourage us of the importance of this sort of thing.\n\nUh, because there's lots of [00:04:00] complex reasons why people don't have secure housing. Uh, but bigger than that, what we can do is we can provide a place of safety and that one piece of safety, that one bit of, uh, listening to story, uh, can have ripple effects that go well and truly beyond just one community meal night.\n\nThey allow us to, uh, think bigger ongoing, what we can do to make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 8: Um, those stories, how do. Ripple out to people that at the moment don't really care or don't have access to knowing what's actually happening. For people that are struggling, is there a chance to, I dunno if it's changing people's minds or even just touching a few more people.\n\nMm. Is there a better way to do that? Like, do you have to force feed naturally? What's the way in which you do that in a way that's like you have here, right? Like a natural. Experience organic.\n\nSpeaker 9: I think it's a bit of everything. I think, you know, our world is so fast paced now. Social media is, is running at [00:05:00] lightning pace.\n\nI think it's a few different things. I, I think it's, it, it is certainly around messaging in a really tight, short space, getting the powerful message out there, whether that's social media or whether that's in some other form. I think it's that. But I, I, I think more than that, I, I, I, I think it's, it's the long.\n\nA difficult discipline driver, just continuing to say the same thing again and again and again. Uh, and that's can be challenging and you get a bit frustrated. Uh, but I think, you know, it's, it's seems like connecting with your local ministers. It's, you know, it's politicians, it's department heads, it's other agencies that we work with who should have a footprint here.\n\nThey say they do, but they don't. Uh, so it's, it's, it's the long hard stuff where you just have to keep, uh, advocating for people. Hmm. Uh, at a corporate level, at a government level, at a support level. Uh, because if you don't do that, the, the story just gets lost and life just moves on.\n\nSpeaker 8: And last question.\n\nYou're doing such a good job. Um, I do a lot with [00:06:00] young people, especially young people that have, um, too much contact with this system of youth justice and those areas is, do you see young people here? And then also what do.\n\nWhat's, what's that opportunity to capture those kids that maybe like, it's not cool to come here? Or like, what's that maybe here?\n\nSpeaker 9: So, yeah. Yeah. Great question. So I think going back to the ideas of community, I think I've been a young person, uh, I know what it's like not to fit in. Uh, and so I think, you know, particular I'm thinking about young men particularly.\n\nYou need mob, you need people that, that where you have a sense of identity and a sense of security that comes from that. That's missing in a lot of young men, particularly girls as well. That sense of a, your story within a bigger story, that stuff is missing. So I think something like a meal night here, we can't do all of that.\n\nBut if you can get a young person engaged [00:07:00] developmentally with older people, with people who might be different from you, but have an interest in you and show an interest in you, that over time can begin to make a difference. So I think there's lots of things that we can be doing better to engage the younger people.\n\nUm, but I'd be really, really keen to see what else we can do because I fully appreciate people need purpose. People need a place to call home. People need a place where they see themselves within a bigger story and places where that doesn't happen, that can lead down a really difficult path.\n\nSpeaker 8: Geez, jeez, dude.\n",

I think we're, I think we're, I think we're good. Maybe. Maybe we can be more light. Yeah. Okay. Good. Alright. First of all, you said tell me your full name and then spell it out for me.\n\nDid great. Okay. Well, my name is Jim Albury, and it's spelled different to the town on the border. It's A-U-L-B-U-R-Y. Cool. Awesome. Okay, Jim, tell me, tell me a little bit about yourself. How do you like to talk about yourself and introduce yourself? Um, I try not to talk about myself too much, but, um, I'm not a real big speaker because my wife does most of the speaking.\n\nUh, she won't like to hear that. But, uh, um. I've been a salesman, as in, in my [00:01:00] life at some time. So obviously, uh, you, you gotta have a little bit of, um, that. But, um, I started out life back, you know, in the sixties working, I'm talking about, and, um, moved to Sydney. Um, lived in Sydney till, uh, probably the late seventies.\n\nUh, spent a bit of time overseas in Aspen. Where I skied a bit. And, um, I did a few other silly things that you do when you're young. And, uh, when I came back here, I, uh, I married a lady that had, um, two little children and, uh, we moved to a little town called Black Butt, which is, uh, not very far from here.\n\nAnd, um, uh, so we had about 20 acres there for a little while. And, um. Uh, until 2003. In that time, in that 20 odd years, um, I worked at, uh, Ong Power Station, um, which was fairly well [00:02:00] known. It's, um, uh, in Queensland anyway, uh, coal fired Power Station. Uh, I really enjoyed my time there. Uh, retired from there and, uh, moved to Toowoomba about 2005 after a marriage breakup.\n\nAnd, um. Anyway, uh, uh, after that, um, yeah. And, and as far as coming to, uh, Tom Net's concerned, um, my love of music, um, drew me to, uh, I was at a concert, a free concert put on by the, the local council, and there was a chap scene there and he mentioned Tom Net. And after the show was over, I approached him and he said, look, we've got a, a little group.\n\nWould you like to join us? You know, if you can sing. So I did. And that was, uh, I can't remember how many years ago that was probably 10 or 12 years ago. And, um, so we, what we were doing is sing at nursing homes and, um, uh, it was a little bit [00:03:00] daunting to start with, um, because, you know, most of the people either were not competent or.\n\nYou know, didn't understand that we were there, but when we started singing, especially the older songs, the sixties and seventies rock and roll, which was my, um, my bit, um, the people seemed to oh, you know, sprout up a bit. So I knew then that there was something happening in their head. The music's is got a, it's a great sort of a leveler and, um, even though the body was.\n\nHad it, I say, um, or on the way out, it, um, the, the mind was still going and the music, and especially some of the old songs of the sixties, which they would've grown up with the same as I did. So it, it brought something back in their mind. And from there, I've just maintained it. Unfortunately. Um, COVID came along and, um, a couple of the guys moved to, uh, Warwick, [00:04:00] which meant that they couldn't be regular up in Toowoomba.\n\nAnd, uh, so the, the Tom Net minstrels, as we were known in those days, uh, sort of folded or did fold for a couple of years, but recently, um, I joined up with another member, uh, of Tom Net, um, Glen Green and Glen and I, uh, we now, uh, the Tom Net minstrels, there's only two of us. We don't play any instruments, but what we do do is we've got a lot of backing music.\n\nAnd, and I've just got a little laptop that I take with us and, um, and all the words come up on the screen and, you know, we don't have to be real, you know, we don't have to be real rock stars to, to, to get into that. And, um, only last week, uh, I was, uh, at a, a nurse nursing home that we hadn't been to before.\n\nAnd, um, the lady there said that you brought a lot of joy to the residents. And that's, that's where I get my joy out, seeing them light up and, and. Even though [00:05:00] a lot of them can't, um, do a lot anymore, you can see them mouthing the words and they know the, the words from the old songs. And, um, we've got a repertoire of probably a hundred, 120 odd songs of backing music, mainly that, that era 50 sixties and seventies.\n\nAnd, uh, because that's about the age of the residents in that are in a lot of these homes. Mm-hmm. Um, so. You know, even though the likes of most of them, you know, Frank Sinatra and all them are gone, um, it, we can still sing their songs and they can So Good. Yeah. So, um, what is it that keeps you coming back to, to that every week, every month?\n\nUm, like I said, I've been, I've been coming here now for about, I don't know, I forget, uh, I think it's at least 10 or 12 years. And, um, the thing that I like about, it's the comradery. There's, there's no, uh, social structure here. There's no, [00:06:00] you are better than I am, or I'm better than you are, sort of thing.\n\nUh, we all come from different backgrounds. We're all of a similar age, you know, we're all in their seventies, some eighties, and there's even a couple in their nineties. Um, and as long as we've still got our mobility and we can still, um, use the old brainpower, um, it's amazing the things that I've learned from.\n\nSome of the guys that are here, um, you know, things that I didn't know and I hopefully they've probably learned a bit off me. Um, you know, over the years. And, you know, you, you can, every day that you come here is a different day. You dunno what you're gonna get, you know, it's, it's a bit like the old mystery box.\n\nYou know, what am I gonna get when I lift the lid? And, um, because, uh, you know, and, and there's new people coming, not regular. Um, we went for a period of time there, we. Uh, where we didn't have any new people coming, but lately we've been getting a lot of people. I say a lot, you know, to us, [00:07:00] four or five is a lot, you know, um, you know, where we've got a, well, I believe we've got about 290 members now, including the new Locky Valley.\n\nUm, uh, things that we've opened down there, uh, won it get and won it lately. And, um, so, uh. Yeah. That, that's, that's what keeps me coming back is the fact that I can get up in the morning and now I'll come down here and I, I dunno what I'm gonna, who's gonna be here. Um, and like anywhere you, um, after a while, you, you get to know a lot of guys and some you like better than others.\n\nBut I can't honestly say that there's anyone in Tom net that, you know, we've, um, crossed paths or, or anything like that, you know, that had a, had a bad word. So, um, and I think it's, it's probably indicative of the fact that we're of a certain age and we don't need that sort of stuff anymore. We're not competing in that.[00:08:00] \n\nAnd what about the places that you guys hang out? Like what, what do they, what do you think they, um, think about Tom Net in terms of the school and the other, on the nursing homes and things? Do they reflect back to you what it means? And, um, the fact that we get asked back to me is the fact that we must be doing something right.\n\nUh, like I said, last Friday we did one at a, a new, um, place we hadn't been to before, and the lady there who, and it's usually women who run the, um, the, uh, social side of it. And, uh, she contacted Anthony, our man here in the office, and, uh, she'd heard about us and uh, we went out there and we. We sung, we only sing for about an hour.\n\n'cause it's about all we physically can sort of do. And um, and, and also it's not any us it's them, you know, like, um, you, you can go into a room, there'll be 20 people and by the time you finish singing, there'll be 12 mm. Um, and, and it used to worry me, I was thinking, gee, am I doing [00:09:00] something about, is my singing that bad?\n\nBut, you know, you gotta bear in mind that these people have different. Physical and needs and that sort of thing. So, uh, so now, you know, I just take that and it's nice that, that we're bringing some joy to people. That's, that's the big, big thing, you know, just making people feel a little bit better. Um, yeah.\n\nWhat do you think the impact is on like, um, being able to match, um. People who are young, with people who are older and have that relationship, like what do you think that does for a young person to have an older person that care about them? It's, it's very easy for us, and I, and I say us as I'm referring to Tom Net as a, an older person's network, um, to be critical of young ones.\n\nUm. But we've all gotta be mindful that, and I [00:10:00] say this quite often to people that we were, we were there once, and it probably, you know, it wasn't, it might've been 50 years ago, but at least we were, you know, we were there once and, uh, I've got, uh, two sons and a daughter and, and three grandsons and, um, you know, watching them grow up.\n\nUh, all the boys are now in their forties, but, um, the, the grandkids are only, you know, six. And so, um. And just seeing the, the difference in them as opposed to when I was raising children. Um. Mm-hmm. And, you know, I, I'm, I must say I'm very proud of my, my children for, for the way they're raising their children, um, that sort of thing.\n\nYeah. But, uh, I dunno if that answers your question. No. Amazing. I spend a lot of time with young people who get into trouble a lot and, um, I think one of the things that stands out for me is. A connection with someone, and especially when, um, [00:11:00] I think when there's a, a older person that takes interest in them.\n\nYeah. It makes a different difference. Yeah. When it, when it's like a teacher or a mentor that's supposed to do that. Yeah. It's unique. We've got a, um, uh, a school here. That, um, I think other people have probably mentioned it to you, um, that Tom net supports and, um, I, I went there for a short period of time and, um, and at the time I was importing American cars, I, I used to go to the states a bit and buy cars and bring 'em over to Australia and, um, and I found that that was always a good opener.\n\nWith especially the boys. And that's all I dealt with with the boys that, you know, and sometimes if I had to, uh, I can remember one day driving up to the school that's not far from here in, in a Mustang I just bought over from America. And, uh, you know, that just opened so many conversations, you know, tell me about the motor size and tell me about this and tell me about that.[00:12:00] \n\nSo, uh, I, you know, that was, that was good. And you can, you can relate to the kids then. Through something like that, that they've got a common interest with you. Um, but, uh, it, it, you know, we, we, we see on the, on the, on the, uh, news every night about kids going, you know, bad and stealing cars and all that sort of thing.\n\nBut, and, and my wife gets very upset about it, and what I try to say is that it's, it's only that much. Or that big a thing. It's, you know, it's only a small portion. We're not talking about all the kids. Um, it's, it's, I blame the media a lot for that because it, it's a, um, uh, a, a good, good, good story is not, doesn't make the news like a bad story does, you know, for someone there's a car crash or something that's gonna hit the headlines before, you know, someone's taking an older person and taking them out to lunch or something, you know?[00:13:00] \n\nYeah. Um, what do you think is, um, what do you think would be like to have Tom Nets in more places than Toowoomba? Like a Brisbane and a Sydney or whatever. Do you think that's a thing, or do you, um, think it's a more of a Toowoomba based thing? It's, it's not, not, well, it's only a Toowoomba based thing because it, it started here and, and the, the, to keep a place like this running.\n\nIt's like anything. It takes dollars. And um, and you almost gotta go with cap in hand to the government and say, look, we need some more money. And, and of course you've gotta then show proof. Why do you want it, how are you gonna spend it? And, and our, um, I think our line is that, well, you know, there's so many men commit suicide every year.\n\nUm, since I've been here, not one of our members has committed suicide. Um. I'm not saying there hasn't been plenty that have, have thought about it. [00:14:00] Um, and we are only at, at lunch today. Uh, just before you came, we were talking about the very same thing about people we know that, um, have been in car accidents or single person car accident that just happened to hit a, a huge tree and that was the end of them sort of thing.\n\nAnd, uh. There'll never be any proof that, that they committed suicide, you know? But you know, when, when you, when you see that, or you, and, and I can think of a couple of people, not here in Tom, but just outside acquaintance that I know that have done that. So, cool. Um, we've gone through all the topics and themes, but is there anything else that you think we missed that you wanted to brought up or, um, no.\n\nI, I think. The, the thing is that I, that Tom Net's doing a great job. Um, and, and I trust that, you know, what you saw today at that meeting, and that was you just walk in [00:15:00] cold off the street for, so it wasn't rehearsed or anything. Um, and, and you couldn't get any of those older fellas here to do that sort of thing.\n\nIt's, it's pretty straightforward and up upfront and, um, you know, you met a pretty good cross section of, of guys here today. Um, bill, who's in his nineties, uh, the, the, um, uh, the guy that owns it. Nice old hold that you guys were talking about. Yeah. Um, and that's only one of his cars. He's got a few. And, um, so, you know, you you, you'd take guys like that hurt, that have lived a lot of life and seen a lot of things and, and one of the guys here today at lunch, it might have been, says that if you look at our lives from, we've seen.\n\nF not personally, but our generation has seen it's gone from flight, you know, where there was no airplanes. Only the, the dream of it. We've seen airplanes, ta, we've seen man walk on the moon. Um, and I think I was [00:16:00] reading somewhere recently where if you are under 45 or something like that, which, you know, you'd, you'd fall into that category.\n\nYou wouldn't have seen Armstrong walk on the moon. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I can remember as clear as, as if it was yesterday that I, my boss who I was working for at the time had just bought a new minero now in 1969. That was the car to have. And he threw me the keys and he said, go and fill the car up. And I took it down to the local garage and they had a little black and white tv, which is all we had in those days, in the garage.\n\nAnd, and, and he was Armstrong climbing down the ladder. And, uh, so, you know, I was there to see it and albeit, you know, local garage sort of thing. But, uh, I was alive when it happened. Um, yeah. So, but none of my, none of my children were, you weren't, uh, you know, you, you, you know about it and things like that, but Yeah.\n\nYeah. And one, one of one, I just gotta say one of my, uh, biggest [00:17:00] gripes I suppose is we don't teach. In the schools anymore. Australian history. Mm-hmm. At least I'm, I don't think we do. Um, I watch some of these quiz shows that are on overnight and some of the questions that come up and I just answer them like that and there'll be a young person there and they got no idea.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Sorry. Alright, we're gonna.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I actually quite like this frame. I'm going to tell Nick, I'll be like, what? You've nailed it. It's going to be the best frame. All right, just tell us your name and spell it. It's awesome too. Just kick us off. Surname or just? First and surname. Okay. Oh, hi. Look, I'm Vicky Sorenson. Yeah, sorry. Say that again. Good. Go. Oh, hi. I'm Vicky Sorenson. Do I need to spell it? Yeah. Vicky, V-I-C-K-I, S-O-R-R-E-N-S-O-N. Sick. Tell us a tiny bit about yourself. Oh, look, I've recently retired 12 months. I'm from a pretty hectic role. And, you know, I've always been fairly community minded. Food bank. Started with food bank a long time ago. I've worked with Orange Sky. Now I'm happily supporting Tramby House with our food service. And, yeah, it's just fantastic. I love it. And it's the cold face. It's where it's happening. You know, that's get the basics right. Tummy, food in your tummy, your laundry done, you know, some conversation. You know, that's what I do. That's what I love. What was the first time you sort of heard about Orange Sky? Oh, look, I think I might have seen it on Facebook. And I thought it was a great story. The two guys that started it up. And then the massive Google sponsorship that they secured. So I followed it up. And, yeah, I worked with Orange Sky for about 12 months. Became a team leader driving the van around attached to Rua. It was fantastic. I loved it. Yeah. We were talking before. You were talking about that connection piece. Why do you think it's important not just to get the laundry done, but to connect properly? Well, really it's a twofold thing. You know, you hear, yes, the practical side of it is to do the laundry. But the other side is engaging with our service recipients. You know, that's what they're here for. So, you know, I'm not here to try and solve everyone's problems. But I can be a happy face and I can show some interest because I'm genuinely interested in people. I've got a story. Everyone's got a story. You know? So I think it's great. We need to share our stories. And that then becomes a bit more normalized. You know, we were all kind of doing our little bit for whatever we can. Orange Sky has recently finished its podcast. It's called The F Word. And The F Word is like they use as friends. Yep. I'm guessing we might get run over here in a sec. Is that going to happen? That might be it. That might be Orange Harvest kind of. Maybe. I'm not sure. We'll see where he goes. See where he goes. It might be interesting to see where he goes. Yeah. You going in there? It's great, isn't it? That should be a podcast itself. I don't think it should be. Yeah. So I'll just make sure you're a little crispy in the brain. You got that fuzzy lens on me? Yeah. What's that? I don't know what that is. I've got my hands. I should do that every time, but I forget. Okay. Yeah. Orange Sky's got this podcast. It's called The F Word. It's about friendship and friends. Yes. That's the terminology that's used for people who use Orange Sky. Yes. And I'm just struck by what is this power of friendship not just for people doing it tough, but for everyday people. Yeah. Like how do you find this idea of friendship and how do you find this idea of friendship? I think it's really important to be able to do that. I think it's really important to be able to do that. Yeah. I think it's really important to be able to do that. I think it's really important to be able to do that. Yeah. I think it's important to be able to do that. I think it's important to be able to do that. Friendship and friends being a really strong supportive area of life, I guess. Yeah. Well, you know, we all need to feel some sort of connection, don't we? And a friend can take on all sorts of things. It can be a close friend. It can just be an acquaintance. It doesn't have to be. You can be as involved or not as you like. So by reaching out, a smile, being friendly, I see my role with Trambie House as a hospitality side of it. So hospitality comes with a smile and being welcoming and inclusive. You know? That's all part of being a decent human, isn't it? And Trambi, tell us what it is. It's hectic in there. There's people everywhere, there's stuff. What's telling us a bit about Trambi? Yeah, am I allowed to be that? Sure, yeah, I don't know, are you? Yeah, well, Trambi House, I don't know, yeah. You could talk about Trambi as in what you see and feel, I guess. Oh, look, it's a wonderful, it's a destination where people can come together. We've got street vet, we've got street doctor, street law, streets, you know, so many services here. And the volunteers like myself, we put the food out and we keep, you know, just trying to keep people fed and engaged and, you know, we don't step outside of our scope of works. We've got beautiful support teams that do all of that. Lot of security, we're very safe here. You know, you're dealing with vulnerable people that have got all sorts of experiences. So, you know, I feel very privileged to be here. I feel very fortunate to be part of that and I really like it. What's this idea of like, for people doing it tough, having different services collaborate, I guess, and having services that are staying in the lane but supporting specific people? Yeah, there's gotta be a certain crossover, hasn't there? And I think we do that really well. Our teams here are super professional and they assess each, everyone is assessed on an individual basis and then the services are, you know, provided and then channelled into where they need to be. But there's certainly a lot of crossover. Great communication. There's a team meeting every morning where, you know, the pre-start before we open the doors, you know, the teams all come together and discuss, you know, really what's the plan for today, you know? What worked yesterday? What didn't go so well? What do we need, you know? What did we do well? What can we do better? That kind of stuff. So it's a great, beautiful people. I'm really lucky to be part of it. I love it. That's great. What you've done, you know, in terms of, you know, you've done a lot of work. You said that you just finished work. Yes. What's that feeling of transition like for you, I guess, like having something that is a huge part of your life that's finished, but then also having more time to do other things? Look, I think, you know, when you finally decide that you've had enough of work, it's not an instantaneous. It's probably a slow grind the last 12 months. I was, you know, kind of feeling that I needed to, you know, exit stage right from my working career and do something else. So, you know, I'm fortunate that I can afford to do that. So, you know, then it was quite very easy for me because this is a lovely part of, you know, my life now. And I couldn't imagine not ever doing it. So, you know, I like the onboarding of new volunteers. I get involved in that. I help with Buddy Up people, you know. We're about a consistent delivery of service. So we all need to be on the same page. And it was an easy transition for me. But I've got a strong... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got a strong social background anyway with aged care, food bank, that. So I've always had that. My daughter did a lot of work with the asylum seekers in Victoria, cooking. So we're grassroots kind of people, you know. Just, you know, keep it simple. Don't confuse it. But let's get the basics right. And then we can, you know, empower people to give them the confidence. You know, a beautiful story from Orange Sky that's always stayed with me. A gentleman said, you know, I finally felt that I could sit on a bus because my clothes were so tight. My clothes were clean and people weren't going to be offended by, you know. And it gave me that sense of, okay, I can move forward. It's, you know, not always going to be this way. It might be tough now. But, you know, gradually building your self-esteem and getting that back to where you want it to be. So... Last question. Volunteering. Why, like, I guess, the power of volunteers in Australian society? Like, what sort of power do you think that the society gets in general in terms of volunteering? In terms of impact, but also for the individual? Oh, look, it's hugely satisfactory, satisfying for me. But we can't rely on the government. We can't say it's everyone else's problem. We've actually got to get out there, boots on the ground, and say, okay, I'll do the dishes. I'll do some food prep. I'll serve. You know, it's not about anything glamorous. It's just about doing the basics. And it gives me a sense of that I'm actually doing something a bit worthwhile. And I'm nothing special. But, you know, I'm doing it. If we all do a little bit, it's like anything. If we all contribute a little bit, wow, we can, you know, we can achieve a lot. And that's what it is for me. That's amazing. That's cool. Is that okay? Oh, so good. I'm just going to take a piggy now. That's all right. It's going to be... I'm actually better at taking photos than a volunteer. I am.\n",

      "Transcript": "Oh, yeah. We'll just chop and change anyway. Yeah. Hey, how are you? Hello. How's it going? Track pants? Oh, track pants are for gentlemen at the front. Oh, yeah, just at the front desk and in the computer room. Where the computers are in the big room at the front, there's some boxes with clothes. Shall I take? Yeah. Let me show you where they are. I remember meeting you last time. Okay, let's find your clothes. Okay. Hello, my name's Rita, R-I-T-A, and I'm a team leader and service coordinator for Trambi here in Perth. So just the track pants. And we're pretty busy at the moment, so I keep going a bit. This way. I think it's just in here. Yeah, we've been here for about seven years. First with the van, which has always been very, very busy. Then Trambi, Uniting WA, our service provider here, actually did a big renovation of the premises, and we're now able to actually use the... the internal laundry, which is fantastic. So very busy most of the time. I hope you don't mind, but I just got to keep doing things. Hey, Santina. There you go. Pretty good. Let me see. Hey, baby Wangle. Do you need anything for the showers? Hey. Put some of your stuff here. Hey. Oh, good. Yeah. They're all to be dried, still. Can I put these outside? I don't think so because it's... I guess it's probably too wet. ...it's raining a bit, isn't it? Yeah. Okay, we've got Melissa and Lux is going in the dryer. Cool. Okay, that's good. So this is Min over here. Hi. M-I-N. Yes, nice and short. So we started about 35 minutes ago and we basically have a pretty full afternoon again, but that's great. The difference here for Trambi is that we're doing the shift with two people because of the area restrictions. There's not that much space in here, but it works perfect. And we have a wash list as well. So people can, at the beginning when they come in at the reception of the center here, put their name down. So that works really well because it just gets too busy for us otherwise. So that's good. Tell us a bit more about Trambi. Like, is it the most Trambi? Yeah, Trambi is the most Trambi. Trambi is the most Trambi. Trambi is a, this is the Trambi hub. It's a complete service for the homeless. It provides Centrelink, street doctors, short back and sides. We are here five days a week, as I said, and we hope to be here every day of the week because we've got plenty of volunteers. So that's good. Hello. Did you get a towel? I was sitting in the angle. Do you want to be in it? I don't know. You can. You're allowed to. You're allowed to be. Why do you keep coming back to volunteer? What's the story about you? I think it's fantastic to give something back to people who are less fortunate than we are. I go home to a warm house. And I'm like, I'm going to do this. And these people here, these are really people who need all the help they can get. There's most people here that come to Trambi are rough sleepers. And it's winter. It's cold. It's just, yeah, we need to do something, don't we, to help. What's the, we talk about the word friends a lot. What does that word mean to you in terms of what you do on this tour? I don't know. I don't know. These people really mean something to us. Hello. What's your name? Hi. How are you? Good. Hello. How are you? They become friends. They, they in the beginning, maybe only acquaintances and they come in and out occasionally. But we really building up some rapport with them. And we've got some amazing stories where people finally after months and months, you know, do get some temporary accommodation. Yeah. And then move to better things. But we also have had some very sad situations where people unfortunately take their own lives. And that's been pretty traumatic. But we've got great support here. And, you know, that is unfortunately part of homelessness, isn't it? It's really, really sad. So, you know, hearing happy stories is, it's just amazing. Only last week, it was just fantastic. We, we've had a homeless person here. And fortunately, he found work again after many, many months. And it's now doing fly in, fly out. It's living in a share house. And he ended up on television because he was helping his landlord in the backyard doing some maintenance. And they were actually replacing a sewer system or something like that. And unfortunately, he got stuck in this big hole. So, it was all over Channel 7. We had, you know, the helicopter above. And I straightaway knew it was, it was him because he lives now in the area where I live. And he told me where he was. And I just had this feeling that it was him. But everything was fine. And he came in a few days later to actually tell me what had happened and to also again thank us for that. And thank us for what we've been doing for him over the, over the past month. So, that was just, that was just really lovely. Really nice. Yeah. Okay. I need to get this. What do you think it takes to be an Orange Sky volunteer? Is it a special skill or what is it? No. I think you need to be open-minded. Don't, what do you think, Min? What does it need to be an Orange Sky? Hello, I'm Remley. I'm pretty good. Hello. How are you? Pretty good. Well, pretty much. We can have a look a little bit later if we can still fit you in. Yeah. But. Yeah. I've got to wash it. Yeah. Yeah. What's the time now? I want a bra. What about tomorrow? Are you here tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. If you come early. Yeah. Then, you know, get. I definitely will. Yeah. Yeah. Get your name on the list at 7. All right. And then we can do it definitely. All right. Cool. Well, I'll check in. See you. But are you having food as well now? Because we can check. Oh, I've got a really good idea. Okay. Can you find the one on that? One. Okay. Now, next, we have our little list again. So, we're doing good. Min. Yes. Teresa not here. She's not here. No. She's not here. Yeah. She's not here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Teresa not here. No. No. No, Teresa and no Christo. Oh. Okay. Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Okay. So, then we can do. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okey-dokey. Still orange sky liquid. We just decanted a bit. Okay. That's fine. Okay. Oh, just those ones? Just a pair of my knees. We should be able to fit those in. Are they yours? We can put them in here and then we can check if you can put it in with somebody else. Okay. Okay. What was that? David Jones. David Jones? Yeah. Okay. I'll check if I can put it in with Matt. Normally we never wash together, of course. We only, if the friends agree, and I know David Jones knows Matt. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. I think that's his name. Apparently. But we know him as such. Hi. That's really funny. Yeah. Call him DJ. Matt. Amy, when did you start volunteering? I have lived and worked in the city and I just saw, I guess, timelessness was on the, you know, rapidly increasing and I just wanted to do something to help. And Orange Sky really helped me. Yeah. And Orange Sky really resonated to me. I looked up various organisations, looked at Orange Sky's website. I thought it was very informative, really like the mission, the founders. That's just seemed really progressive. And it wasn't because it's not affiliated with any, you know, religion or politics. So I'm bored. And I guess my own sake as well, like I'm in the corporate world. It's not, you know, fulfilling. I help businesses. But it's just nice to be able to help people. So yeah, I'm loving it. It's very, it's fun as well. I didn't think, I didn't know what to expect, but I love it. And yeah, I just want to do, I just want to keep doing it. Yeah. I love meeting everyone. What's it been like? How long has it been, sorry? So this is my second shift. And I guess every day, Rita's been a fantastic trainer. And it's really, and it's really, yeah. I'm glad you're here. And it's really inspiring to see Rita's connection and relationship with, you know, the staff here, but also the friends. And yeah, I've personally loved meeting everyone. It's very humbling, you know, and putting my own, I guess, ego aside and just realizing this can happen to anyone as well. So. So I'm ready to find you. Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Yeah, no worries. It'll be cool. Yeah. Awesome. So good. So, yeah, you told me that this podcast was just released for the F word, friends. Okay. How do you relate to that word as opposed to like in terms of what you do here and then your, like, friend as well, your own friend? Yeah, that's a great question. So what does friends mean? I guess equal to me. That's the first thing that comes to mind. What else? Sorry, I can't think off the top of my head. What does like friendship to you, what does it mean to friends? Right. Okay. Would be no judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. Just care for each other, respect each other, and as cliche as it sounds, treat each other how you like to be treated. And, you know, when they're in a difficult place that I like to help them and when I'm in a difficult place, I'll feel like, you know, they can help me as well. You sound like an amazing Orange Sky ambassador from, like, but you're known as being awesome, right? What would you say to other people who are thinking about volunteering but are not sure of themselves? I would say just give it a go. I guess even if you just wanted to do one shift, there's no, you know, need to commit. You can just see how it goes and, yeah, there's no pressure. You can, it's flexible in terms of, you know, the dates and your, how often you do it as well. So there's just no harm in giving it a go. So, yeah. How do you find the conversations and hanging out with your friends and stuff? What's your, how does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do this, you know, I'm going to do that. How do you find that? How does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do that? How does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do that? Hey, how are you? Just really interesting. It's just really interesting and it's just nice to have really frank conversations and I guess there's no, it's not, it's no small talk. You just kind of get into it and it's just like, yeah, no filter. Love it. Yeah. I'm not trying to be all, you know, professional or anything like that. You just, who you are and it's refreshing. Are you guys crack on? Yeah, yeah, that's true. Oh gosh. I reckon about eight, 10. Yeah. You don't need toiletries? There's a lot. I actually do more washing here than I do at home. No, you're good. My partner said I could learn a thing or two here. We've got, we've got a friend from Orange Island here. Yeah, keep hustling away. Sure. Doing a little documentary on volunteering here. You're right. Waiting for a shower. Yeah. Okay. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah, okay. And you've got the toiletries here. This is Ben. Matthew. Oh, I miss Matthew. Matthew. Do you want to be in it? Or not? No, you don't have to. No, I don't know. My dish is not, it's not good. I'll interview the... He tells me all his secrets, but you know. Oh, come on. Is it, has it got power? Yeah. Yeah. It's good, isn't it? It's good. Okay. So tell me, you have not been watching a soccer then? Well, okay. Well, if you're, when you're in the shower... The Euro. You're going to leave your... Yeah. Did you watch the Euro? Do you want to leave that here and I can watch it for you? The Euro soccer? With France and Belgium and Italy. Yeah. It's too late. It's midnight. I was really, really early. Well, look at my eyes. I was up all night watching Holland, my country. And we won. Yeah. Oh, really? We're in the semis now against England. That's going to be... We beat Turkey. Oh. Oh, my God. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry.

I could have had my sunnies on. Eh? I could have had my sunnies on. Chillax man. Yeah well, I'm not good at answering questions. That's alright. I'm very good at asking. Easy. Keep it short and simple. Don't waffle onto it all. But why do you do this? Why does Phoenix Place get involved? Well, I'm just going to say I don't know. Just say, we get involved because it's an opportunity to give back to the community. You come city. No, I mean I'm going to blow the car out. Alright, this will be too easy. It's just a yarn with me. Don't worry about showing off or doing anything wrong. I don't show off. Just your name and if you could spell it, that would be great too. Chris. C-H-R-I-S. Cool. And Chris, tell me a little bit about Phoenix first, I guess. Eh, I don't know what you want to say. What sort of, what happened this morning, I guess? Like what's your, what sort of activities and stuff do you do? This morning, the meals are cooked by our wonderful kitchen staff at Phoenix. And then staff are chosen. Staff are chosen to come and serve the people. They do their washing here, they do their laundry. They're very appreciative of all the food they have. And just talk that conversation with them. It's somewhere for them to come and discuss what's happening in their lives. And we can direct them in the right direction for extra support. Cool. How long have you been doing it for? Probably just on two years. Yeah. Wow. And what keeps bringing you back, I guess, to do this? I just feel it's an opportunity where I can give back. Like, yeah, there's a lot of people that need support and conversation. And I just take it as an opportunity to do that. And what, tell us a bit about, like have you, how long have you been in Mackay for? And tell us a little bit about like how, what sort of stuff you get up to in Mackay. I've been in Mackay on and off for about 20 years. Have family here. And, I don't know. That's cool. And like, do you, like it's a bit tough at the moment for some people. It's really like plus a living and stuff and they do it expensive. How's that impact Mackay and people in Mackay? It's a big impact. A big impact. And I see it with a lot of our participants. Groceries having doubled in the last 12 months. Their funding hasn't doubled. There's a lot of people who are in the system even and are really struggling. And that's very frustrating. Very frustrating. What do you think about Orange Sky and the stuff they do? I think they're absolutely wonderful. Lisa runs an absolutely wonderful organisation. Yeah, she gives and gives and gives. It's amazing. What do you see as the impact, I suppose, of this washing conversation? What do you think is like the most important part? I think the people that come here, they feel, they interact. And it's somewhere for them to come. They get out of their normal day-to-day life. True. Yeah, it's interesting, I guess. Like, when I used to do this stuff, I think that was the thing that was on my mind the most, right? You have this, but then what happens after, I think, is interesting. And what's like, what's the most important thing? What's future hold for you? Are you going to keep doing this? I love my job as a support worker. I love it. And I love coming here to Orange Sky. Yep. So good. Yeah. Awesome. That's it. Beautiful. Thank you. That was too easy.\n",

      "Transcript": "Tasos - Ithaca\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nUm, cool brother. Uh, just say your name and spell it. First half would be great. Okay. I'm Taso. Uh, it's spelled you just talk to me, don't worry. Okay. It's spelled T-A-S-O-S. Cool. And just tell me a little bit about like how you started. Hanging out. Um, yeah. So, uh, Ithaca for me started as a volunteer position.\n\nI started here as a volunteer photographer, uh, taking pictures of Ithaca's actions, uh, mainly of the van here. Uh, I really fell in love with what Ithaca does, helping and supporting so many people that, uh, uh, belong to homelessness, uh, that are people that, uh, live on the street, that live in adequate housing, in adequate housing.\n\nUm, and soon enough I, I get to know the members of the team and, uh, then the position opened for communications coordinator. So for me, it was the perfect opportunity. I applied and got the job two and a half years [00:01:00] back. And, uh, since then, uh, it's a nonstop growing. Both for me, for Ithaca. Uh, for me, the most important part of my work is getting Ithaca around the world to know more about Ithaca, but also learn more about, uh, homelessness in general.\n\nI. And, uh, about the housing issues that are currently affecting both Greece and Europe in general, and I believe for the whole world. Tell tell us a little bit about homelessness in, in Athens and Greece and Yeah. How, how has your understanding of it changed over, over time and you've become closer to it?\n\nYeah, so for me, when I started. Because I wasn't living in the town. I was, uh, in a rural city. Uh, I believe that homelessness was all about people living on the street. But, uh, soon enough I discovered that, uh, homelessness is not just about these people. These are the people that are living homelessness in the most rough way.[00:02:00] \n\nUh, but also homelessness is people that live in, in adequate houses, in houses without water, without, uh, electricity. Um, people that are being affected from, uh, abuse in their house. Uh, people that are being evicted every day. Here in Greece, we have, uh, such cases of people being evicted from their houses.\n\nAnd, uh, since learning all of that, since, uh, coming to in contact with the people that are experiencing all of that, my perspective changed a lot. I discovered what is really happening because in Greece there is a major issue. That we do not have actually statistics for people that belong to homelessness.\n\nWe don't know how much are those people. Uh, but also we have like the invisible homelessness that people that may have a roof above their head but are actually experiencing, eh, such difficult conditions. Wow. Um, what's the [00:03:00] main premise and what difference does a, uh, a thing like if laundry have. For people that are doing a tough, uh, so Ithaca, since the beginning, uh, has started with, uh, one goal in mind with two goals in mind, mostly.\n\nIt's, uh, getting the, um, sorry. It's improving the living conditions of homeless people by providing hygiene services. One, uh, of the most critical aspects for the homeless community that suffer often overview, uh, making this with this way. Uh, homeless people to be more connected with society, being able to have, uh, dignity and being, uh, having pride in going and talking to others.\n\nAnd through that, uh, also reintegrating them, reintegrating them, uh, into society, uh, both socially and, uh, in a work way, in a job way. Uh, [00:04:00] so if I can start as a. Mobile laundry machine, the first of its kind in Europe, and um, actually has now been developed into providing holistic support, both through psychosocial support and job counseling, managing to support overall these years more than 12,000 people.\n\nYeah. And also making, um, a new step for their future for 83 persons to find work. And start, uh, a new life. Hey, echo. You get my camera? It's over there. Um, my camera's using my bag, but, okay. Yeah, you should put the bags in the, in the van. Sorry. You should put the bag, the bags in the van. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um, and, uh, so we are here to think about what, like a global sort of washing thing, um, could look like.\n\nWhat's, what's your concept of what could happen here? A lot of people who are trying to support similar issues come together as a, as [00:05:00] a global movement. What, what, what opportunities do you think that provides? Well, I think, uh, this is an amazing opportunity to, uh, be able to support people with their hygiene, uh, needs, which is a basic necessity, uh, in a global scale, but also making this thing, uh, raising more awareness about this thing, about, uh, not only just homeless people.\n\nThat need basic access to hygiene, but also general to people that are deprived from this, uh, basic human right. Mm-hmm. So it's an amazing opportunity to get, uh, to get the word out there for more people, to learn how important it is for people. And, uh, also I think, uh, it could be a huge improvement in, uh, many people's lives, uh, and currently.\n\nIn this time that we were experiencing and the problems worse, uh, and more things I don't want to get, uh, too sad about it, [00:06:00] uh, happen all around us and many people are on the move. Many people are, uh. Are forced to leave their home, are forced to leave their families, uh, have the, should have the access to hygiene.\n\nAmazing. Um, anything else that you wanna just say or is it, uh, you are good? No. Yeah, we can keep going. Are, are you hanging with us today? Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you. Are you, are you hanging out with us today?\n\n",

      "Transcript": "**Speaker 6 is David**\nSpeaker 4: I prefer to speak in Spanish. I have a hard time with English, but I can translate that part.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you talk about when they first came here?\nSpeaker 6: The first time you entered, you almost didn't enter.\nSpeaker 4: When you were here the first time, first day, when did they start coming? What did they do? When I adapted a little, it was good, I felt welcomed. Then at home I was fine, I mean, when my family came to see me, I felt good, welcomed, like it was a home, more or less. Then when you leave, adapting to various homes is more, even more - there's TV, TV, MP3 player, it's quite good, at least in this center. And there in Australia, how is the food? How is it?\nSpeaker 2: What is the best? It's very different from cuisine all over the world. Of course there in the centers it's very basic. In the centers the food is very basic.\nSpeaker 6: The food is normally not made on site, but they bring it in like takeout. But in the closed centers, right, they don't have food like us, made in the kitchen and such. Just reheated food. In the hospital too.\nSpeaker 3: This is from the hospital, something similar, they heat it up in a microwave and give it to you. Prison food, so good, more or less good. Well, more or less let's say. And yesterday.\nSpeaker 6: And yesterday in England, what are the centers like?\nSpeaker 1: Very similar to Australia.\nSpeaker 6: The problem that both Australia and England have is that they are too similar, so they don't treat the kids who are there well. They don't treat the kids well.\nSpeaker 7: No, no, they treat them very well. And in Ireland, how is it?\nSpeaker 6: In Ireland. I'm half Irish, although no, me too. From the north or south? From the north. In Ireland, in Belfast, where I was also in a center, it's very similar? Yes, because everything Anglo-Saxon, everything English-speaking - United States, Australia, UK - they are all like prisons. Ah, very strict.\nSpeaker 4: Very strict. They treat them as if it were a prison, but for children. This is actually a re-education center that they now call a residence, and everything has changed here. It wasn't like this before, because my sister was in Reyes 15 years ago when it was run by Fundación Diagrama and she says things have changed a lot.\nSpeaker 6: I tell you that you said it very well when it was Fundación Diagrama. And she says that things have changed a lot. Well, I tell you that they behaved very well. You said it very well. This is designed to re-educate and prevent recidivism when they go outside. The other is more to punish. The other is more punishment, punishment, punishment. In Australia, in England, in the United States - to punish.\nSpeaker 3: David, tell me - what you're saying is to punish, yes, but that's how you learn not to re-enter these places again? Do you think you would learn more if they treat you badly?\nSpeaker 6: No, no, things are stricter?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, well, stricter means they treat you badly, no.\nSpeaker 6: Things are stricter. Yes, well, stricter means they treat you badly, they don't feed you well, you don't leave your room for 23 hours any day. You don't do an hour of sports, if you can. You don't go to school. And the only thing you do is stay in your room for 23 hours so you don't fight with anyone outside and they don't teach you anything.\nSpeaker 4: There are no studies, they simply don't exist.\nSpeaker 6: If you want, yes, if you don't want, no. In other words, would you learn?\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 5: They would stop you more, I think, there is an educator for every twenty. In other words, it's like a prison, but for children. They are not going to, there is no educator.\nSpeaker 4: There is no re-education project or anything like that.\nSpeaker 6: There is no re-education project. So what you're telling me, what I understand, is how they treat you here, but with stricter rules, so that you learn more not to want to be here, because here you are actually so comfortable that it's not bad enough to come back again, of course, let's see if we compare the children from Australia?\nSpeaker 4: Surely, yes, if we compare, if they came here, they would say \"oh my god\", they would say \"this is a home\". They would say it's a house all day long with more kids. There is an educator who supports you if you are feeling down emotionally. They help you on many levels. Here is an example, this is observation.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, yes, normally you are here, those who are not yet ready to be in the yard. Yes, of course, and finally you are there, those who are not yet ready to be in the yard. Yes, of course, okay, there are four of you. How many security personnel are inside here right now?\nSpeaker 4: None.\nSpeaker 6: Okay, how many in observation, which is the first step, when they come and can't be with the rest. How many security personnel are there with four people? Ah, four? Four, four. Security here. None. Why? Because it's mutual. We trust you, we know you, whether you want to or not, it's different.\nSpeaker 4: And outside there would be more. But you are educators and outside there were more, but you are educators. No, no you are an educator, I mean educator, not a person who is there. There you can see kids, no, he doesn't work in the center, but no, he doesn't work in the center. But he is from Fundación Diagrama.\nSpeaker 6: He is not from Fundación Diagrama, he tries... He tries to push for change in his country. So there are a lot of people. Benjamin has many friends, colleagues who are, it's like a movement to change the treatment of children in centers and do things like this, where you are comfortable, you learn, and it's not about punishing, punishing, punishing, because if you are in the room, as you said, you go crazy in truth.\nSpeaker 4: Of course, if you are in the room, as you said, you go crazy. In truth, for me, in my opinion, being in the room would be the worst, because many hours thinking, mulling it over in your mind, many hours there thinking, thinking, thinking, you don't have permission, you don't have... And the center with the most privileges, what is it like?\nSpeaker 6: What is the unit in Australia with more privileges?\nSpeaker 2: They are all the same. No, ah, pretty much all the same. Ehm, privilege in Australia is more TV, snack food and that's about it.\nSpeaker 6: There's no other privilege for outside, to get things, anything else for all the units, because there they are units, not homes. All the units are more or less the same and the only privileges you can have are more hours of television or junk food, I mean?\nSpeaker 4: Well, I misunderstood, food, snacks as they call them, but normally it's bags of potato chips, that kind of thing.\nSpeaker 6: There's no privilege to go outside.\nSpeaker 4: There's no privilege to do more activities or have more freedom to choose what you want to do or go water plants on your own, but I guess it's because the offenses committed by the minors are more serious. Or not? It's not that, right?\nSpeaker 6: Are you saying that maybe it's because the children, their crimes are more serious than the women?\nSpeaker 2: No. It's the same, the same.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I'm a kid, but I think, like there's more segregation.\nSpeaker 2: So with if there's 30 kids, there'll be five different groups. And they are split up by their offending. And I think that increases the possibility of disconnection. And they are divided by those who are offending and I think that increases the disconnection or increases the conflict that can occur between them, because there is a status and a rank, a rank of offenders.\nSpeaker 6: What he explained is that there is more segregation there. The kids are in units, depending on the crime they have committed.\nSpeaker 1: Ahhhh.\nSpeaker 6: To maintain the status of \"I'm more dangerous than\", well, then what there are, are fights. I'm more than you, you're more than me, because they're all in the same.\nSpeaker 4: And one question. There, can you buy food, like here in Spain, like in a Spanish prison, for example.\nSpeaker 1: The commissary.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, junk food, food, food, right, like junk food things like a canteen? Yes, and there you can ask any question, right, more or less, you can play there or there is still search when you go back to your room.\nSpeaker 6: It doesn't seem like it.\nSpeaker 3: I don't know, I'm going to go.\nSpeaker 4: Something they can bring in.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, they may try to bring something in, or the family or whatever, but you really can't. I thought about it because I say that, as it used to be allowed here in Spain before. Yes, when we all started working, we had a lighter and we had to give fire to them.\nSpeaker 5: And you had a pack every two days, especially.\nSpeaker 4: Every two days.\nSpeaker 6: And I smelled, when I went to my house, like I had been in a nightclub. And if you misbehaved they would cut your hair, indeed.\nSpeaker 4: That's why, that's why I said it, but that was already 20 years ago.\nSpeaker 3: And David, if you are in the room, that you don't leave, you go crazy in the room. They restrain you, they restrain you, they restrain you, but they restrain you just like here. Or more people, 5 or 6 people. Stronger. They hurt you. Of course, then, not anymore.\nSpeaker 4: And there they don't, they don't play the games, neither play, I mean play, they don't play games, I mean they play but no, it's a room. They don't play group games.\nSpeaker 6: It may be a one-player game, no, no, there really aren't workshops or anything like that.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, a little, but it's not very organized. It's not a little, but it's not very organized, it's not very organized, it's more risk.\nSpeaker 4: Everything is at risk, it's simply going for a measure and that's it. Have you been here in gardening workshops? Have you done it?\nSpeaker 6: Gardening, not me, but yes. Or masonry, well, here you have, you have all kinds of materials that you can find on the street, but if you are focused on safety they will not let you. But because they are scared, we trust, we trust you. And if you learn it, there, as everything is no, no, no, just in case they do something, well, they don't give you any material. Oh my god, so many things you can do like that to paint, color things that you can't hurt the kid, or hurt anyone.\nSpeaker 4: So, imagine how much it reduces what you can do.\nSpeaker 6: Because they are very afraid, right? They are afraid that something will happen? They don't trust people, and that affects many. And so, what's the point of serving?\nSpeaker 5: A measure?\nSpeaker 4: When yes, to punish, that's it. Of course. But here too, when you do something wrong, there are consequences, they punish you, but they don't deprive you of, for example, as he said, they don't deprive you of the right to education. Totally. They don't deprive you of the right to.\nSpeaker 1: That's what he wants to change.\nSpeaker 4: I would change education, for example. I really like since I entered to focus on studies, they could change their way of life. Explain it to him, I mean. They come in for an offense, they regret it and like they want to change? You know, they want to be something tomorrow, they want to be able to. You understand me. Oh I understand perfectly.\nSpeaker 6: That. You want a translation?\nSpeaker 2: He took a bit of education and life after.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, he needed to give some advice to Australia. Your education is very important. Since he has been here, he wants to do vocational training at different levels, because you can commit a problem, but you can learn from it and redeem yourself from what you have done, but you need a future when you go from here. And that's what he was talking about.\nSpeaker 2: In fact I was going to ask that question. What would you say to Australia?\nSpeaker 3: David, there in Australia is the center more like a prison, more fenced.\nSpeaker 6: More fenced. They have concertina wire. But it's the one outside, the asylum one, prison, well they have concertina wire. And I understand they have three security baths. That's in Australia there are three doors and they all have a guard. That's how they are, and all this is a prison.\nSpeaker 1: Normally it is used so that you see, normally it is used.\nSpeaker 6: Imagine that this was a prison formerly. Let's see a prison here and there was a unit here before. Okay? What they do is they put a fence here, and now they make this for minors, I mean it was an adult prison formerly, normally it's observation, I don't know why.\nSpeaker 3: So it's an adult prison but... And if you try, I don't know, you bring in tobacco, things, whatever you want, they catch you. Well, they can give you more time, so what?\nSpeaker 2: What happens in Australia is the kids get on the roof and they protest. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: That happens a lot. What happens in Australia is that the kids get on the roof and protest.\nSpeaker 3: One time they arrived and asked for pizza and they had to take it and give it to them, and they are only on the roofs?\nSpeaker 2: Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!\nSpeaker 3: Food.\nSpeaker 6: Food.\nSpeaker 4: Food.\nSpeaker 6: But they don't hit them, right.\nSpeaker 4: They don't hit them there, they don't hit them.\nSpeaker 6: They shouldn't, it happens from time to time, but they shouldn't hit them, of course. Of course, as here in Spain it's very...\nSpeaker 2: No, those kids would have gone into seclusion for a few days. So like in a room for them. Those kids who got up there.\nSpeaker 6: They would put them in their room without being able to leave for around 4 or 5 weeks. They could go out for an hour or two days, but they would be outside.\nSpeaker 3: But, David, if they know they are going to be in the room, and that, and they get on the roof, why don't they try? They can't do anything? Why to an adult prison? Of course, you have a fence that is 5000 meters and they can't do anything?\nSpeaker 6: Why, to an adult prison, you have a fence that measures 5.5 or 6?\nSpeaker 3: Meters. I don't know, if you're not going to leave the room.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, but they have that need in that moment. That when you deprive the kids of so many things and they have so little interaction with the staff, in the end they need to claim anything.\nSpeaker 3: So they do whatever, with anything, I mean when they put us in the rooms we are there for 20 minutes and that's it.\nSpeaker 6: And I get stressed. The most important thing about being in a center is to be as active as possible.\nSpeaker 1: Do as much as possible.\nSpeaker 6: More sports than anyone, more workshops than anyone else. Sometimes it's more boring because you don't want to take that class or whatever, but the most important thing... Time goes by faster the more your head is working. I mean here in the room, it makes life eternal for you.\nSpeaker 4: There they don't give you the opportunity to be able to change how you are, as for example, here, here they give you an opportunity in this center, for example a few, here they give you an opportunity in this center, for example a few, to be able to change again, I mean how you are, in the sense that there are children who need time to be able to improve on a personal level and they need to give it to them and they need to give them a minimum of trust so that they, of course, also give if you give and he gives, well there, you understand me, right? Then there is trust, then you go up blocks. But if that doesn't happen to a child, in the end I think I\nSpeaker 4: ...if they put me there. Of course, in the end you don't choose where you live, you don't choose where you are born, you don't choose who you are, or what you feel, or anything. In the end they don't let you have a second chance in life.\nSpeaker 6: Many things you think that everyone makes mistakes?\nSpeaker 4: Of course, of course I do, I've made more mistakes than you.\nSpeaker 6: I'm older than you, so I've had more time to make mistakes. But the important thing is not making mistakes or not making mistakes. The important thing is to learn that you were wrong. Of course, to think \"oops, I was wrong and I'm not going to do it again\". Don't think that you made a mistake by being here. There is no one in the world who has not made a mistake once.\nSpeaker 4: But with a heavy hand, it's not always \"come on, I lock you in the room so you don't do it again\". Surely they won't do it again. That's not how you learn. I don't think that's how you learn.\nSpeaker 6: You have to have time to think about what you have done. You have to have time. In four weeks you know that you don't have to get on a roof.\nSpeaker 4: There are no psychologists there.\nSpeaker 2: There are no psychologists there. There are no psychologists. Yes, but maybe two in a center. Yes, a center for meetings and breaks.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, there are around two per center, but they have more meetings, more paperwork and less talking to people.\nSpeaker 3: And if you are in the highest unit there, they are all similar, you already have TV and that. You don't want to go back anymore. You understand me, going back is almost everything, but you don't want to go back anymore. But you're going to do it because you're crazy there.\nSpeaker 6: I think that nobody wants to have a bad time in a place. So, if they treat you badly and you are having a bad time in a place, I always think that it is violence after violence. If you treat someone badly, what you are going to get back is that they are going to treat you badly too. It's not the same. An educator who arrives and gives you a hug and everything else, well, you are going to be fond of that educator, of course. Of course. If the educator is the one who is poking you, understand me when I say not talking to you, the reaction, when you see him, is going to be totally different. So that's what's happening there, more than that, well, they're doing it wrong. In terms of putting everyone in the same, I don't know, and not giving them incentive, it's not worth the second chance that you're talking about, second, third, fourth, fifth, whatever it takes.\nSpeaker 4: What do you think?\nSpeaker 3: That's for me, I think.\nSpeaker 6: So we are going to try to change something there, right, and the communications there.\nSpeaker 4: Hi mom, I haven't put anything, it's fine, now it's your turn to talk about yourselves. Now it's your turn to talk about yourselves. Now it's your turn to talk about yourselves. Now it's your turn to talk about yourselves.\nSpeaker 1: Now it's your turn to talk about yourselves. Now it's your turn to talk about yourselves. Australia is mind-blowing, really.\nSpeaker 3: Australia is mind-blowing, really. Australia is mind-blowing, really, the landscape, the south and such. Australia is wonderful. Before he came I was telling the educator what it was like to live in Australia.\nSpeaker 6: Well, it's worth it. If you have the opportunity, don't step foot in the center, unless it's to work and change the situation there.\nSpeaker 3: But the country is wonderful. And the staff, for example, don't get along with the kids. There's nothing, no communication, zero.\nSpeaker 2: You think that, how about going to Australia, sorry, ah why don't you come to Australia?\nSpeaker 6: Is that what he says. He said he would like to go to Australia. Yes, and now he is asking about the relationship between security and the adult. Do you think, do you know what an adult prison is like inside? Yes, but not to talk. Do you know what an adult prison is like inside even if it's from the movies? Yes, okay. Well, they normally have a... What's it called? Like a wing and in the middle they have like a fishbowl where they are inside, with glass and such. It's a big yard where people, if they want something, they come close and such, through the glass, they ask for whatever and they give it to them under a door. There in Australia.\nSpeaker 3: How? Yes, in Australia yes.\nSpeaker 6: Is that how it is? So there is no contact, there is no... The only thing that opens is the door. They tell you to shower. Where I went, the shower was in the yard.\nSpeaker 3: But for example in observation, what do we shower by protocol, one by one there?\nSpeaker 6: Nothing. Everyone. There in the street for everyone to see, to see everyone, of course, without a curtain. Yes, yes, more security, because normally there is usually no more than one or two, every one or two, but they shower outside without a curtain and they are looking after you, of course, in case you go crazy?\nSpeaker 3: No, of course, for what may happen. And if you are there and you say \"I'm going to be\", it's a thought. You say \"I'm going to be in the room I don't know how many hours\", and you're going to do something to me. And you're going to, for example, do something to me and you go to the hospital, they have a hospital inside.\nSpeaker 6: Ah, so nothing. They have...\nSpeaker 3: It has a hospital and doctors, nurses, they have the whole hospital inside itself. I haven't laid down, of course. Yes, no.\nSpeaker 5: I don't understand. Because of the difficulty of climbing on the roofs for a pizza? Why?\nSpeaker 3: In the end. Well yes, really. Yes, the food here is good, really. It's good, only that... That you don't like the vegetables that are missing, it's not good I swear I like it, but we need more food.\nSpeaker 5: What not hunger is... Really? Are you one of those who eats the whole plate in the shower?\nSpeaker 3: The shower is good, yes, even if you like the stew. But the one that is not good, the spinach.\nSpeaker 6: But the spinach.\nSpeaker 5: He may like everything. The one you don't like you said.\nSpeaker 3: Spinach. When I was your age I didn't like it.\nSpeaker 6: I started to like it more.\nSpeaker 5: And I didn't like mushrooms either, neither the thistle for the mushrooms and such, but then you eat a lot.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, yes, because here the plates are... There is more hunger really. I have been in other centers and in other centers they don't eat as much as here. Here the plates are overflowing, I would starve to death, I would die.\nSpeaker 5: Come on, here, we have plates of beans with rice or lentils that they eat everything. It's fine.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\nSpeaker 5: Well, that's where you put it, man.\nSpeaker 6: It will grow, don't worry.\nSpeaker 3: I will grow. There is time. But something tall not wide. Right. And there the exercise. Do you go out somewhere?\nSpeaker 6: Exercise, as it is normally by contact. I mean, if you play soccer, if you play there, the national sport is rugby, rugby goes. Well, imagine if it is by contact. Try that people don't come back.\nSpeaker 3: But I mean, for example, push-ups, all that, they don't do it? In the room? Not very organized?\nSpeaker 6: Exercise is not very well organized. It's what each one wants and wants.\nSpeaker 2: We can tell you that there is a program, that I am working with a man who worked 11 years in prison and went out to work in the center and now he is working in a personal training program, so it is very organized and focused on training people.\nSpeaker 4: Crossfit is something they have like a coach.\nSpeaker 6: A program that they have just started, which is separate from the prison, but they are helping. It's like someone who comes from outside. It's not the prison, it's not the workers and never, never, never security. They are not going to play anything, I mean, they are not going to have an educator playing soccer with you or whatever, you can't talk to security but they are not going to pay much attention to you. If some speak good, others speak bad, and like everything. And can you have material in the room there?\nSpeaker 4: Material? Eh... Aten or...\nSpeaker 2: Every time you get something, you make sure they get it. They don't interrupt. It's very, it's very, it's very... It's very.\nSpeaker 6: It's very, it's, very, it's very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very, it's, very, it's, very... It's, very... It's very... It's, very... It's very... It's, very, it's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's, very... It's very strict.\nSpeaker 4: It's very strict. Come on, like the prisons in the United States. I've seen reports of... There is a type of people that if the kids misbehave, they send them to see what the prisons are like and they go dressed in an orange suit, that in the United States. In the United States.\nSpeaker 6: They do it? I went to see a center in the United States, Washington. I think. And everyone has a uniform jumpsuit with a tracksuit. No no no.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, cool.\nSpeaker 6: And well, what strikes me the most is that, if you went from here to the dining room you would all go with slippers on your feet.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, yes, well, yes, it's true.\nSpeaker 5: So, like going up to the roof... They hoist... In Australia the slippers on the roof.\nSpeaker 3: I do like them.\nSpeaker 6: If that's the other one... Each one has a different color. And they are all with the same. He says that there even the children... The children do wear uniforms, but each place has different colors to know where they are going. I mean, it's each crime.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, if you, for example, are in for murder, they put you with people who have killed. If you are in for stealing, they put you with people who have stolen. And there are no women? Yes, but separate. You are separate, yes, yes. You can't mix? No, I'm normal.\nSpeaker 6: Come on, it seems... Not even before it was like that. A little bit. Not even before it was like that, not even before it was like that. There are very few girls.\nSpeaker 4: Well, here there are also very few. I have read, because here there is like a dossier and there is another dossier that is one from 2006. I have read it and it seems to be from Fundación Diagrama and all the everything it has and not even in 2006, which was a long time ago, 20 years ago. It seems that it seems so strict, it seems very strict, that there in Australia. Yes, it seems that if the children, of course, I understand, I would understand the children, because if you don't give the children an opportunity to be able to change them, well in the end from being in the room so much, from not being able to do anything, they go crazy, they say \"what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?\"\nSpeaker 6: And that is not the solution in this world, inside the centers and such, there are two philosophies, one that is rehabilitative, educational and such. There are two philosophies. One that is rehabilitative, educational and such and another that is to punish. There are only two, there is no other, and some countries like one more and some countries like the other more. And what you want to do there in Australia is change it?\nSpeaker 4: No, the government changes all that?\nSpeaker 6: That the government goes from being punitive to educational. You have to think that I haven't said this before that the minimum age to enter a center is 10 years old, ah! 10 years old? And up to how much? 18? 18?\nSpeaker 4: But how are you going to be with people? How are you going to be with people? Imagine an 18-year-old boy with a 10-year-old boy, well, here you are, a 14-year-old with a 23-year-old but a 10-year-old boy is a small child and there are rapes or something?\nSpeaker 7: What? There are rapes or something inside?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, but they can't get out like that, they can't...\nSpeaker 2: No, not much. It's not that there are... There are young people who... Eh...\nSpeaker 1: Hateful sex? Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. There is sex... sex? Between them?\nSpeaker 4: He says that a bit for me is a problem, he says that a long time ago yes, it was bad but I say it because of course it is not the same stating an 18-year-old boy, well, an adult, more or less a 18-year-old boy than a 10-year-old boy. They don't have the same strength, nor the same mentality, nor the same maturity. So the 18-year-old can take advantage of the 10-year-old, being in the same unit. But no, I mean sexually, I say at all levels, in any way.\nSpeaker 6: What, bullying for?\nSpeaker 4: Example, yes for example those things, or that they force him, for example, to hide food and then give it to him, or things I don't know, yes, no, it can't happen.\nSpeaker 3: If you are ten years old you are a baby, you are little. When you are ten years old you are a small child.\nSpeaker 4: That they should change. They would have to put it like... With 14 you already have more or less a little bit of...\nSpeaker 1: Of something that is good in bed, you know?\nSpeaker 4: But with 10, with 10 more or less, you are little? I remember that at 10 I didn't know what I was doing, but at the same time I did silly things, you know, and the parents know, that their child is going to go there in the end.\nSpeaker 3: Because no... Some come here? right, that they move to Spain? For example, if a 10-year-old boy is going to go in there, well, look, it's not a bad option.\nSpeaker 6: He asks... The solution... Is like why do the parents know that the children are 10 years old and can go into custody? Why don't they move from Australia...\nSpeaker 3: In Australia there is money. More than here, or not?\nSpeaker 4: That's why. Well, but then... In Australia there is money. More than here or not, yes. In...\nSpeaker 2: Australia there is more money.\nSpeaker 3: That's why. Well, but then... It's very.\nSpeaker 4: But then... But that, money doesn't fix it, but those families are not the wealthiest.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, of course. Those families are not the ones who are going to have the money. And can you pay bail there?\nSpeaker 4: Is there bail? Can you?\nSpeaker 6: Pay for the children's ticket? No, no.\nSpeaker 2: No no. Are they at the police station?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. And what do you think about the fact that kids here in Spain can continue after 18 in a center like this? And they don't go?\nSpeaker 3: To prison. Well, it depends on what you have done. I think.\nSpeaker 1: More or less.\nSpeaker 4: And it also depends on the maturity you have, because I have met in other Fundación Diagrama protection centers, I have met 18-year-old people who if they don't have the maturity to be in prison, well maybe the judge turns a blind eye.\nSpeaker 5: But it also depends on the maturity you have on a personal level, but would you personally like to be given the opportunity to continue in a center like this when you turn 18, did you think they would give you the opportunity to continue in a center like this when you turn 18?\nSpeaker 4: I would, yes, of course. Of course I would. It's not like the... And you Eitan? I of course, but because in prison?\nOf course, I'll continue the translation from where I left off:\nSpeaker 3: In prison I would be a kid, you understand me?\nSpeaker 7: But at 18.\nSpeaker 5: Imagine that you turn 18 here inside, I don't know.\nSpeaker 3: No, it's really not for me, but the kids who are 14 years old, for example, I don't know.\nSpeaker 4: Let's see in prison. They have more freedom because in prison you have the canteen. In prison there isn't an educator behind you telling you what to do. No, there is a schedule in prison. There are stabbings, there is I don't know what, I don't know how much, I don't know what, there is in the \"cabón\" [slang term].\nSpeaker 3: Well, that's in intimate visits. I don't know how much. That's in intimate visits. In prisons there aren't those things.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, they do hit each other, but... I have seen interviews.\nSpeaker 6: It's very similar to what we were talking about in Australia, because right now there is more freedom. Look, you can guide it at the same time, so you could a roof, but it really doesn't have the same structure, it doesn't have... The people who care about you. There can be 60 people in a unit, there can be 100 people in a unit. So my opinion is that, if you are doing well, if you are doing well in your educational project, going as an adult to prison is breaking the progress you are making now.\nIf you are here your educational project, carrying it out, well, going as an adult to prison is breaking the progress you are making now, if you are here messing around, that you are not taking advantage of the opportunity to be here because in the end it is an opportunity that they give you.\nSpeaker 4: It's a prison opportunity.\nSpeaker 6: I don't know if you have ever visited someone, but prison is tough and so much. I don't know if you have ever visited someone or whatever, but it's a tough month and so much more the ones here, in Spain.\nSpeaker 4: I compare one with, for example, the one in Brazil, the one in Argentina, the one in Colombia, the one in the United States.\nSpeaker 3: From here you can see the lights of Villena. From here. From here you can see, but from the yard. Didn't you know you were? There it is. They don't fight us, right?\nSpeaker 4: Surely. That's why. And it's better not to step into prison, to have an education, not to be able to have rights that here, of course, are basic for a lifetime, are to go out, to be able to be in a group with more people, such. There you are in the room all day. In the end you go crazy. I would prefer to go to a psychiatric hospital before being here, no, not anymore. Time goes slower?\nSpeaker 6: No, I would be scared. You have been here for a while. How long have you been here?\nSpeaker 3: I've been here for two months.\nSpeaker 6: I've been here for three months, three? Three? Three weeks, three weeks. Well, imagine that for me the most important thing about the centers that we run and are visiting and such, is the tranquility that you have, that you don't have to be worried about your safety. That's what he said at the beginning, when not before. Now it's calm, it's not that I would study, that it's accepted, that if I don't know if the colleague or the worker is going to hit you, this could not be focused on the letters.\nSpeaker 4: But here you don't know if a colleague either. No, it's not the same, but you feel safe. Or do you feel that you are in danger all the time?\nSpeaker 1: No, because there is a player who supervises the one who...\nSpeaker 4: But there is for example a guard, four guards maybe. They give one a slap, another one a punch, and he says \"ah, well, a punch\".\nSpeaker 6: And he says \"ah, look, well, I let it go\". For me that's extremely important, to be able to focus on studying, on playing, on going outside, on visiting, on family, on whatever you want to do. The most important thing is that you are calm and that you are not afraid of what might happen to you.\nSpeaker 7: Of course, I, after a year, I had never considered being an educator, but coming here I consider it because it makes your measure more bearable, more of a person to talk to. Not to be alone and with people who are worth it, you know?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I encourage you because I think that people who have been inside and who have been here, and then have gotten their degree and you can't imagine how much that can help other kids. That when they come they tell you that they are having a bad time and you tell them but I have also been here.\nThat has a strength that you don't see, and those of us who have been here, notice that we have territorial directors, educators. The most beautiful job that you, and we have been for years, the job that we have liked the most of all and we have responsibility, has been that of educators, of being there. Well, when you are having a bad time or you are having a bad time, well you are there and you try to help each other. And we go home. And there's no need to get there to not think. No, you're not thinking all the time, how can I do it? Because we care?\nSpeaker 4: My sister was there in Reyes, they took her. She behaved so, so, so well that they took her some awards to Valencia. And then she wanted to reconsider being an Educator. Because she entered, she got her studies, she left with her studies and now she is not an Educator. But now she is 27 years old and she is an esthetician and she is super good. And coordinators from here have seen her here. Yes, coordinators have seen her and they haven't recognized her.\nSpeaker 6: I know people who have been inside, many minors. I know of cases of coming to work later, but maybe as maintenance or something. I don't follow up on everyone we have worked with, but it is true that there are people who have worked in maintenance and have stayed. It is getting more and more difficult to be an educator in a degree.\nBefore it was any degree, now you have to be a social educator. Hey, they are more than prepared to be social educators, that is not the most difficult thing in the world. But I'm telling you, I encourage you to do it. Social worker, social educator, anything. To be an educator. Right now the problem I see is that before all degrees could be and now only social educator.\nSpeaker 3: A social integrator which is a superior.\nSpeaker 6: Also. So, what can I tell you? Do you have a question?\nSpeaker 3: I'm here. There was a question here from Australia.\nSpeaker 4: So I would say, to change that in the centers, education, and that instead of being all the time... And personal relationships? And personal relationships, of course, and also the measure years with 10 years. Of course, with 10 years it's a pity.\nWhat are you going to do at 10 years old in a center, because I see myself at 10 years old in a juvenile center and it makes you when I was little and I say oh my god, then compared to being together with an 18-year-old, well, you have to mature before, you have to become more responsible before, because if you are in a room all day, alone there, thinking as if that were the worst, well you are bad all day we have a bad time.\nSpeaker 7: My problem here is going to be my head.\nSpeaker 6: They think, think, think, and being here extracts me and you don't talk to people, that's the best thing to make it go by quickly. The measure is to occupy your head. The more activities and things you do, the better because time flies by. When you're there.\nSpeaker 7: If you're doing nothing, the days go by, we're talking about weeks, and those who have mental problems who medicate them to the point there or what? There? Yes. Those who have mental problems have too much medication, Oh many.\nSpeaker 2: In Australia it's faster.\nSpeaker 4: What they do is over-medicate people, especially if there is any mental disability and such. And if they have a mental disability or something like that, they don't take you to another center?\nSpeaker 7: No, it's going to be the same. And if you are in?\nSpeaker 6: Helplessness it will be the same. Helplessness? That he doesn't have?\nSpeaker 4: The custody is... The majority.\nSpeaker 6: This is another thing, the majority of children I think it's 25%. 25% of the children who are in the center have no crime, but they basically have no family. So they put them in prison?\nSpeaker 7: Because the orphanages are full?\nSpeaker 6: Because the orphanages are practically not. As they are homeless, well they put them there. And there. What they do is they go crazy and they start to be violent. Someone who was not violent, they start to get worse, but that... They get worse.\nSpeaker 4: Well, all that is what we are going to change there?\nSpeaker 6: Well yes, what happens Letter? That yes summarizes. We are going to change there, well yes. That's the summary.\nSpeaker 3: No, I haven't heard it, but I'm looking for the one from Australia.\nSpeaker 6: Well, boys, a pleasure to meet everyone. And thanks for everything. Good luck. I hope that...\n",

      "Transcript": "Right down the end there, see where that big car is? That's the sewed up centre. So more or less we're sort of spread right down here and all over here. Cool. You've got to keep moving in this weather. Keep moving. I know. How long have you been around with Beaker? Has it been around a long time? It's been a while. Cool. I was in the season of January 2002. Yeah, right. And I was much different back then. Everything was just in that one building. Yeah. And then we had the health programs. And is it primarily government that funds the mines a bit too? Yes, we get from multiple different governments. True. So we've got Department of Health which pretty much funds the clinic. And then we've got so many other programs and they're all funded by different government bodies and organisations. One of the tricky bits is to try and bring it all together. Yep. In a way that you're doing the best for the time. Yeah. Yeah, I spent a long time in Mount Isa. It's a different sort of concept but some similarities of community, and like, especially the distance and the different people coming to our central place. So that's where we run the social and emotional wellbeing at the moment. Cool. We've had a few schools, two don't have the back to accommodation. We're everywhere. Yeah. Taking over the streets. Thank you for the . I've got a proposal in with council. Morning. Morning. I've seen these things everywhere too. They're like eye scanners, yeah? Yeah. It's just, we've had a lot of stuff like that. Mm-hmm. Show you why it takes you home. Nice doors. It's fine. I'm loving it. Yeah. Yeah, it does. It's like the TARDIS. Right. Hello. Hello. No, I haven't seen it. It's a bit of a new thing. I'm not sure what it is. It's a little bit like a desk. A desk and a desk and a desk and desk and a desk and a desk and a desk and a desk and a No, I haven't seen it. I left at about nine o'clock so I might have missed it. But yeah, there was all the fellas out there trying to get me to buy them a tarp for the house out there because they were all getting wet. So see we've bought a camp because they're sort of like from the Dundasetta area. But the council and shire, they sort of like get funded for it to make sure it's maintained and everything. But they're eventually going to be moving that. Because you can see that big mine. So they'll be moving it closer to where Boulder Shore Stay is, behind somewhere. So we don't try and encourage people to live there. We try and have it like a, when they come in for a couple of nights, stay there. But because of the history they love that area. And then we try and get them to Boulder Shore Stay. Alright, I'm going to stop up to that. So the spears are cool. Yeah they are. It's my bane of my existence logging into stuff. Alright, let's break. Break my mind. I get it. Security and everything. Yeah. Maybe so often you've got to change your password. Yeah. I've just got used to it. I've just remembered that. Yeah, brother. So Anna's around today? Yeah, she's at the moment because they're sort of supporting with, um, oh you're not here next week are you? No. I've got to leave tomorrow. Yeah. So, because they made it a week bigger, sort of, um, there's some programs with us. So we do always, we do an elders lunch. And it started off small but we're just like, we were, there's so many elders sort of, I'm like where's all these oldies coming from? It's like we've been hyping up for years. Sure. And now they're just everywhere. Well they enjoy it so. Yeah. We've got the ball, the youth ball. That's a sort of big thing. Cool. Um, and we were on the march. We all met up at the march. We all met up at the park down there. So all ages and everything. Police, everyone's name is all there. And then we have like the guest speakers and then just providing stuff and information. Put a barbecue on. So apparently they've got the, um, Yabba band on the opening day. So that talk is already out now. Yeah. Awesome. Sorry Phil. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Phil's calling me. This was modified slightly to start with. Cool. Brother. It's Ben. Hey, did you catch up with the blog? Yeah. I'm in Bega now. Oh, all right. Yeah. Where are you going? Ah, true. I'm in Bega now. Oh, yeah. We're in Bega. Yeah, I saw Trace, yeah. Yeah, I'm going to do a little few videos and stuff. I'll probably be a few more hours now, so let me know if you're going to leave. Yeah, yeah, going to see Anna next, yeah. Awesome. Thanks, brother. Stay warm, yeah? See you, brother. All righty. So basically we last year celebrated our 40th anniversary. It's Aboriginal community control, because there was some people saying things about, oh, you know, communities aren't involved, or communities, because they run the place, they own it. And always acknowledge traditional owners and builders as an element. We have a board, which the board is the board of the Aboriginal community. So we have a board, which the board is the board of the Aboriginal community. So the board is basically called from a membership base. In order to be a member of the organisation, you have to be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person residing in the goldfields. The goldfields region goes from Eskimos Drive to Nemo or Laverton and beyond. So it's an area three times the size of Victoria, twice the size of Newcastle. So that's what we do. And then we'd like any organisation, we'd have a vision, vision statement, which the one sort of matter is the why, and why are we having it? Yeah. And then the mission, which then describes what we do in order to try and achieve the vision. We focus on some key areas there, sustainable, culturally appropriate, holistic, health care, holistic, as in the whole person, not the new age sort of holistic helping. We look at the whole person, which includes your social determinants, like health. There's no use patching somebody up in the clinic and going back to an environment where they just haven't been. And then workforce is the other one. An ongoing challenge for us here is always making sure we've got the workforce we need. So we have a non-site registered training organisation that trains Aboriginal health practitioners and then we bring them into the workforce once they graduate. So, and this was just to get staff thinking about, you know, a matter of lifetime, I'll do some training with this, what is big is why. You've got your vision, your mission, but condense it. Why is bigger here? Well, that's why big is here. Now, those are all the sort of functional or different areas that we have, different programs, I think. And I was just trying to show staff that, hey, what you do in your area is connected to that. So it's quite easy if you're a tobacco action worker, you help somebody quit smoking, you can make the connection. You're in the clinic, you treat somebody, you help their chronic disease, you can make the connection. So it was really just about getting staff to connect to why are we here. But it also gives you an idea that, gives the scope of services, strategic plan, which we're working on, or working to at the moment. And this was just an explanation that was given to me once as to think about it this way. The board owns a ship and the board determines where that ship's going. Cool. Which is big is why. The board then develops the strat plan, which is basically the map to get there. That tells us how to get to there. The board then appoints the captain to guide the ship and to get the crew and everything for the journey. So it's just giving people a little bit of information. Cool analogy, yeah. And for me, I like pictures too. Yeah. Some nice things for me. Yeah. And just going back, this was just recent time, 2007, the Orchard was about to close. Wow. And it was really, really funded. But Wade, the CEO back then, got back on track. We got significant funding through COA in 2010, but they might be number 50, and we'd upgrown everything that we had. And then we had a look at where we'd go from here. Conversations with the board was around, you know, wind, sea, bigger and higher temperature than this time. And, you know, that's still alive and good. Why? There's no use growing the organisation there. Well, your wine is over there. And pretty much, well, where do we go from here, get the board involved, and say, okay, well, these are some of the things we want to do. That led to what we developed back then was FIGA 2020, focused on four major things. We were also under increased pressure pressure that we take on more programs and deliver more having increased client numbers so we had to do something um that's what the strat plan focused on get the infrastructure right in order to have space do the stuff get your quality management systems so something like you saw the regular uh not working we use those some of the fingerprint scanners because we say big and spread out now and you know you need to have a system that everything is done automatically it's all automated and it's scalable to new buildings yeah instead of going well we need to be employed on five people to do it manually so that was all part of making sure that we've got all the systems we need uh get the organizational culture right make sure it's close that people want to come to work um that's the employer of choice thing and branding too because we didn't do well at branding everybody would come here and say geez don't do such awesome stuff yeah sure yeah and that's absolutely what we've done a lot there so we've got the structure right we work on what we call the client-centric model now again the future idea is the programs that we run and the idea because i understand this moment itself you know either that's my client i'm not going to help them well you might not be able to help what they need right now but you know where to take them so the client is the center of it and we all work together that just talks about the structure so again giving an idea of the the sort of programs we're doing that's going to be an area of growth into the future fits in there with social support but it also creates a link just referrals as well cool all of those things. This is what we're working on at the moment. That's where we are, at the building. We're trying to create a central health hub where everything gets close together. And for a lot of our clients who transports the big thing, just go, here's a referral, go there, or that way of getting there. So we're trying to put everything in one area here. It's taken a few years to get to where we are now, so the Healthy Lifestyle Centre was the first one. The 2025 road where the trucks are, that was the second one. And the last one we're getting now is 1240 McDonald Street. So that was the Healthy Lifestyle Centre, up and running. There's some amazing programs out there. And that's the maintenance, central halls, vehicle pool there. This is the big one that we have just started with now. The actual construction has started. We've got a lot of construction going on. We've got a lot of construction going on. We've got a lot of construction going on. We've got a lot of construction going on. We've got a lot of construction going on. It's taken a while to get there, but it has started. So that's two old buildings that we have. Again, old houses that have kind of been repurposed, patched, and just for purpose. And that's what's going on. Wow, look at that thing. So that's going to be- It's beautiful. It was originally going to be three storeys, but we had to cut the budget back after COVID, costs below us and everything. That's looking at it from the top, as if you were standing at the top of the street there. Wow. The idea is that you'll have a lot of the the TWB social support stuff, client access areas will grow and floor. So places to meet the clients that aren't having a therapy room, all that sort of stuff will be grown and floor. And then up top you'll have, the RTO will have an increased training space up there so it will take on more students. And then you'll also have, there's going to be a board room up there and all of the admin function from here will go there. That will free up this building as well. And this is what the plan is when you look up the street. The central health concept, that's the existing clinic and it will all be linked up to the plus you have health and arts and everything around there. So that's where we're going with it. That's my artistic impression from the top. And it's now, Now, we've got the construction started. So this was just explaining to staff where we get the money. The urgent health managers and all that. And just in becoming an employer of choice. Workforce profile. We have 112 staff. We're round about there at the moment. We've got a few more positions. We've got a couple of agencies. We've ordered around there and we always try to be 60 to 75. We're running, right now we're at 68%. We've got a couple of other agencies that are really good for any organisation. I've not seen organisations get over 50 and they're really small. So we do a good job there. Also we've got a leadership development programme. I run a group of about 20 or so senior staff. But also look at the emerging leaders of the future. Who are they? And start working with those people. Promote people internally. And we've got an Aboriginal workforce strategy. To try and help people into the workforce. But also retain them and give them opportunities. So it's not just a... What I find a lot of mining companies just focus on bringing in apprentices. And there's no career path after that. So we save years and there's equipment. So we look at over three different levels. Assisting people to enter the workforce. Not breaking barriers to entry. Creating the aspirant culture. Giving promotion. And then we also have a strong leadership group. So that when people look at somebody who is in a leadership position. And go that person started where I am now. I can get there. And we'll also help people through things like if there's a more senior role that comes available. A lot of times people are scared to appear. Because gee if it doesn't work out then I don't have a job. So we'll redeploy you for six months and we'll keep your current job open. And see how it goes. If it all works out. I'll put somebody on a temp contract in your current position. If it works out. Well then we'll just appoint you into the senior role. And we'll put somebody into the junior role. And if you go. It's a more long term way of doing it. But I just find you have to work on those three levels if you're going to make it a success. Don't just focus on we've got three apprentices this year. Wow. You've got to look at the different levels. This was a tour of the world. We had a few little attitudes happening. One of the big unthinking things we talked about is skill versus attitude matrix. I would rather have somebody with a great attitude and a low skill base. Because I can teach the skills they can be learnt. So I can send them on training. Or somebody who's got a high skill level. With a really terrible attitude and just upsets everyone. And is difficult to work with. So we tend to look for people who are the right fit. And if you maybe need a little bit of training to get the papers, the tickets, whatever. We'll help you do that. And that's what we talk about there. People generally fit into one of those three categories. Can do's are those who have got the great attitude and a low skill set. They're just out there kicking goals all the time. Can't do's are the ones that have got great attitude and a low skill set. And they're the ones who train. And the won't do's are the ones that can't do. And the ones that don't do's are the ones that normally tend to be older people. And they don't know how to do everything. And don't want to work with people. And don't encourage them at all. This is the first leadership group that went through. We actually had, we contracted the leadership W.A. To come and do a specific design program for us. That was the first group. And we do this as an ongoing thing. We have different co-ops go through the year. Benefits of working with W.A. Just to remind people. We've got great hours. There's a whole lot of other benefits. We shut down for two weeks over Christmas. Yeah, Bill was telling me that. He loves it. You get two weeks pay. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, just looking at all the different benefits. And then we also talk about the expectations that I and the board have of you as an employee. That you are committed to the year's vision. You're not here for the year's vision. You're not here for other purposes, egos or whatever. You know, respect in the workplace. No working silos. And this one, the issue. Unhealthy workplace behavior. I can't stand it. Walking in someone's room whispering something in the corner. It's like, nah. Don't like that at all. This was talking about getting our systems in place. So, SharePoint, ComEx, biometric, all those things. You see that everything is there now. As we grow. You can just scale and expand into different building things. Same with your finance, you know, payroll, all those sorts of things. You don't have to now go and figure out, well, if we grow from 112, what if we turn to 100 more staff? You can just grow with the organization. So that's all in place and there. The marketing, obviously our branding was terrible. But we're doing a lot now. Yeah. And just working together towards. Bit of media. Yep. Cool. This was all just over the last two weeks. Oh, cool. And then, so this is what I put up for staff just to think about. Awesome. So, pretty much, hey guys, let's understand. And again, this is really to try and get people to understand why we're here. That's not something we're doing for the money. It's something we're doing for the people. So, you know, we're doing it for the people. And I think that's a really good thing. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's a really good thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, this is not just a job. And a lot of people coming in don't even know what the vision is. It's just, oh, it's just a job we're just doing. But this is what I'm trying to get people to think about and why we're here. Extend life expectancy, yeah. There we go. Awesome. That's great. Kind of selling us back with it. That's awesome. Thanks so much. And is there, is there a particular. There you go. Yeah. Is there a particular question. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. near future thing that you're working towards that has to be done in a certain amount of time or what's your next? Well, the bigger 2020 Strat plan it was all on track to be done by 2020 but COVID hit. We got everything else except that last building and that got delayed I'd say significantly because we continued on with the design and everything throughout COVID and then when we started emerging from it came time to start construction and the quality surveyors came back and said oh, the original budget was 12 million and I don't remember there was all sorts of issues about supply of building materials worldwide and they've come back and because of all those things now we've revised your 12 million figure to 18 but it could even go up to 20 and just in the next year or so. So we don't have that much money so originally it was three storeys and it literally just stopped the entire thing start again and then we designed it in a different way so that we want the same capacity but it fits the budget that we've got as well but the short-term thing is right now it's getting that up and running because I'm still getting pressure by different funding bodies to take on new projects Okay, Brian, I try to follow up on this It's one of my major implications it's simply that with electric components they are are all slightly美味ous even though they're from not necessarily new you don't really use Singapore it gets punished it's just I think it's a very hard doing around okay we'll think about when that's all done and that's when our current scrap plan is focusing on is where we're going once we've got everything in place because we needed to put a bit of a pause on Viva's growth to consolidate and get everything right and now you guys as a board need to be thinking how do we grow in this place, which direction do we want to take and the storyline with your why. There's a lot of ideas and things that people want to do. That's why I've said I've got it because I'm the number one. Oh we need to get this, we need to get this, we need to get this in. We've got to get this right first guys. Get it right. Good job, yeah. Look at that focus, yeah. So I hope that's just going to be all of it. I'll let you continue. Yeah. Okay. We'll do some yarns. Okay. And then I've, yeah, I've definitely put my little pitch in for my next trip so yeah I'd love to connect up early on in the piece and we can, yeah, if you're keen on other stuff too, it's like content based, story based, always keen to help. Was that recording? This? Yeah. Yeah? I think so. No, no it wasn't. Sorry. I do sometimes. I didn't know you had that on. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Paul Kayne & Kay Peterson\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAlright. This is excellent. Cool. Are you ready? No. Okay. So do you just have to do your full name and spell it for me first one by one. My name is Paul Kane. KA Paul, KANE. Yeah. And my name is Kay Peterson. K-A-Y-E-P-E-T-E-R-S-O-N. So tell me a little bit about yourself first. I am a retired old lady, a dotting aunt mother of two dogs, born and bred in Hobart, still here.\n\nYeah, ex-teacher, ex librarian. That'll do amazing. What about yourself? I'm a retired technician, electronics technician. I moved to Hobart about eight years ago. I do a lot of bush walking and and things in the bush here. That's about it. How'd you first hear about Orange [00:01:00] Scott? I went looking for volunteer organizations.\n\n'cause I've obviously been retired. It's nice to be able to if you've had a lucky life, like I'd probably count myself as having it's nice to be able to. Do something for people that aren't having such a lucky life. Cool. Yeah. And yourself? Had you heard about Orangeburg? I heard about it oh, 10 years ago when the boys first started out in Queensland, and I thought it was such a great idea.\n\nAnd now that I'm retired, I've got a bit of time and I miss the social aspect, especially being a teacher. When you stop, you miss. Miss that contact. So it's nice to have conversations with everyday people. That's cool. Seems like a really cool vibe here with with the service provider.\n\nWhat's how do you feel about that partnership and how that works? I think that they're highly supportive. Yeah, it's a it's a good relationship between us and them. They keep an eye on us. Just in case things go wrong out [00:02:00] here. No, I think they've been pretty good. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And the team that we work, with's always really lovely too. Like I was a bit apprehensive starting 'cause I'm fairly new, but you just made me feel welcome and there's great rules and good support yeah, it's fabulous. And what was that like starting, what was the process you had to go through to.\n\nGet to your first, it was quite a lot of online information that you had to weed through lots of OC health and safety, which is important, but a passed, and I'm here. They gave me the hat. And what keeps you guys coming back to shifts? What's the main thing that excites you to keep coming back?\n\nI think you build up a relationship with some of the people obviously here. Not so much today because it seems to have changed over. But I enjoy the company of the of everyone on the shift. We got, we've had been very lucky. We've always had lovely people. It's good. What sort of conversations do you have with your [00:03:00] family and friends about Orange sky and volunteering and stuff?\n\nDo people get it or? Interesting my family's been really supportive of it and they knew that I'd do something and I'm glad it's not involving food 'cause I'm not good with food. I can, better with the washing. Some of my friends were a bit surprised. I. They, they wouldn't put themselves in this position they thought, but it's perfect for me.\n\nI like having conversations with interesting people. So perfect for that, isn't it? Absolutely. Yeah. What do you reckon the, from your own perspective, the most important part of it is? Is the washing connecting with people? Is it volunteer stuff? What's. What stands out as the most important part of the year?\n\nI know, I think I think it makes such a genuine difference to people's lives. It's nice to hand over clean clothes, clean, warm clothes to someone that's that, that hasn't got access to, to, washing machines and all the rest of [00:04:00] it. Yeah I think it's a really good little niche in the, in, in this sort of organization.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You can't be, I just think of that night when you jump into bed after you've washed your own sheets, there's nothing better than that feeling. And to be able to share, to give that to someone who can't do it for themselves is great. Yeah. I'd say it makes a big difference to people's minds.\n\nWhen they get nice when they get all their clothes back. Yeah. Because, so sometimes they're a little bit, some of the lights are a little bit ju I'm sure they're glad they're clean afterwards. Yeah. That's cool. Anything that we didn't touch on that you feel is like a cool part of Orange Sky or got any feedback from Nick and Lucas?\n\nOr you wanna talk? Rubbish about general, or I was just so impressed with the the process and the professionalism of it all. It's just amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. No, nothing. It's just [00:05:00] sometimes the new system was very trying for a little while, but, once I timed out, it's fine. It's good.\n\nYeah. Systems are always varied. Implement and yeah. Yeah. I think they're getting close to 3000 volunteers at across Australia. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, some pretty, that was one of the reasons I bounced because it's getting way too big and important for me. Yeah. I'll go back to doing this stuff.\n\nYeah. Good. Cool. Just.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Uncle Dale\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nUncle Dale: Dale, why is why is programs like what we did today so important for justice? Our school holiday programs, they're important just to teach our young people about who they are and, and what that means to be First Nations children. And because our people have been so generationally subjected to injustice, systemic racism and institutional discrimination.\n\nWe need to start teaching our young people early about the importance of their self worth and self value so that we can hopefully encourage them to not encounter any institutions or systems. that caused them detrimental or physical or emotional harm. Because trauma for our people [00:01:00] is so real and it is intergenerational and we're surrounded by it in our First Nations communities and we need to move ourselves out of that state of oppression back to a free state of conscious well being.\n\nWhat what does this justice program with the, the elders are leading mean to you? It means a lot. The primary focus of the initiative is on the youth and criminal justice systems. But for us, we've identified how we can't just address that, those two components of justice without addressing all aspects of justice entirely.\n\nAnd this gives us an opportunity. to be able to move forward through our own self determination to find our own culturally attractive alternative initiatives that we aim [00:02:00] to reduce the numbers of our young people and to prevent them coming into encounter but also to correct the impacts of recidivism.\n\nThis, this project, I think it's the same beautiful essay around like, yeah, what, what justice means to you and the vision for the community? Well, with this original initiative of justice reinvestment modelling, we hope that after the two years of our partnership contract with the Commonwealth, that we'll be able to develop up our own alternative strategy.\n\nOur own alternative strategy will involve our own healing centre on country. That healing centre will be a place that can also be utilised by our youth, through a range of different initiatives. That includes employment and training and higher education opportunities. [00:03:00] And at that healing centre also we need to have attached to it our own culturally facilitated rehabilitation centre.\n\nWe need to have like a halfway place for our young people that are getting out of the institutions of the justice system. And we need to train all of our own people up so that they have the professional skills and abilities to implement this initiative and facilitate it into the future as a part of our own nation rebuilding.\n\nWhat what do you hope people the young people took away from today's program? Well, for starters, it's teaching them things that they don't really know about their own people and the history of ourselves. And from that, taking away understanding and knowing. But in our efforts from all of the programs we have, it's restoring their pride and the value of their [00:04:00] self worth and the importance of that for them as a part of a people.\n\nWhat's it's always What does this year look like for the program and what do you hope? Oh, well, due to the limitations of time that we have with regards to the contract, it's going to be a massive year and it's going to be a year where we're, I'm sure, going to face a lot of obstacles and challenges but as we do as a people through our self determination and self resilience, we'll Endure and pursue it with the best of our ability to try and make sure that our objectives are met.\n\nBecause of how critically important it is for our young people especially. And, and how like the Elders are leading the way in Australia and doing, you know, a program like this. You're one of the first to get funding, like what does that mean for you and the Elders? [00:05:00] It's a great opportunity because we haven't had much support at all up until recently to address the issues of intergenerational trauma and the negative impacts and effects that that causes.\n\nAnd for people that are living in communities like our own, we can see because of us being so surrounded by. That trauma being lived out and the dysfunction it causes. So, hopefully, we'll start to see positive changes come soon. And that's why we're focused on our young through a lot of different aspects, including education.\n\nSo that we can start now to heal the next generations of our people. Is Yeah, well, [00:06:00] I just think also like with this opportunity we're faced with now in the modelling and how we've got the federal government support, it needs to be realised that out of this effort that we're undertaking, there's going to be a lot of recommended legal reforms that need to be addressed and we hope that further governments will commit to these initiatives and provide us with the necessary funding.\n\nThat's required to implement these types of initiatives and programs. And we hope that their commitment is going to be ongoing so that we can see the actual physical, emotional changes that are needed to reverse the intergenerational trauma impacts of racism and discrimination. Thank you.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Georgina Reflections\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's been awesome. This has been. Like perfection in terms of what we wanted to do. Oh, really? I'm so pleased. So what's, yeah, tell us about what you are thinking now.\n\nWhat's your, where's your head at from when you first thought about this happening to maybe now? \n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I've had a pretty deadly experience being here and I've just loved connecting in with the community and just hanging around and yarning and listening. And yeah, the elders and the time that Patricia and LTI have given us has just been phenomenal.\n\nSo I'm really grateful for their generosity of time and just spending, the time to actually give us an insight into their culture. And I always come thinking I know a bit, but I always come away thinking, I dunno very much at all, but I know a little bit more every time. So for me it's been a really insight into culture more than anything.\n\nAnd to [00:01:00] connections and relationships and, deepening friendships with people that I didn't know before. Now that having spent this time. We now have become friends. So as far as, thinking about it from a Snow Foundation perspective, certainly I've learned a lot about the importance of having a healthy home and I.\n\nOh, look at those beautiful kids running in the country. I just love it. It's so beautiful. And there's a dog about to come over and greet me. Hello Puppy? Yeah. Nice. Hello Puppy. Hello puppies. I yeah, so I guess for me, I'm just needing time to digest what we've just. Seen and heard and felt, and certainly I think that healthy homes is the start of everything because you need to have a home that you can call home and that you're happy with, and the wind can flow in and out and you can have your family [00:02:00] there and you're free from mites in your in your home and in your walls and in your bed.\n\nAnd you can have a. Have a kitchen that you can cook in and have a roof over your head and a home that's not too hot in the summer and not too freezing in the winter when it doesn't need to be. And also one that's not costing a bomb. And in fact you don't even know that it's costing and then all of a sudden you have no power.\n\nSo for me, we've seen lots of homes, that felt a bit uncomfortable. Didn't feel that it was their, the home that you'd wanna call home. There's lots that that I've learned, but I've also learned that, the people in the culture here are really great people and they wanna they wanna just look after their family and look after their community and spending time with.\n\nYeah, Patricia and LTI and Diane, and then meeting at the cultural center, which is really amazing. [00:03:00] Mr. Jones and Jimmy and just hearing about the journey that people from Tenant C Creek have been on to where they are now, \n\nThat's first. And then I bring that role of being a CEO and that's a blessing that I feel that I've got some influence to make some change.\n\nSpeaker 3: And, for us at the Snow Foundation, it is about listening to communities and empowering communities. That's a big part. And it's also about backing really great people. So we've been lucky to be joined by the team from the goods project who are doing these beds. Really simple beds that are really lightweight crates.\n\nAnd you have a mattress, it's a topper. That can be washed and so it can create clean bedding. And it's really interesting. The reaction has been so overwhelmingly positive and for me to get that insight is just, [00:04:00] validated what they're doing. So Nick and Ben from Curious Tractor very extraordinary.\n\nFellows that have spent time in the community with us as well, and we've just seen that the community just say, yes, we would love these. Beds, and they are crates, but they're covered by this topper that makes it look like just one big mattress. And you can have a bed this high off the ground, or it can have it this high off the ground, and then it can be transferred forward into storage.\n\nIt can be taken in and outside because that's all part of the culture here of having that opportunity to be inside and outside. As far as our purpose, it's about empowering communities. They want those beds and it's about supporting inspirational entrepreneurs like Ben and like Nick from Curious Tractor. \n\nThey are the two objectives that we look at. We look at empowering communities and we look at backing entrepreneurs because. We are well aware that social [00:05:00] change requires innovation and great people to take those risks.\n\nSpeaker 3: And if they're gonna work with communities and empower communities, then we're, we've gotta back them. So you start small and then you realize that you're onto a good thing. \n\nOur role is is to plug the gaps. There's quite a few gaps to plug. So we can't do it all. We can do our bit. And we can catalyze others to do their bit as well. I certainly see from spending time here as a person, but also as CEA is to go back and share those learnings.\n\nSpeaker 3: And they're responsible and responsible to do that. And people are curious. I'm from Gal Land in Sydney, what were you doing in Tenant Creek? What did you hear? What did you learn? It's my job to share that and. We've been as a foundation, very committed to rheumatic heart disease for 12, 13 years, and we've just done a new strategy and we're committed another five.\n\nAnd part of doing that is listening to what else [00:06:00] we can do. So one example that we've got a great insight into is. The healthy housing or perhaps some of them housing, that's unhealthy. And we have supported a house that's yet to be built, but it's been designed by the community, which is culturally appropriate.\n\nIt's solar powered. It's gonna be sustainable for the future. And the design is all in play. They've got loads of partners, the puppies back and. This is something small. It's one home, but it is gonna make an extraordinary difference 'cause it's gonna be a home that's gonna be suit suitable and healthy for a long time.\n\nAnd it should, it'll be built this year and hello and from that, once it's tangible, I think that's, it's gonna be an example for so many to say this is this is visionary. And it's achievable. And one home, there'll be another home, and then there'll be another, and then there'll be more. So I think that's our bit, we can catalyze change.\n\nWe [00:07:00] are not government. We are never gonna be into housing, but we can do our little bit and share that. \n\nSpeaker 2: Got a bunch of kids hanging around. Yeah. \n\nSpeaker 3: Loving that. How are we girls? We are the boys. Any boys? All girls. Love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there a, okay, is there a secret sauce or is there something in which you see as important for young kids? We got all around us here yeah. \n\nSpeaker 3: It is about healthy kids and educated kids and healthy families, they need their. They need their parents and their aunties and uncles to be around and, wrap them up and give them love and give them, look at this place that we're in.\n\nThere's so much joy. Take some photos. Yay. Oh my gosh. Can I take a photo too? Hang on. Okay. Okay. Look at me \n\nyeah, so I think it's all about having kids and families healthy and being educated and when I say educated, in oops, woo. [00:08:00] Educated in their own culture and keeping their language, retaining their culture, but also understanding the two worlds.\n\nAnd we need to do our bit as well to do that as well. But I just think to have these healthy kids grow up to be healthy parents and uncles and aunties, that is the goal, isn't it? Awesome. \n\nWhat about Ru tails? That's what we're having tonight. That is, I've never experienced a retail, so this is gonna be new to me. Have you, do you like tails? Yeah, we might be sharing the RU tail, I think.\n\nI just wanna say I'm hugely grateful to Simon Quilty. He's been awesome. We've spent a lot of time with him and the family that he he lives and works with and I'm very grateful for.\n\nHe, trusting me to be introduced to all of these beautiful families. And so I'm very grateful to Simon Norman who is the main lead in that family and Will [00:09:00] Genta and also all the family members that we've met through that, Patricia and Jimmy Selena. Too many. And I'm also hugely grateful that we've had the joys.\n\nSpending time with Nick from Orange Sky and Curious Tractor and also Ben from Curious Tractor. So I just wanted to make sure that was quite clear that's been a great joy as well. Nothing like collaborating together. \n\nI have a board meeting on Monday, so I will be sharing what I've just experienced and I think it'll need some time to digest and work through.\n\nWhat next, but we already have a great commitment to rheumatic heart disease and what is evolved around that, which is the healthy aspect of healthy homes and a whole lot of community projects around that and. Washing machines and healthy beds and all that sort of stuff. As well as having, rheumatic heart disease champions in the community, and enabling, these kids to get access to great education about their health and their hearts and their skin.\n\nWe'll just be, we'll be continuing on that [00:10:00] for some years. But I need to digest all this culture and what next? 'cause we do have a commitment to cultural understanding within our foundation as well. \n\nI think philanthropy. Is gaining me momentum in the understanding of indigenous communities.\n\nAnd I think the momentum has accelerated with the First Nations referendum. So whilst it was no, and I personally and many were devastated. I think philanthropy was a big part of that. And we're more connected into what First Nations people actually wanted and why they wanted that First Nations voice.\n\nSo I think for me there is a lot of talk about first Nations communities and working together and empowering and understanding the two different worlds and how we can play a part in catalyzing the change that needs to be had. \n\nI think absolutely. It, it should grow and I, but I absolutely think it will grow. And I do think that First Nations voice [00:11:00] whilst failed, I think philanthropy recognizes it has a responsibility to keep the wave of doing and doing work in First Nation space.\n\nStep on the gas, get busy.

It's fine, it's fine. Good. Good. But we would be fine with them. Of course. With some yes, with some better and with others not. Of course. With others yes, with others no. Of course. But yes. Today always. But they worry about you, right? Yes. Of course. That's important. There is no relationship there. No? Not even a hello. You can say hello, normally it is not said. Hey. Hello, good morning and goodbye. No? Hey. Because he has been, if you have seen once, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Now, now. But now, when they go to prison, they are like in a fishbowl here inside. And here there is a big module, here there is another big module. And they, well, they watch, well, those who are here and those who are there, well, that they don't get angry with each other. They don't fight. And, if they want something, they go to the shed and say, give me a form of whatever. But they give and that's it. But there is not that relationship of... But there they have things, like drawings to paint or something. They don't have anything, no. No no. No. No. No. No. There is nothing. No. There is nothing. No. There is nothing. No. There is nothing. There is nothing. Do you have drawings to paint or something? You have nothing, right? No. So, that's a marking. There are all the activities, but you choose if you want to go or not. If you want to go or not. And normally, if they have to choose you when you entered, not now, when you entered. Yes. They will tell you, do you want to go to class yes or no? No. Do you want to go to sports yes or no? No. It depends. No. No, for sure. You wouldn't choose, right? And now? And now yes? Are there windows in the room? There are windows in the room that can never be opened. So, always, 24 hours a day, it is in the air-conditioned area. But light comes in, right? Light comes in, yes light comes in, but they are a little darker. Oh okay. There is light in Australia, but normally windows are quiet, small in the center. In the room they are darkish. And what sport is there? Well, sport. What kind of sport is there in Australia? Oh, rugby league, AFL. What is there? Football. Rugby? Me. My goodness. What? Basketball more or less? Basketball? Basketball a little bit? Soccer or not, really? A little bit. A little bit of football, but above all it is, it is that the national sport there is... How many hours of sports are there? What? How many hours of sports are there? How many hours of sports per day? How many hours? What do they play? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? How many hours? What do they play? What? About zero, some one. Most zero. I don't know, it doesn't go by day. Maybe they get to do sports once every two, three, four days. Or not, don't see. Or at most, maybe an hour a day. But it is not organized, it is simply. Randomly. And it is not organized, but maybe it says, let's play football, come on let's play football, that's it. And if there is any problem, what I have said is that you have to do sports. How do you do sports? How do you do sports? How do you do sports? How do you do sports? Well, it's a sport sport. The problem may not be that he is just angry, but the problem may be that there are not enough workers, well he says, well today there is no football. And never, never, never, never, never the educators, since there are none, do not play for. So they spend all the time locked up, right? Most of the time they are locked up in the module or in their room. Now, don't see. Don't see. Don't see. Don't see. Don't see. Let's see. The big difference is that the groups are so few because they separate them and sports don't happen. No, it doesn't happen. They don't even have a board or card game. Do they take a board game, tracks, something like that? No no. Video games, no. In addition, they have a play for all modules. Oh, what a marking! How is it done? How grateful I am to you. No no. How grateful. You have to value it. You have to value it. A lot, a lot of talking among them. That's it, talking. But in the end you get tired of talking. In the end you get tired and... And it makes you think more and more and more and I have I don't know how many days left and one day it makes you stop for a week. Yes Yes. You have been one day of acts that you say, what a long day it is being for me... And when they put a parter on you, that you are sitting in the chair you can't think anything. Or anything, no. That you say, damn. Well, imagine that every day is like that. He says that it is very important that what I told you before, John, is that you have to know that there is no educator there, they are all security and none of them trust security and security don't trust the kids. So, these times the only thing that security does is try that they don't fight. There are like hugs. Or zero hugs. No no no no. That you are having a bad time. You swallow it. And how much? And there is no one. Ah, your room. Well, it usually happens to him. And what happens to the more headstrong ones? That security comes to you. Yes, he also comes. It reduces you.\n",

We talking? We could start. My first question. So we've been hanging out for a little bit. What's the best way for me to...\nI'll just do... What do I call you? Call me Uncle Alan. Uncle? Uncle Alan? Yeah, and then I'll just do welcoming in. Do welcoming in and then we can roll. Okay. Yeah, you can talk to me. You don't have to talk to the camera. All right. Good morning, everyone. My name is Alan Palm Island. We are here on...\nBungaman Barra, Great Palm Island, Daru Maru. We look around Great Palm, all the rest of the islands around us, surrounding islands. And we are here today, a little bit myself. Our skin name is Nakawaraka, skin name. And our language name, our language is Mulkaal.\nAnd we speak in our town that we speak our language, that we call it Nakarawaraka Purpanbara. You're welcome to Great Palm. But I say the Pukumanbara. Pukumanbara means Great Palm Island, Mambara. And Darumaru means the rest of the islands or surrounding islands.\nOr Palm, Great Palm. And today, I just wanted to say that the islands behind me, it's Ngaru, they call it Kirisho. Ngaru up there, North Palm, and Guggenbaden. And across here, we've got Guggenbaden is Hoffia's Island.\nAnd you got to cross over here to Amelia, which is Phantom Island. Great Palm is sitting on, as we got here on our emblem, is Mingna Mingna Ranges. And in this emblem, we have a...\nWhich we call a shield. We call Bukal. Bukal means shield. And we, we put, I put the designs on it as a tool because our boundary is, is come into form of a, of a big manta ray. Our boundary, we call it Mingana Mingana Ranges. Mingana Mingana. Our boundaries is that area of Great Palm Island. And in that area, we keep,\nAnd I'm just trying to welcome you all today. Thanks for coming. And you go ahead. Super powerful. Pleasure to be here with you. Yeah, we can go lots of ways with this, but I think the first thing is how would you like to talk about yourself as a person from here? And how would you like to introduce...\nWell, for myself, I got my totem. It's Kurenja. Kurenja means stingray. And that's where I got my totem because you can't eat my totem or you get sick. I said, no, I'll leave it as it is. Well, my highest...\nI've been traveling a lot around myself. As a small boy, my father taught me how to paint. And as I was starting off, he just showed me how to use a charcoal and did a drawing on a piece of paper. And then I started...\nPainting and I also learned from him also what he does. A lot of work of making buccal, making shields and making drums, island dance from when I was small and I just used to watch dad always paint and I just got to learn a lot about it and very interesting for me and me and my brother Reg, my elder brother. Reg and Walter, my elder brother. And whenever they go, I follow behind.\nAnd they'd say, no, you can't come. You've got to go back. Get back. Yeah, well, they said, all right. And they'd come back. But I always go, and I learn things from my dad. But sometimes we grow, too. And eventually, we went on a different route now and started growing up.\nWe went to schools, and Dad always been busy, so we had to learn English and maths and that. Sometimes Dad always send us to do some paintings with some elders, people. But we learned what Dad taught me too, how to paint too, and painting the shields and all that too.\nAnd for myself. Been travelling a lot when I left there from Palm and as I went to school, high schools and I did some, spread my wing out and go and travel around, looking around and checking out universities and TAFEs with arts, art colleges and all that.\nI learned a lot from that. And from that, then I sort of think that I would rather come back home now and start doing better work for Mambara now. And today now, we started our Mingna Mingna rangers up and develop. And this is how we today now.\nThanks for that for all of us. We got the Bulkerman people also with us too. And they will work with us. Thank you. Amazing. I need to say this. I got to put in a platform. But is it still running? Yeah. We cut it. Yeah. I'd love to hear a little bit about what it was like being...\nBeing young and did you have a concept of what like this place was or culture was when you were young or were you just learning? What was that experience like? Well, my experience was, like I said, to go back when I was young and that was my, that was sort of planted on me, my dad and then I grew with it, see, but...\nThat's where I grew older and we had to go to learn the basic things like the stories, dream time stories. Because me, our uncle, Rich, my dad brother, he had all the story, all the dream time stories and tell about the gobble dreaming and the sister rocks and all that.\nAnd then we had to go into, he sent us down to Uncle Bill, Uncle Bill Congo. And we went down there and he taught us how to paint in his way, see? And we learned by his way. And that's how eventually the story has started to develop as a concept of children's storybook.\nFor the people. And also we had Bill Blackley, who was also a teacher at Palm Island State School. We called it State School before, but today they call it Bullgerman School. And he used to be my teacher too, also Bill. And he also brought all the stories together and...\nAnd develop it and recreate it into a story which was created by my dad. I call it dad because it's my uncle and my father. And then that's how it all started out and sort of kept me going. And by the time when I left then I went to college, did some artworks up there.\nSort of grew on me and started using different style of artworks like using screen printing, batiks and also lino printing.\nAnd we do some bit of works on campus and then we do a lot of traveling and selling them. I was at the Cairns College of TAFE back in, I think it was 1980s, 82, 83, 1983. And then from there, it was there, then I went up to Northern Territory then and to Kasserina University and did my diploma of fine arts.\nAnd from there, I would stay there for five years. When I got my graduate diploma of fine arts, they asked for a student to go down to Melbourne, the RMIT. I went down for a student residency and worked with the students in RMIT.\nTeach them our culture through there. And what I learned from there, printing, lino prints and all that, etchings. And I stayed there until three, four, five years now. Another five years. And then as I'd done all that, I was pretty good at that and came back to Palm. I was a bit homesick, I think.\nThe weather was down, it was cold. And when I left Darwin, Northern Territory, it was hot. And then I went down to the cold area. Sort of different sort of way. And when I look at it, you know, new life.\nWhat did it feel like? Did you feel like you were always representing your culture and your place in all of those places when you were doing your art?\nLike how did you learn technique that then matched with your cultural?\nWell, yeah. Well, basically with different, with a technique like a lino print, it's just so you're not using a knife, using a brush, you're also using a pen, using a knife. Then you have to cut the material and to carve out the image that you want to put on the lino print.\nOn the lino, then you use Indian ink, then you roll it on top of it, then you put it through a press. It's like a press, you know, what a press does when they do printing for newspapers and all that. It's sort of different. This is an idea, but it goes in a different perspective, like back to front, but it goes the right way we wanted it.\nSo you have to line it up, and roll it through and then the next step you get to start, you get the first stage, you gotta use six different colors, overlay different color layers of colors, ink, Indian ink, and it's very, very good too. It keeps me going.\nWhat is it about art that made you want to do it? Was it to tell a story? Was it to represent your culture?\nWell, you know, arts always said, all this arts is coming to be something that's more creative in your mind, in your mind that you want to create something. So like wood carving, you want to make...\nCarve out a dugong on the wood. So you carve, it's how you create, how you create that image. In an art, it's a flowing thing. It's an expression. It sort of gives you the reality of what you see and what you know. And then you can sort of use the brush as you, as a...\nAs your heart and your mind take you to it and you create something. Aboriginal art, it's unique.\nAre you comfortable talking me through, you showed me an artwork at the hospital and you had a snake.\nYeah.\nAre you comfortable talking through that and what the story is?\nThe story there that when we tell the story of that, that when I done at the hospital with the Gabul dreaming, see? So it was the snake that came down from Herbert River, came all the way down and he came all the way down and he...\nAnd broke into pieces and then he came through and went up that way and landed on and came down that way to see where he came to Palm, made his way to Palm and then...\nAnd then we came to a water hole with bamboo cricks. And that snake lays there. And then the old family said, no, you can't go up there. Tell the daughters not to go up there swimming. You're not allowed to go up there swimming. But they went up and then went for a swim there.\nAnd then the snake took them all the way up. That way he ran all the way up to, going up to Mount Bentley, all the way around. And then the Gabul snake came down to, they call it, Barbara Bay. And there you got, you have Gabul Snake Creek there. And the land, it was all water, no water was there.\nCrawled all the way up to a place called Mad Daddy Garland and he went to Mad Daddy. The old man, the old father, he was a clever man too. And he trailed, he followed the tracks all the way and went all the way all over. And he came down to Gabul Snake Creek where the snake went through. Then today there, you go around there,\nAnd then you see that creek there still running. It's called the Carpacini Creek, around where Barbara Bay is, and then Osho Bay there, in between there. And it went all the way over to Magnetic. And then they found him there, found him there.\nHe asked, that Gabul snake didn’t ask him not to kill him. And he said, take the daughter, take the girl and brought her back. And he didn’t want to kill the snake, so the snake, he said, he let the snake go. And he went, grabbed the girl and went back to Palm. And the girl was sick, so the old man just healed her.\nToday and today, you see that when he go, that Gabul snake, he let him go because he went up to the Ross River and he created the Ross River and that was it. That’s the whole story connected.\nWhy did that story sort of connect you to you and why did you end up painting it? Was there a reason or was it just a feeling?\nWell, the Gabul, it’s a totem. And it’s a story connection to country, and the dreaming, and the connection with our dreamings connected to the island. The same as the creator, he created all these islands too, also.\nWhen he came then, all the way from, came across to Herbert River, he came through Herbert, came down to Herbert, created that Herbert River, then came through it, and all the way landed and came to Palm. And from there, he went over there to Magnetic, and Magnetic went straight up to and created Ross River. And the story, and it's come back again to us.\nAnd it’s connected with us too, with our dreaming, with Gabul dreaming. And it also gives us the thoughts that we’re here with Herbert River. It’s where all that area, it’s where we all come down with descendants and families. We come from up Tableland all the way down and to Palm and the connection there and all over too.\nAnd that’s why, that’s why Dad or grandfather would always say, we’re under the umbrella of the Rukurrukaba country.\nUkurukaba, this oldest big area that we cover under, we are called Kunu people. Ukurukaba means Kunu people. It’s very special. Yeah, it’s a little special. And we also associate with Banyan, Hinchinbrook Banyan.\nNowagi, over that side, Waihingum and all that area. And also come down to Rukurrukaba, Ulkuru and Bindal, all that area there. And all this connection has come under the umbrella of Rukurrukaba country. We’re all Kunu people.\nHow do new people come onto the island and understand that? Like the complexity and the simplicity of that? How do you best welcome people, I guess, in the right way, and how can people come in the right way?\nWe welcome them and sometimes we go, we take them, when they come, we take them around the way, the casement there where the story tree is. We do a smoking ceremony, we welcome them and bring them into the country so that they can also be protected from bad spirits. And let them enjoy themselves on Palm and welcome them on Great Palm itself.\nBukkuman Parah. Bukkuman Parah means Great Palm Island and welcome them all over. Everyone over Great Palm and enjoy themselves. And they go back.\nWhat’s the... I don’t know what the question is, but... Palm’s been through a journey of many things.\nYeah, Palm’s been through a lot. You get... you get... you get Benedict, like, strikes. Hundred years celebration. And... and... Bookman holidays, you know.\nAnd you also have the memories of our brother, Peter Fry, who would tell the stories of having shot curry. And that’s a respect for... that’s the story that, his stories, and it’s still celebrated today.\nAnd respected. That’s how we give them the opportunity to show their respect, and we show our respect. And that’s how we show our respect.\nHow do you think about yourself around some of the tougher times that have happened on Palm Island?\nYou think about it, and it’s part of the journey, or is it something in which, like, happened but you need to move on? Like, what’s the... how do you feel about what happened back in the time?\nSometimes I’m not too sure, you know. Life’s...\nPeople want to live in a beautiful tropical island. It’s beautiful, but the responsibility, we go back in the time, we look at it. When you go back under the Act, when you look at the old pictures, old photos, beautify that island, it’s all clean. And it’s just like that. We’ve been under the Act, see?\nWe were like prisoners, and we showed that we cleaned places up. But when the Act was gone, we were free. We can do what we like. We’ll do what we can. And the purpose is that we can’t change. We’ve got to go forward and try to develop and sometimes move on.\nAnd there’s also a time for celebration. And I don’t know. There’s some amazing things happening on Palm Island. There’s some tough things as well that people are working through.\nWhat’s some of the things that you hope will happen over the next maybe like 10 to 20 years on Palm? Are there things in which you’re hopeful about?\nI want to remember that, hopefully, that everybody be all together as one and work together and respect each other and celebrate what we can. Keep Palm... keep Palm beautiful and keep going ahead, going ahead in the future. And that’s what I look at.\nBut for myself, I like to develop something for myself and bring something. Maybe we can, because Palm's going to be around when they have tourism coming,\nPeople that we need to work in and develop, you know, business and all that on Palm. So I want to try and do something for... have a little place for where we can bring young people back into culture, learning things that are, that are vulnerable at Palm.\nI think culture is most important. People will stay focused on things that happened back there, but history...\nCan repeat itself, you know. But we got to go, we got to use every resource that our culture will go forward and keep it with our young generation coming up. And nobody with a telephone or mobile phones in this beautiful place where this whole inspiration is all around us. Everything’s here.\nSo you told me a really inspiring vision yesterday.\nYeah, I was going to bring it up one day.\nI’d love for you to...\nTalk through what that vision is.\nI was saying that I was talking about it, trying to bring it out and trying to bring it so I can explain it.\nI felt the segue was good.\nYeah, try to bring it in and try to explain it, how I’m going to do it.\nYeah.\nI was there last night. We should have talked about it.\nBut you’re going to start working, is it on?\nI’ll edit it.\nYeah.\nI can ask you specific questions about it.\nWell, I was looking at North East Bay, and I was trying to think of that I was going to do that just to make it a little camping place for young kids and kids that seek...\nI’m thinking of a word that might bring it up in a language name, but it’s \"seek and you shall find.\"\nAnd it sort of creates culture in perspective, where you can see it or believe it or you don’t. It’s up whether it’s with your heart, whether you want it to happen.\nCulture is most important. That’s why I want to create this camping, so that maybe they don’t go to school, maybe they like to, but education comes first.\nAnd also, culture brings in the... I don’t know, it’s just, it’s what I’m thinking of. I’m trying to bring it in a picture where I can make it happen, but it’s...\nSome other people help, you know, like teachers, police, or whoever can be involved with it too, you know, more creative.\nBut it’s most important—culture first. Culture.\nCan you explain like where it is and why that place is significant, do you think, for where you want it to be?\nLorde’s Bay is beautiful. It’s quiet.\nThe beach, the water, and also it has everything there. You just have your mind thinking back and start bringing people, bringing culture back into it.\nCamping, walking back, walkabout, bush walking,\nGo seek other places and story connection too, connecting and hunting and fishing. It’s all that part of culture. We get to learn to hunt, you get to feed yourself, you get to learn to say go into the store or shops.\nMaybe now I’ll try to check everything out. That’s why I wanted to start up my vision. It’s a vision I always use because it’s away from everything.\nAnd it was isolated there. You know, also comfort and quietness.\nYeah.\nAlso, you can do your paintings and all that, and art, and create, make some shields or spears or create something.\nAnd it brings you back to...\nBrings you back to reality with culture that you want to do. And it’s what you want to do to help you go forward, to help you be more a person.\nAnd what do you think that does for a young person who is currently struggling a little bit with the system and school and stuff? Why does that experience help them, do you think?\nI know I’ve been there at school. I was struggling. I learned a few, my English and mainly my maths, but it wasn’t helping much. But it’s just looking, just that you’ve got to try harder.\nPut yourself, work harder, try to, and focus on, maybe you could get some friends around the school, help you out, keep encouraging you, parents encourage you if you need it, teachers are there too, if they need it, friends there, if you need it. All they gotta do is just...\nAnd what difference do you think having strong elders to be able to talk to makes for young people? And like how do you, with a place like that, how do you...?\nCulturally, like I go back to culture and then see your Palm, you have 40 different, 40 or 30 different tribes on the island, and each of them come from a different country, see? Different places where they come, because they come under the umbrella of Bulgaman people, and they're 32 different tribes, and as a young generation, each will have to seek and find where their connections are.\nWe’re not gonna say we’re gonna send you away back up there. You’re free to go up there back to your grandfather’s country and come back. That’s how you generate yourself to be who you really are, who you’re connected to, where your connections are. And you also go there to visit your families and your relatives.\nAnd say that, oh, my grandfather’s name was there. I was back to my grandfather’s country and come back to Palm because in that way, that sort of builds you up, see? So you know who you are. Where I come from, I got my mother, my mother is a Giribau.\nShe’s up in Madagascar. Madagascar is a whole new country. My mother and grandmother, they all worked at the station. They worked at a station called Kunawara. Kunawara Station. And then we go out there, but our grandfather, my mother, my mother’s dad, grandmother, grandmother, she said that Baja Balanar changed it to...\nKirama Station, changing to Bajabala Station, which means \"two rivers meet.\" And it’s almost not far from where the Blinko Falls are. They went up there, Mount Garnet area, that side. And that’s where the Blinko Falls, that’s where Warrung Country and Guggenbaden, yeah.\nAnd that’s where my mother’s country is, up that way, Tableland. And then I come back down here where Dad’s country is Mumbara. And here we go, Boogerman Burra. Boogerman Burra is Great Palm Island and Mumbara.\nSo how long was this?\nWe’re doing good. We’re going to beat Richard.\nOh my God, I’m going to get so bummed.\nYeah, I know.\n36 minutes, all right.\nLong, isn’t it?\nYou’re so good.\nOh, now you got to break it up and make sure it comes to the old meat. I want to look at it, see where anything goes wrong. I got to make sure.\nOh, yeah. That’s the best part.\nWe need to, we need to, we need to, we got to correct it first.\nI didn’t want to.\nYeah.\nWhat do you think young fellas’ journey through this life is like? I don’t know if it’s expectation or there’s something around understanding your culture, but then they’ve got this other world, this Western-type construct that they need to work out.\nHow do they do that? Like, is that something that... Do you think that’s why some young people are struggling so much?\nYeah. When you have these sort of things like, you know, back in the old days, we used to go walk up and look around for fruit, you know, look around for cherry trees and plums and all that, back in those days.\nWe used to go down the jetty, get some oysters. Then at the beachside, get some oysters. These were the good times back in those days.\nAnd we, you know, we walk about, we free walkabout and then take our spear, go spearfishing, go fishing, you know, around the bay and all that.\nBut the next generation, when the time, it’s all been changed because they lack, lack of this because of mobile phones are coming around and...\nAmericanized and they talking like American, as the gangsters, and talking like, and I said, oh, you’re not American, you’re bloody Aboriginal.\nWhere’s you?\nYou get mobile phones and you get all kinds of things. You get scooters, you get things that are made today, but back in our days...\nAll we had was a little foot. We walked around like we used to always do.\nBut now these days, it’s slowly, but sometimes we have to try and change, but it’s not.\nSometimes also religion plays a game in all our life too. Religion, churches. But church is good. It helps. I’m not religious, but I’m a Christian. I believe in God, you know.\nBut I also wanted to show that our first priority is to believe the way what we believe, you know. Either you want to be what you want to be. You know, we make our choices.\nBut then again, we’ve got cultural perspective too, and it might combine, but, you know...\nWe use it as what God has shown us to use it the right way. And not to kill one another. And, you know, we live as a peaceful people.\nBut I’m talking about back in the time, see, when we were all, when we had this freedom of going hunting...\nGet some cherry trees or get some plums. And guava, there was the days when we had that.\nBut now, when we go back to mobile phones and all that, we change all that. TV, telephones, even shopping used to go out there.\nWe used to go to the shop all the time and push the trolley.\nNow, it’s all that. You drive a car.\nYou can’t walk anymore, you get too used to the car, because, oh, I’m getting too lazy now. I need to drive a car.\nAnd it’s all changing.\nWe used to go out to the camping, we used to carry a little bag with blankets and all that.\nBut now you’ve got a caravan coming around and you can use a caravan.\nYou could get a tent and they could make a tent.\nWe used to make them all, a little old hut and camp underneath it.\nBut now everything’s changed, young generation.\nBut it also, protections, that’s all it needs, your protection and your health.\nWhat do you think’s going to change?\nI’d rather be back there, but now you’ve got to go forward now and make the best of it.\nBut still believe in what you can do for the young generation.\nFirst thing first.\nMake sure they get back, first priority is their culture first.\nAnd maybe they can...\nSit down and talk about what they do. You could use your mobile phone, but put it away.\nThen you can come and we’ll go walkabout, camp, and bring your mobile phone along, take photos of what we’re doing, see?\nYou create something. And sharing with culture, what you can create your mobile phone to do. And make sure that you sort of keep a continuation of history, of what you’ve been doing. And people say, oh, this is Bush Tucker. Take a photo. And that keeps it in there. It’s like your memory.\nThere are some kids that end up getting caught up in this. There’s a system called youth justice or youth detention. Is there an alternative to that that you can offer in the Palm Island community that helps those young people to change and understand how to live without committing crime or getting in trouble? Or do they have to go to prison?\nWell, things are going out of line sometimes, you know. We try our best. But focus back on the parents. Parents have a responsibility. And also, kids can do all kinds of things the wrong way.\nJust growing up, you know. Growing up. That’s all it is. Growing up too fast. Not slowing them down. Meet them on the right track. Make sure they go where they...\nExpect to be, not expect to be, to go where you want them to go. But it’s all about... I don’t know how you could put it. I haven’t got a kid of my own, but I just got my nephews and my niece and grandchildren.\nWould be my brothers and sisters. And try to keep them in the right direction and make sure they stay on that. And also mainly because when you go back in the old ways, you’ve got to have that respect. Family respect. You respect your elders. You respect your elders and you respect...\nYou respect your mother, you respect your father, you respect your brother, and also the families around you. The most important is your elders. You must respect your elders.\nBack in the old days, if you don’t listen, listen and hear, listen to what they say, you get a clip over the ears. You do the wrong thing, you get a clip over the ears.\nBut nowadays, kids can do what they like now. But even it’s up to ourselves, we can make a change, we can change it. We can use every resource that brings them...\nBring that respect back into the families, bring it back into the kids and all that. Your elders come first.\nYeah.\nIf over the next few years Palm Island starts to develop tourism as well...\nThe gentleman, he’s seen us out here. He’s checking us out.\nYeah, he was standing there looking.\nWas he?\nYeah.\nHe said, what are you doing here?\nNo way I’m getting out of here. There’s someone down there.\nSure.\nYeah, we just got a visit over the horse. He got up and just came and visited us. He wanted to join in the interview.\nSorry about that.\nIf Palm Island in the next five or ten years starts to develop tourism and more people start to come, what would you hope that they take away or that they...\nFeel when they’re here? What are the things that you think are most important for them?\nWell, it’s most important that Palm can give, what Palm can provide, and Palm can produce. Tourism can be the opportunity for themselves to develop themselves and become a...\nWhatever they expect it to be. You know, like more money, more work. We have more people working, more Wulgurukaba people, more people working together to develop something. And when tourists come, they want to see culture.\nIt’s the first priority. They want to see what Palm can produce, what Palm can have. Say, maybe we can have a dancing group. Maybe we can have a camping group.\nMaybe we can have tourism for looking at the Mingna Mingna Ranges to develop the tourist brand all over, everywhere, and touring up the hill. Mingna Mingna Ranges can control the sea and the land also.\nAnd also mainly to come back to respect the traditional owners and also the people here too, also respected as the Wulgurukaba people. And Mambara also to be a first priority.\nAnd we wanted to go forward and bring everybody forward with us, work together.\nCan you see the bay down here if you walk up there or not?\nUp here?\nYeah.\nWe can walk up.\nCan you see it?\nYeah.\nOh, my leg. I’m going to jump on that horseback.\nOh, get up.\n\n\n",

      "Transcript": "This pursuit to perfection does. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool, brother. Just tell me your name and spell it. It would be awesome. Sure. Okay, yeah. My name is Muhammad Patel. M-U-H-A-M-M-A-D. Patel, P-A-T-E-L. What's a rad, like, atmosphere with, like, the trains and the, like, seagulls and... Is there? Yeah, I guess so. Tell us a little bit about you first, brother. What's your little story in a minute? Or two minutes. Where do I start? I'm 36. Been doing this for, like, 10 years now. We used to operate both in Perth City and in, well, obviously in Frio, but now we just operate in Frio. I live, you know, about 20 to 30 minutes away from here. I live near Thornley. Wasn't born in Australia. Born in Zambia. It's about it, really. Oh. Yeah. So, tell us a little bit about how this started, I guess. Like, what was the impetus to why? Yeah, so, it started, we started in Perth City first up, in, back in, whatever, 10 years from, like, now, which was, what are we, in 2024, so 2014-ish. But the original founder, I'm not the original founder, the original founder, a guy called Wade, and he used to live, we all grew up in the same area. He also grew up in Thornley, since we were young, like, we used to play soccer together. Anyway, he popped up on my Facebook one day, just, like, handing out food to people in the city, and then, I'd say it was, like, December 2013-ish, I saw that, if I'm not mistaken. And then, March 2024 is when the first time I... I went out and started to get involved. I wasn't meant to, like, be involved, like, long-term at all. I was fully expecting that I'd just do it, like, once a month, once every two months. And I had no expectation of, like, what I would actually see out there. In fact, I had no idea about the situation of homeless people in general. And, you know, I just... I just... I just... I just... I just... I just... I just... I started, and, yeah, it was, like, just severely eye-opening. And then, just, yeah, I started going every week. Like, I couldn't... I couldn't just help myself. Great. Yeah. What do you think it is that connected you to this whole experience and wanting to give back? Was there something in your personal life, or was it just a, like, a luck-type thing? What do you think it was? I was probably at an age... I was at an age where I was... I was at a lot of, like... Probably, like, a shift in my personality, would you say? You know, you get to an age where you're, like, there's only so much, you know, partying you can do. Yeah. And then you've got to grow up, and then you kind of do. And then you think to yourself, well, what can I actually do, and why is the world the way it is? And then, yeah, just that was the pathway that I took. And I think I'm Muslim, right? So there's not... There's not... There's not a lot of Muslim outlets to express ourselves in this fashion. And so it was quite fortuitous that I saw Abu Baydah popping up at the time that he did, and I was able to get involved when I was able to. What do you... What keeps you coming back, and are there things that happen here with people experiencing homelessness? So is this, like, the impetus, or is it, like, hanging with other friends? What's the... A bit of both. Like, I think we've been doing it for so long now that, like, we've both become friends with the homeless people. Um, and then ourselves, we've actually become good friends as well. Um, so it's a bit of both. So, yeah. It's a good way to hang out. Orange Sky has just released a podcast, it's about friends, too. Sorry, who did? Orange Sky. Oh, yep. Yeah. So, um, it all started with two friends, Nicola and Luca. Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. And, um, the… The way in which they represent the people with forensic homelessness they work with is friends. Yeah. And, yeah, there's just this really interesting, you know, way of thinking about what's going on, and... And then the, um, the... The thing that's really interesting about that is that we're all here at a different time. We're all here. So... and yeah, there's just this really interesting, like, powerful idea of friendship more generally. What do you think the power is of friendship, not just in, like, supporting people, but in your own life and how it supports you? I mean, it's... That's your support network, right? So... And it's... What's the word? It's not transactional. So, regardless of where you are in your life, that friendship, if it's a, you know, real friendship, they'll always be there to support you. So, yeah. That's cool, man. Is there hopes and dreams for this thing? Is it growing? Is it the same? Is it just KC? What do you want to do? So, Frio, we've probably grown. Frio started after the city, but we've probably grown it more just because I think the time in which we do it and we're significantly more established. There is dreams of, you know, getting it larger. I hope I'm able to commit and have the funding to do all of that, but I think time will tell. It's a fine balance between, you know, work, family, life commitments, and then also organising and getting everything done for this. So, yeah. I mean, hopefully one day we can have our own kitchen and places for people to actually stay. Cool, man. What do you think the power of partnerships and collaboration is in putting people doing a task? It's everything. I think both from the infrastructure and services perspective, but also for the people on the street itself. Collaboration is just, I guess, another word for support. And that's what, like, when you have friendships, you have your community, these are the pillars of that. And last question. Do you... What's the sentiment and feeling you get when you talk with close friends or people in the community about what you do? Is there a general curiosity, fear, acceptance? Is there a general thing? Um... Yeah, it's... There's almost... There's a few different, like, I guess, aspects or, like, views on this, which is, one, you're doing a good job. Keep it up. Two, you know, they, they, as in the homeless people, have enough support. They should be able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and keep on going or get on with their lives. Get better or whatever it is, which is obviously flawed. And then the third one is almost like... How do I frame this? It's like you're feeding seagulls. If you keep feeding them, they'll keep coming back. Which is, honestly, like, some of the feedback that we've got from... Like... Word for word to, like, some of their rangers, some of their councillors. So, yeah. So that's the three views on the subject. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, totally. It's, yeah. It's unfortunate. I mean, look, truth be told, in my own... With the arrogance of youth, that's maybe... that I held as well you know we live in the lucky country and you've got every single piece of infrastructure and services available to you why can't you get yourself up but once you actually start interacting you're like wow this is I was such an idiot and this this issue is so much more nuanced than I could ever imagine sure I'm much better\n",

Is if you can just tell, oh, actually I'm the wrong frame.\n\nCool. So you just look at me. Yep. So all you need to do is just tell me your full name and then if you need to spell the last name, if it's hard. Oh. It's not hard, but I'll spell it. So my full name is Charles officially, but I go as Charlie middle name's Salvador because I'm Spanish. I was born in Barcelona, last name is Bruin, BRUN.\n\nAmazing. Bonelli. Yeah. So people get that. You may say wrong. People get that name. I got back from Barcelona two weeks ago. Oh, yeah. I was there a long time. I [00:01:00] haven't been back there, but I was born there, yeah. A long time ago. Wow. Yeah. Amazing. We're all bus, my family's all Basque family. Oh yeah.\n\nWow. Yeah. Let's start with that. Tell me a bit about yourself and okay. Your lineage or your family, whatever. As I said, you we're. Most of my family was born all over North, northern Spain, but I was born in Barcelona, so was my older brother. We've had sisters born in San Ti and Mon Blanc and we've had bil Bow all around there.\n\nBut we came to Australia in 1961. I was only four years old when we got here, and grew up in Sydney. Lived there most of my life. The type of work I was always doing was in computing. So my background is computer management, networking computer design. I'm building design. I've designed computer rooms, things like that.\n\nYeah, so it had a lot of that exposure. Fantastic jobs I've had traveling all over the state interstate because of networking systems and that, so it was [00:02:00] really enjoyable and moved to Brisbane in about 1991. And so I lived there for quite a while and. Came to Toowoomba about actually from Brisbane, we bought place in Childers.\n\nWe were there eight years in Childers, and I worked there for the Bundaberg council and I managed the Childers's art space, which was the backpacker hotel, Childers backpacker hotel. There was a big fire in year 2000. They built a memorial. They built the hotel back and made a memorial out of it.\n\nFor the 15 backpackers and half of that was for the memorial. Other half was an art gallery, so I managed that for the council. I had volunteers to roster and manage, so that was a wonderful job. Yeah. And then we moved to Nabo. We're there about seven years and we've been in Toowoomba about four years and I joined Tom Net about 12 months ago and I'm really glad I did.\n\nIt is a wonderful, really wonderful organization. Yeah. How did you first hear [00:03:00] about Tom Net? I live in a place called Gem Life. It's an over fifties resort, and that's up in high fields. And in the library I saw the little booklet about Tom Net, so just having a look and talked about Tom Net, what it does, and had a lot of other groups for older man as well.\n\nSo I rang the Tom net number, spoke to Shannon actually, and the next day was their monthly. Meeting up at the church in Getty Street. So I went along to that and I've been coming ever since. And yeah, so I, I volunteer with Tom Nan and I visit two nursing homes once a month in different days.\n\nAnd I find that fantastic. And just talking to the older guys and just asking them questions about their life, just trying to give them something different in their day. And that's a really wonderful thing too. Yeah. Yeah. What what do you think is the things that keeps you coming back [00:04:00] every week?\n\nJust the friendship with the fellas and, there's all types here. We've got barristers judges, we've got electricians, we've got dairy farmers. I'm back. My background's computing. We've got people from all walks of life. And when they come here, it's just a lot of fun. Really enjoyable. The dynamics always change depending on what type of people there are there, and it's always a wonderful interaction with them. The good thing is just to allow them to, you listen to guys tell yarns and stories and it's just a lot of fun. A lot of fun. And they're good blokes. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWhat do you think the impact is on the people that you go and do work with in community, with the schools and those other places? What's the impact for them? I think it's really, I did some reading for a while. I did reading in the public school up here in Centenary Heights and I read with immigrant Children and they were learning to speak English and read English and so [00:05:00] I initially started volunteering there and that was really enjoyable.\n\nWatching the kids grow with their English. A little bit better every time and they're watching them progress to a little bit more difficult books as they read. So that was interesting. And then I started visiting the nursing homes and I found that really wonderful, very helpful. When we talk to different guys we meet different fellas and we just interact with them.\n\nWe talk about their lives, they ask us about our lives and what we do with Tom net. It just chatting away, have a cup of coffee and it's good watching them, enjoying themselves and just relaxing with someone else because some don't get visitors very often and so they, they tell you that, oh, they don't get visited, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd it's just nice to talk to them and seeing them enjoying themselves and relating to someone else and. Listening to stories [00:06:00] or talking about their lives, I found that very helpful. And I think they enjoy it too. And the feedback we get from, the co coordinators at different nursing homes is always positive, enjoyable.\n\nAnd I also did singing as well. I was part of the minstrels for a couple of months and that's really, yeah. We go to nursing homes and sing away and. It's a lot of fun though. Some really react. They clap and they sing and others just sit there a bit, but you know that, that was a lot of fun.\n\nYeah. So I did that for a while, but and no it's great. And with the nursing homes, it's, you make friends, and next time you see the same fellow again you talk to them. And one guy was a math professor at one of the nursing homes. And we got talking about scientists and mathematics.\n\nAnd what I would do is I would take a maths problem every time I went to visit him. And we sat down together and worked out the maths problem. And it was great, A lot of [00:07:00] fun. And it was good to see him enjoying himself too, and relaxing. And because he didn't often get a chance to talk about mathematics or science or anything along those lines.\n\nSo that was, it was really wonderful. What do you think is tough around that retirement age that maybe creates some tension or struggles for some men? Definitely I think probably loneliness is the worst thing, especially if some of the Wi fellas have lost their wives fairly recently and you can tell that they, without time now, they would probably have a lot more difficulty dealing with it.\n\nSo loneliness for sure is a real problem, but. Since Tom Net's been going, I think 20 something years there, there hasn't been one suicide within Tom Net itself. So that's a wonderful thing. We currently have about 290 members and and then also friendship. A lot of the guys come here just to make friends and to do volunteering as [00:08:00] well.\n\nI'm retired and so volunteering is a fantastic thing to do. And yeah, that's about the most thing. Just friendship, loneliness would be the hardest thing. And they do offer support too. There's counseling that can be offered here officially, official counseling and a lot of other support that Anthony and Shannon would provide that we probably wouldn't be able to, just as part of.\n\nBeing their friends type of thing. Yeah. Every life, every part of life have different seasons. And it's like sometimes there's lots of babies, sometimes lots of weddings. And I feel like sometimes when you retire, there's like death can be a really big thing. Injury like states of unwellness. How do you think that affects people in community where there's maybe a lot of grief or a lot of like illnesses. Yeah. How does that affect. I think for example we reached a little, it was about three months ago, we had a death here. One of our members, Stan he had some [00:09:00] heart problems and he came here one day, it was a Thursday and he was okay talking and everything, and we all had chat chatting away with him.\n\nAnd then I found out on Tuesday he had a heart attack and died. So that was a real shock, a lot of the members were initially just shocked, but. Coming here, you can share that, share that feeling and discuss it amongst yourselves. And it's a place where you can come and share your grief and talk to others about it and see how they react.\n\nAnd, it's a, that's a good thing. And that, and there's been a few f funerals of guys that I haven't known myself. Tom would always go to the funerals. There's a real big continu you to that people supporting either the husband or the brother or whoever was left from the death, and we're always behind everybody in helping them where we can. Yeah. Yeah. Super special. Is there certain things about being a male, you think that [00:10:00] they have different needs or. Different things in which is the reason why Tom Net is here because are men better or worse at connecting, or what do you think that is in terms of being an older man?\n\nIt's great because blokes are reticent to open up their heart and their feelings and to talk about how they are feeling about a particular issue. And here, we get to see people quite often and we can tell if they're. They start coming and if they're quiet and or unhappy, we can see they're depressed or something like that.\n\nAnd we just offer friendship and we just offer, discussion, talking about things, come over for a coffee or you wanna come and visit or we'll come over and mow you lawn for you or, so we offer as much support as we can. Genuine support too, because, a lot of the guys are just.\n\nLonely, that's one of the biggest things. But they not sure how to go about talking about it [00:11:00] or asking for help. And, it's once you get them talking and then we can understand their situation, then yeah we can help out if possible. It's just a great, yeah, great mob of guys and.\n\nThere's a lot of care caring here. A lot of caring goes on and understanding and that, and it's not perfect. There's always, there's actually not one rat bag here. There's not one guy that I think, oh, generally I don't like him that much. I can't say that. And they're all fellow good fellows.\n\nI got five, six plus sort of friends and, but all the others that would say, hello, how are you going? And we move around the tables when we're talking and we come different days, so we meet different guys. So we try and get to see as many fellas as we can. Yeah. Cool. And how do partners play in the mix here?\n\nIs that a thing, or is that talked about or you just leave that behind or how, oh there's the odd joke about the wife or something, [00:12:00] but no, there, there's never any, I've never heard anybody talk really badly about their partner or something. Or, if they're having marital issues, then you know that's usually done in a more sort of private, confidential, kinda way.\n\nSomeone, 'em might wanna talk to you privately if they have a, an issue with their partner. But it's joked about a little bit, but, no, I, there's no bad feeling or there's no one really is anti female, that kind of thing. It's, it all goes really well. Some partners bring their husbands, especially those that have some disabilities, but they just usually set 'em up, get 'em ready, make sure they're comfortable here.\n\nThen they'll go and sit in their car or something. So it is definitely a men's club and, since I've been coming. There's never been a woman sat down with us and not that she wouldn't be welcome, but we, yeah, it is just a Fell's club and some of the guys, not, they don't swear too much, but just the odd, the odd sort of word comes out.\n\nYeah. So [00:13:00] good. That's everything I need, but is there anything that you've always wanted to say about Tom Ned or anything else we didn't cover? No, I think you know pretty well said everything I okay. And I'm really happy here. I help out with computers, so the fellows always come and ask me or they'll contact Anthony.\n\nThere's usually a little ad that goes in the newsletter sometimes. And your computer problems talk to Anthony and he'll give him my number or whatever. And so that's part that's really enjoyable. I enjoy doing that. And I enjoy volunteering and coming. Just chatting away. Yeah. It's a it's a great, it's a really great organization.\n\nYeah. So good. I'm take Thank you. Just stay there for me.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "# Alfred Johnson\n[00:00:00] Alright, bro, just a little microphone here. Alfred Johnson. Phil, how do you spell that? A L F R E D. You just talked about it, which I think doesn't matter. Tell us where you're from, a little bit about yourself. I grew up here on Palm, back and forward, come over for the footy, Christmas. Grew up yeah, grew up back and forward from here in Townsville and down in Brisbane at the moment.\nCome back for Christmas, come up, play some footy, meet up with the boys, that's about it. Where are you from and where do you stay? Northside, in Everton Park. Yeah, Annalie Pick leaves up the coast and Yeah, I'm not too familiar with the spots, yeah. Yeah, me either. Yeah, that's [00:01:00] it.\nTell us, what do you know about Palm in terms of Beds and washers and fridges and stuff? Oh, it's the biggest muck around, to get them over. You have to bring them on the barge if you can't bring them on, you can't just take them on the boat and you have to pay for freight and stuff.\nYou can't just go down to the store and buy beds and stuff, it's hard for families and, especially over here, you won't just have a family, one family in one house. You'll have multiple families, in the one house and not everyone gets a bed, and not everyone has that place to stay.\nPapa! Yeah? There! Yeah, bed. Bed. Yeah. Thought of grabbing you? I think he's putting down that grass over there. Oh, go. Go away. Come here, baby. Yeah and Yeah, that was a really good grab there. What's do people come down to shop here, or do they get on the barge? Yeah, I think it's just sending it over.\nEveryone just comes over on the barge. I think even if you want to get bigger queen size and king size, I think they have to bring them [00:02:00] from Lucinda. And I think they have to drive to England to do that. And we have to go from Townsville, then drive up to England, then come across. It is a big mark around for beds, yeah.\nAnd what do Are you not having a bed, or having a bad bed, do you reckon? Are there knock on effects? Oh, you're gonna have a bad back, yeah, it's And having a bed is something like, you need, you can't, you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch, and then sleeping on the ground, most people do be doing that, sleeping on couches and stuff, don't have beds. And yeah, I reckon it is better to like, get more rest, and It's, yeah, it's just better. Huh, beds. And how were you rocked up and made a bed together? What was it like making it? Oh, easy. Nice, quick and easy. That's it. If I, zip ties all you need, zip them together, chuck the sheet on, you go to sleep.\nAnd you were sitting on there to lie down, what do you reckon of that comfort and that stuff? After I go for a swim, I'm going to sleep. [00:03:00] Nice and comfy, yeah. Toppers are good. You got little protectors underneath them and everything. You said easy to wash, hey? Easy. It's all you need easy to put together, easy to maintain.\nSo we're going, we've been at Kalgoorlie, Tennant, Mount Isa and stuff. What do you reckon we need to do to make sure these beds work in community for those places? Are there things that we should do to help listen or change or stuff like that? I just think not being shame, because a lot of new people, when they go to new places, they have that shame to go and ask people and sit down and talk, I just think that's one thing is you got to get that shameless out of the way and go and ask, sit down and talk to them. These boys have been doing it, you're telling me stories and that, which is good, you got to, you really got to know the family, and have that inside look of it, and that's the only way you will know if you go and approach them and ask them because they're not going to come to you. They're the same, they'll feed the same, shame to go up and ask. That's so interesting, that's one of the reflections I've been thinking about is we're going around and offering these to people and we're getting really good feedback but, like how do we make sure [00:04:00] that shame factor is not there when they see these things are not working?\nSo yeah, opening that space up. Yeah and most important question, are you gonna, you got another game today? Nah, not today, tomorrow. Tomorrow, and you're gonna win? Yeah, hopefully get a win. Are you playing? Not too sure yet. And tell us a bit about Christmas Cup while I'm here, what is it?\nIt's just a footy thing where all the communities come together. We all come play a game of footy at the end of the year and, a couple of communities come, and Cherbourg and Yarrabaugh were meant to come. And they bring the women's sides and stuff too, so everyone has a go. Yeah.\nThat's cool, bruv. Just stay there for me for one sec. I just gotta see if I can take a photo of you on the bed here. Yeah, look at me though.\nNah! Legend. Thanks bro.\n",

      "Summary": "Aunty Maureen talks about visiting Dunwich Quarry to collect materials for the roads, coral for ancestors' graves, and shells. She mentions being careful of snakes while collecting yellow daisies. The coral and shells are traditionally used on graves along with white daisies. The activity is not annual, but done periodically to clean and maintain the graves, usually around Easter, involving young people who are descendants of those buried there.",

      "Transcript": "Aunty Maureen\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nWhat's the next stop on the inquiry? Um, we're going to, uh,\n\nthe Dunwich Quarry. Where, yeah. What's that? Dunwich Quarry. Used to be an old dump. And they turned it into, the council turned it into a quarry where they throw all their sand and rocks and stuff like that. I need to put this on here. We'll need two for the roads. Main roads might. What we collecting there we're packing yellow day hurting.\n\nThe other thing we used to collect was a lot of boronia, but now it, I don't want hurt because of the bush fires. How is that better? And we just need another one to go across that place. They didn't come back. I'll ask Nick where she was,[00:01:00] \n\nwhere choice for. Oh, where is it? Oh, I can't even see it! How's the shell collecting going? The shell collecting today? Yeah, pretty good, but I don't, I don't think there's enough. Oh, really? No.\n\nBecause once you spread all that shell part on the graves, there's, there's like, 50 graves out there. So, I don't think we have enough. But, we can spread it around. Should be okay. I think this is where she wanted to go. Yeah, there's those little yellow daisies.\n\nBut I think you better be careful because it's known for snakes. I think we should let the adults go and pick those. They can hand them to you. [00:02:00] Don't walk into it. Don't walk into the bush. If you can pick ones on the outside, that's good. Nick, can you pass me another one? Thanks. Just needs to go across the other side.\n\nYou wanna hop out? Is she getting in that car, bus? It's a\n\nmedium rigid. Medium rigid. Bus license. Oh, yeah, no. Um, light, yeah.\n\nHey.\n\nIt's[00:03:00] \n\na good day for it. Lovely day for it.\n\nWhere's our first stop, Aunty Maureen? Our first stop is at the Dunwich Jetty. What's down there? That's where all, most of the coral is. It builds up there, like, been, been building up there since I ever, no one anyway, along that beach. Why are we collecting coral? Um, well the coral's for the graves, actually.\n\nFor our ancestors graves, our old cemetery.\n\nWhy, um, why is coral from the graves? Um, because that's what they used on the graves. Uh, Coral [00:04:00] and shells, mainly. And, Some small flowers like daisies. Everyone used to grow daisies. White daisies, and they used to have those in the graves as well.\n\nOh, too fast, you are.\n\nAnd have you, um, is this the first time you've done the, the script, or is it an annual thing, or is it? Um, no, not so much annual, just, just people go out and, um, clear the grave, clean them up, and usually around Easter time. Okay. To be able to\n\nhave a busload of young people doing this. Great. So they get to, um, know what, you know, went on years ago. And most of the kids, it's their ancestors that are out there.[00:05:00] \n\nA special day.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Aunty Evie\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThis is Aunty Evie. She's going to share some stories with you before we make up the posies and head up to the cemetery. So I'll give it over to Aunty Evie. Okay. Thank you. \n\n​\n\nAunty Evie: Hello everyone. Children. How are yous all today? Did you enjoy going out for flowers? Great. So I just want to share with you some little stories that when I was a little girl, And my mum used to bring me out here.\n\nWe would walk from one mile, you know where one mile is? We would walk from there and we would go. All this was bush, all overgrown. But you also know that this is where our grannies used to live and grandfathers. You know [00:01:00] all that? This was their old camping grounds long before other people came. This was their camping grounds and they called it Moongalba.\n\nAnd that's the name they preferred over Myoora. They didn't really want Myoora to be called this place. They always wanted Moongalba. But the time came when a lot of them died, our grannies and grandfathers, and you know, we're going up to the cemetery later. That's where a lot of our grannies are buried, up there on the top of the hill.\n\nAnd one of the things my mum used to do when she was young was to ride her horse from Dunwich. All the way out here to look after her grannies because they were getting old and they needed someone to help clean up their house. So my mum used to come and look after her [00:02:00] grannies that were lived here and I always enjoyed hearing her stories too.\n\nBut when she had her own family, all of her children she used to bring out here to talk about, she really didn't talk a lot. What she showed us was how and where they lived. And I remember walking from that, that, there's a lot of other mango trees over that way. The other side of the um, caravan park.\n\nThere's other mango trees down there. And we would walk down there, looking for mangoes around Christmas time. Or just after Christmas. And it was all bush. And we would come through. And there was lots of cherry trees around. And they were big cherry trees. And I used to climb up them. And eat all the cherries.\n\nWe never brought any food out. No water, because we had the food along the way. And cherries and [00:03:00] guavas were one of them. That's all we had, and plenty of water around, so we didn't have to worry about bringing bottles of water with us. But anyway, I remember pushing my way through the bush, and I saw house stumps that were there, and it reminded me of the grannies who used to live here.\n\nwhere the stumps of their house was still there. But mum said, watch out now because there might be wild pigs around. So I was a bit frightened walking through the bush. And we come this way and mum would get me to climb up the mango trees to, if she saw a mango up on the tree, she would get me to climb up and I had to get up there and shake the limb and she would be down there waiting for it to fall.\n\nAnd I remember that tree there. And if I, if that tree could talk, it'd tell you that it knew me when I was a little girl. [00:04:00] I love that. And the tree next to it, there was another big one that I looked at and I couldn't find any limbs for me to climb up. So I had to leave those other trees where I couldn't climb.\n\nBut that one on the corner? And there was the biggest, ripest mango there. And I got up there and I shook, shook, shook until it fell down. And, and there was a, another strange tree that we called a sausage tree. And one day you might get someone to show you what a sausage tree looks like. You look up on the internet and they had these big long beans.\n\nThere was only one, one tree. And sometimes that bean was shaped like this. And you know what I did? I took that bean off that tree and I carried it all the way home [00:05:00] because it had a lovely shape about it. But some of the beans were real straight. But this one had a shape. And what I did when I got home It was heavy too when I carried it all the way.\n\nBut when I got home, I put a face on it. And I wrapped it up and used it as a doll. That's lovely, eh? I never had dolls like a lot of us didn't have dolls in those days. But it did have some at one time. But that's what I used, that big bean, um, what did I call it? Um, sausage tree. I used that sausage bean for my doll.\n\nAnd that's, that, I'll always cherish that. Do yous remember, anyone remember what a sausage tree is?\n\nYeah, yes, African tree, yes, yes. Huh? Oh, you don't, [00:06:00] I\n\nnever opened it? I never opened it, so it might have had like, fleshy stuff, you know, like a fruit, like guava or something, I don't know, but um, like a pumpkin maybe.\n\nYeah, we never ate them. I didn't know if they were, if you could eat them or not. There's a tree. Did you put the Maybe you can pass it around.\n\nIs there a tree there? I saw one the other day with the tree. Sausage tree. I think that's just about the comfort. [00:07:00] If you can pass, um, my mum and others would, um, go out into the swamps, especially around springtime. Like what yous did today, gather flowers. Well, around springtime, all the baronia and heather would be out in the swamps.\n\nAnd in those days, they were thick. They were growing in all the swamps. And there was other flowers called fairy dreams. And at Christmas time, we had Christmas bells. They were beautiful, but I don't see any more. Has anyone seen Christmas bells? No.\n\nYeah. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah,\n\nI don't know. [00:08:00] But there was a patch where we used to go to where the fairy dreams were. They were a little bit different to, um, Baronia and Heather. And I hardly see them today, which is sad. Because I don't know what's gone wrong. Aunty Patsy just said,\n\nyes. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCould be. So much is happening these days.\n\nYeah. And children, before I finish. Oh, sorry Mary. Huh?[00:09:00] \n\nWhich one? Yeah.\n\nBut the fires used to regenerate them. So,\n\nyeah. Well, thanks for that. Um, before I finish off now, my mum and us used to walk out and gather the flowers and bring out big bunches of them. Brownie and Heather up here to the [00:10:00] cemetery. And I remember as a little girl, I used to rake the cemetery with the graves with my fingers. And there was fences around and mum would be leaning on the fence telling me where my grannies were up there.\n\nAnd um, I enjoyed all that. It's the way we were brought up as to our traditional way of looking and taking care of our old people even when they're gone. They're gone, but they're, they're still there to look after us and we keep in touch with them all the time. And it's a lovely thing that yous are all doing here today.\n\nThanks to the elders for doing all that. It's lovely that they're teaching yous how to look after the old people and their graves. Because that's the way we were raised. We never forget [00:11:00] them and we are very thankful for everything they did for us. They looked after us and paved the way. So, thank you for listening and have a wonderful day today.\n\nOh. Thank\n\nyou. Okay. Alright, we're going to get all the flowers that we collected now and make up some little posies to take up to the cemetery when we go up there to clean it. So, we'll put the flowers down on the mats and we've got some raffia to tie them into little bunches and some scissors to cut the raffia.\n\nSo, we'll start doing that.\n\n",

Yeah, well, I see a lot of things in the community, which I always say, you know, we talk about closing the gap, which we haven't closed no gap. The gap has actually got bigger. We do see it out there with health, homeless, people sleeping rough, overcrowded houses. You know, things have gone up where we have noticed over the months people are struggling, where they go into shopping centres, you know things have gone up where we have noticed over the months things people are struggling where they go into shopping centres you know and they've noticed like they're walking out with two bags worth 200 you know so we're seeing a lot of that stuff there um youth there's a lot of um things out there of our youth happening yeah um tell us specifically about some of the sleeping stuff you see, like some of the experiences of people where they're sleeping with a man. Yep, so we, as you know, we support Boulder Camp and Ningamoa, we take breakfast out in the morning to engage with the mob. We have people sleeping in cars, people sleeping under the bridge, people sleeping in the streets. Just to be warm as well, a lot of our mob can lay in front of the pubs and nightclubs where they've got that heat that comes out. So they'll just crash there, over in the paddocks over there. Just yeah, so people were just crashing anywhere. And what do you think one of the issues is in regards to like mattresses in terms of bacteria or what all is there? Well, like as I said, back in the days when people used to ring up, so we do have families that do come. It could be for funerals, it could be for events that are happening and they might ring up and say, oh, can we crash at your house, this is happening. So we're ringing around for mattresses. Sometimes it's, yeah, put a mattress on the roof, drive it over to the house and simple as that. But we still struggle to find mattresses because we're already using our mattresses. Mattresses aren't cheap out there. Then we, I don't even know what I was gonna say, but anyway, when COVID came in, we learnt out of COVID to be hygiene, wash our hands, keep things clean. And then when COVID sort of went out now, we still, we sort of trained ourself in that way. So now if we see, say for instance, someone might see a mattress, could we see mattresses on the side of the road when people want to tuck them out? Sometimes we're like, oh, nah, you know what I mean? Because we've learnt ourself through COVID to keep the germs away more or less. Yeah. Totally, totally. So you got to build a bed with us what's your initial reaction i guess okay so philip philip um he does our orange sky so he came this afternoon there which i yeah had a phone call news guys was in town so philip came and said tell me what you're doing i was like oh that's wicked like you know and then that's when i ended up and these guys came in and showed us. I really wanted the homeless team to see it more, is because they deal with a lot of mob that sleep rough out there. Had the staff ask a lot of questions, laid on it. But I see out of this here, it's not just like how you've made a bed, I see, you know, it's keeping people off from the ground, so snakes, whatever, keeping their chest up high, also looking at it when it got folded over. A lot of our mob, they have their personal belongings, you know, and out there, that's all our mob have. So they will treasure what they've got. And to see where you could pack it into that space area even just knowing you know what it's secured in there. So yeah but I love the idea it's a real wicked idea. I've already had a couple staff already inside, how do we get them done? So I'm just like just we just have to hold on for a minute, but yeah. And Nick said you had some feedback on washing and stuff. Is that what we're talking about? Oh, so one thing I do like about it, as I said, and that came from the COVID now, where even though you've got the bed and then the phones and the cover, lease, you can put it straight in and wash it. Where, how much would it cost if we had a big double bed or something or a single bed at the camp and to get it, keep the hygiene or to even get someone to come and wash away, it would probably cost a few hundred dollars. But at least this one here, straight in, get washed and out, yep. What do you think about this idea that we could possibly have mob run their own pet shop in community and for them to be able to create a social enterprise throughout it? Well, yeah. Yeah. Me personally, I reckon they'd love it. But then again, as I said, like, it's really good that you've got the feedback from the mob that are actually going to be – would use them. But I reckon in the communities some house as I said and even some houses we have overcrowded houses in our community as well and this could be just amazing and this you know you could pack it up and you know what I mean yeah one thing I've been thinking a lot about is not adding to the wasting community do you think there's some things we can do to make sure that people don't break these or throw them away? Well, I don't know. You don't know. Some people might think, some people will look after, as I said, because I know it's their comfort at night to lay on. You don't know. But me personally, if I was ever in that situation to be, I think I would look after because I know that's my comfort at night to sleep, to sleep comfortably at night or where I'm sleeping. Anything else you wanted to say or we've missed you? No. Just be pumped out. Just thank you. But yeah, but it's a great idea. It is a good idea. And like, you know, spending, like as I said, probably $100 or so, then spending $400, $500, $600 on a mattress. And it's, yeah, I like the idea. But as I said, the mob out there know better than what I would know, you know. Sleeping out there, yeah. But also, you can use it in houses like even though like myself to have one of these packed away in my house to all impact away I could have it packed away storage at my own house and then when I get my family visitors come down you know I could just put it put it up and that's it yeah yeah yeah\",\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Zero\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAlright, just clap my hands. Cool. So you're just looking at me. Don't worry about this thing. So just tell me your name, or name or whatever, and spell it first. Okay. Zero ZE. O Cool.\n\nI'm a musician. I'm an artist. I studied psychology at university. I live on the streets. I've been, yeah, I've been staying in tents. I've been staying at shelter and in hostels for the past two years. It's an adventure.\n\nOrange Sky's great. They're really helpful because just the practical things whilst your houseless, like trying to do your laundry can be a challenge. So the fact that you guys come out to the locations.\n\nNear day space and near the Uniting Church. That's where people get free food. For those who don't know, it's really helpful. It's really helpful just being able to do your laundry whilst you're doing everything else in the day. It's just, it's one more thing that we don't have to worry about. So it's appreciated and volunteers and connection and communication and stuff.\n\n[00:01:00] If isolation is like the struggle of modern society, then connection to communities, the antidote.\n\nI think it's practical. It's practical, more so than anything. It's awesome. Also it speaks to what people that are living on the streets need in a wider sense is access to facilities . There's two types of facilities that would benefit from having community access to the first is necessary.\n\nUtilities like kitchen, shower, laundry. 'cause there aren't spaces where you can just go to do those necessary living function things for free. And the second, third space that would be amazing to see more so in the community is free spaces just to be and to build community from, for example a clothing exchange, like free clothing exchange, a place with couches, with a kitchen, with a lounge, just to hang out during the daytime.\n\nA place where there's a free bookshelf, a place that [00:02:00] encourages free trade. 'cause if you can facilitate an environment where people can help people, that's the best way to solve things. Most people are generous especially people that are in difficult situations. You'll see a lot of compassion because it's valued and we know how far, like a little help goes when things are rough. So if we could have spaces that are built around that mentality of give a little, get a little, a free space with facilities, that's what would really help in this situation. Built specifically, not so much around the idea of charity.\n\nAround community, around free trade, around art, around sharing knowledge and just helping each other.\n\nSo a great example of this that we need to see more of is street to stage. So I dunno if you know what that is. No. So street to stage is, it's run the past two years. The first was at Simple Sider and the second was.\n\nYouth arc. And so it was an opportunity for [00:03:00] people that had experienced houselessness or were currently experiencing houselessness to get up and play music or do poetry on stage. And that was so awesome 'cause it was bringing together people and sharing stories around a shared passion for music, which was so cool.\n\nAnd the energy was great. Oh, by the way, this is another point. The term homelessness. Is inaccurate. It should be houselessness because anybody who's in the situation understands the difference between a house and a home. House, four walls home, that feeling of love, and you can have that sense of home with you if you have community wherever you are, and if you have connection to the earth and to yourself, that's home.\n\nA house, just a place, so nobody can actually judge another being to say that they are homeless because that is something that we determine for ourselves. So I would say that I'm houseless. I don't have a house, but I am home wherever I go. I think that's important that we should change the language around that to better reflect the [00:04:00] situation as opposed to.\n\nAnd reduce the stigma a little bit. We're all people of this planet, who is anyone to say that anyone is homeless? Are we not still just beings altogether? There's no difference. It's no difference.\n\nRight now, in order to get access to those things for free people in this situation need to access them. At specific places at specific times, which can be a little bit inconvenient if you've got like a busy schedule or if you have work or all of those different things.\n\nSo it'd be great to have more free access hubs and also third spaces. To relax because in a heavily capitalistic society, there's emphasis on doing in all places. There's always a function, there's always an economic exchange. Whereas if we had places where it was accepted just to be and to exist. We could facilitate connections and friendships growing more organically and strengthen the community that way, as opposed to it being like, okay, you're in this spot to buy a [00:05:00] coffee.\n\nNobody talks to each other. This look at the phone. No. If it was just a place where we could all just be, that's, I think that would actually help the spirit of the city free spaces.\n\nStarting with the man in the mirror, like we lead by example and if each of us becomes the best we can be.\n\nThat's the true way to see the world get better, individuals making a difference in their own lives and that rippling out to see awesome change in the community.\n\nI don't know the gentleman personally, but from my experience with Orange Sky, it was a brilliant idea and keeping community at the core.\n\nOf any service is the way to keep a good vibe. Let them know. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nI really want a motorbike. That's my big, that's cool. Yeah, because once I have a motorbike, I can camp and I'll be the cool kind of houseless, not the street kind of houseless like Yeah. I don't know. [00:06:00] It's difficult also, if you've been living day to day for a while, just dealing with existence and the fundamentals.\n\nIf there isn't really a foundation, it's really difficult to actually plan ahead. When anybody asks me about the future, I'm like that doesn't exist. No, tomorrow. That does not exist.\n\nThere's several ways that I think that I can help and like conversations like these, if I have an idea. I wanna share that with the world, like more third spaces or letting you guys know about the issue with the hostels and stuff.\n\nSo here we go. Here's some knowledge I've learned, pass it on. But also self-improvement and being mindful in the way that I show up in day-to-day interactions with people and trying to just be kind. Which sounds simple, but I feel is huge. And also I'm thinking like music and art, definitely ideas are powerful.\n\nSpreading ideas is powerful, but the groundwork and just helping people out is also powerful and important. [00:07:00] It's all equally important, but what I'd like to do is make music so good that it just changes the world and makes everybody realize that the concept of housing is absurd and everything should be free and we can all live in peace.\n\nAnd I'll write a song that powerful and beautiful that everyone finally realizes that and then everything will be peaceful. There you go. That's my world domination plan. That's pretty, yeah, that's, yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah, I can, yeah, I'd love to hear that song. Yeah, me too. I'm still working on it.\n\nWhat, you got a particular. Genre of music you like more than others to play or to do? It depends on my mood. Like I do piano, guitar, singing, and electronic. So a bit of everything. Yeah. That's diverse. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Let's go take a photo. Cool.\n\n",

My family's country is from Emily to Jesse, gap all the way down behind the airport, and I've grown up all over Australia.\n\nMy dad was a minor, so we moved, lived in every state pretty much, but we always would come back to Alice and I always had a strong sense of. Justice in my life, not necessarily as a child, defining it as justice, but when I reflect back on my childhood, I always had this sense of things needing to be just and fair and equal for people.\n\nAnd when I got to year 12 and all that pressure to put something on a [00:01:00] university application I actually. Got offered a position at n which is the Acting and Performing Arts in Queensland. 'cause I went to boarding school in Queensland in Charters Towers. And I threw that aside and wrote law on my uni application.\n\nMuch, much to my drama, despair. I remember she criticized me heavily for that. We had a big argument 'cause I had in my mom had said to me, you can't be an actor because being an actor is all about luck. You gotta be in the right place at the right time. It's not sustainable. So I ended up putting law.\n\nAnd I got into an Aboriginal pre-law program at the University of Western Australia, which I know seems a bit odd. So my family's in the non territory. I was at boarding school in Queensland and I got into university in wa 'cause my Nan lives over there. So I had applied to go over there. And so I got into a pre-law program at UWA.[00:02:00] \n\nWhich I went and did and then got into law school, which was the last year that you could do a straight law degree. So I didn't do a double degree, I just did a straight law degree, which on reflection, I wish I had done two degrees really? 'cause I think it gives you more opportunity and, but I did straight law.\n\nBattled my way through a law degree. I think I got to my third year and I told my parents I was quitting and going up to the Pilbara to be a truck driver in the mines. 'cause I heard how they were earning like $150,000 a year and my dad being a minor was like, you're not doing that. So I pulled my way through my law degree and then I at the end of law.\n\nBecause it was a big deal coming from the NT and going to UWA. I think I remember my first day, and if I know if you've been to UWA, but it's very like grandiose old school. Oh, senior outside university. Very, [00:03:00] and I remember the first day I walked through the tunnel and I was like. Where am I? I was like walking on another planet.\n\nI didn't, feel like I belonged. Spent most of my time at the Aboriginal Student Center and just hung out with all the other Aboriginal students. Never really got into uni life, if so when it was coming up to final year law and everyone was applying for the big law firms like Minter Ellison and, going for these big corporate firms and stuff, I was a bit like, I don't really.\n\nKnow what I want to do. That's not really what I envision myself doing. It's not my sort of people or anything. And this opportunity came through the Aboriginal Student Center. The Supreme Court of Victoria was looking for an indigenous associate. It was the first time they'd ever done role that was a dedicated indigenous associate judges associate role.\n\nI was like, oh, that sounds interesting. Get to go live in Melbourne. And so I applied and I got the job. So I moved all the way [00:04:00] to Melbourne. I'd never lived in Melbourne or been to Melbourne in my life, and I had an amazing judge who was my supervisor in the Supreme Court, and I got to work.\n\nWith heaps of judges. 'cause I was like a roaming associate. So I got to work in crime, civil tax corporations, all the different areas that Supreme Court does, and I had an amazing experience. My judge really reinvigorated me. To want to be a lawyer and practice law. I was part of the Indigenous Lawyers Association and we actually did the case against Andrew Bolt for racial vilification.\n\nWe ran that matter when he did the article saying that where he had photos of fair skinned Aboriginal people and he was saying that they weren't black enough basically to, so we ran a. Case with a pro bono law firm against him, and we won when I was there. So that was a really [00:05:00] wonderful experience.\n\nAnd then one day when I was in Melbourne, I'd been there about a year. I was getting on the tram and, all the people were like rushing and I just had this moment where I went, I need to go home. It just really. It hit me. I just went, I can't stay here anymore. This isn't, I need to go back to my home and to my community and use this law degree.\n\nSo I think I resigned two weeks later and I came home and it was the first time in my life driving from the airport into Alice. 'cause when you grow up in Alice or. You are like, oh, as a kid, oh, I hate Alice. All this stuff. But it was the first time in my life as I was driving in from the airport and I saw the Rangers and I went, wow, it's really beautiful here.\n\nSo yeah, it was the first time I had that realization. Came home, I got a job at a private firm in town. [00:06:00] Hated it. I became like the Alice Springs Debt recovery lawyer. So people at like netball games would be like, Hey, I got a letter from you. And I was, but I was also doing some child protection work.\n\nSo the law, the law firm I was working for, they were representing the child in a lot of matters. So I was doing a lot of that work as well. Didn't enjoy it. Hated billable hours. My boss was a real nutcase and the first job that I saw, Aboriginal legal aid advertising, I was like, I'm gonna go for it.\n\nAnd it was a community legal education lawyer and I got the job. Who? And Auntie Pat. Who's Uncle Tony. And that's sister. She was the CEO there. She knew my family and loved that job. I did community legal education. Plus I was a civil family and child protection lawyer, so I did both roles and absolutely loved it.\n\nI was going out Bush every second week. I'd [00:07:00] be often, under a gumtree teaching people about their rights and the legal system and at the same time doing civil law and stuff like that. So I did that for five years. And I ran the National Indigenous Legal Conference that Alice Springs hosted.\n\nI project managed that while I was there. And then my mom had moved down south 'cause she couldn't afford land here and she wanted to have land and horses and stuff. And so after five years I thought I might go down south for a bit just to spend time with her. And I got a job as a family dispute resolution practitioner.\n\nSo I became a qualified FDRP, which is basically a mediator for family law. You've gotta be registered. And I did that for another four and a half years. I ran an office in Port Perie and I'd consider myself that I was a very good mediator. I had a 95% [00:08:00] success rate and I really loved it. But after that amount of time.\n\nI was burnt out from it because you take on, as a lawyer, you just take on your clients, but as a mediator you take on the whole family. And I really wore me down over time. So then I come back, went to Naja, back with Christie. We did law and policy, CLE stuff and then the family court. And that's when we started talking about we need to do.\n\nSomething for ourselves. Like we've gotta stop working, grinding away. So yeah, that's a long story, but that's so awesome how I got, all I can say is that if he asked me back when I was at law school what I would've done with my law degree, I never would've envisioned that I would've done the things that I did.\n\nThat's for sure. I've just taken opportunities and rolled with it, so interesting but the feeling is not liking something and going changing, [00:09:00] but then when you look back, how awesome it is to have that like different experience Yeah. That you take with you. At uni I didn't even do family law because it's an elective.\n\nI didn't even do family law and then I became a family, basically a family lawyer and an FDRP. That's the crazy part about it. What's what's this like. Country or place mean to you in terms of, you said that like you had a different feeling when you came back and that different connection is that something that continues to develop and Yeah.\n\nHow do you, like old fellas are talking today about, one of the things they find disappointing is that there's no respect for. Different people's country anymore, everyone's just drifting in and out and like feeling like they own this place. What's that experience like for you and your connection between two sort of countries, yeah. I think, there's no doubt about it, Alice has [00:10:00] changed significantly over time, especially since the intervention, the. But I've always felt like a strong connection to Alice, even though as a young person, I didn't appreciate the beauty. I've always, this has always been our home base.\n\nWe'd go away here, there in a robot. We always would come back to Alice. And so I feel that very strongly that connection to this place like this has always been home no matter where we've been. I think it is unfortunate that, in Alice Springs that it's not just Aboriginal people who have lost that respect for country, but that, we have a lot of people in our town now, and Alice has grown very quickly, but the majority of people don't know our story here.\n\nThey don't know the history, they don't know the story of Alice. They don't [00:11:00] know. The Aboriginal story, the white story, the mix of stories, both good and bad people are just existing in this place, but unless you know the story, how can you have empathy or connection to the place is my thing. Like when Christian and I were at Flinder's, we would do this cultural awareness training for all NT health staff.\n\nAnd we would often have people come in and, I've lived in Alice for 20 years, lived in Alice for 30 years, blah, blah, blah. And then we'd do the session, which covers history and all these different topics. And by the end, they would be crying because I'd be like, I've lived here this entire time and I had no idea that this was what went on.\n\nAnd 'cause we all know, despite what Jacinta says. That history makes up your present. The history does affect the present and it, even just hearing from those people saying, I understand a bit more now. I can [00:12:00] see where the issues are coming from. I can, so I think that's an unfortunate part of where we're at here as well.\n\nIt's not freely open and spoken about, but I guess that's Australia wide. We don't acknowledge our history and. I think Queensland was gonna do the truth telling inquiry, but then that got canned. 'cause I don't think it's about trying to make people feel bad, it's just about acknowledging that this is something that happened and this is what has gotten us to where we are.\n\nSo let's all work together to build from that. I definitely I walk straight down and there's that big brick thing in the middle and you walk up and it says. Some fucking person came here through here. Yeah. And he had a heroic journey and they had to put a park there. And then you walk up the road a bit and there's that fucking hero Bushman or something.\n\nOh, you saw this? The statue. Yeah. And I was like, fucking cool. Another big statue. And then you could see there's people's [00:13:00] camps underneath the white man holding the gun. Yep. Yeah. And it's like a very visceral moment for me. And then yeah, talking to those old followers about what life was like before and especially there's some complicated history there.\n\nBut what sort of gets me, I don't know if we've got this right or not, but in between those two points from then and now, there's been some shit go down. Yeah. And everything's gone pache for some reason. Yeah. Is there a certain sort of way in which you have to, I. Both. I understand that, but then look after the present kids and have you learned how to do that?\n\nOr is this, is that like something you're still trying to work out? Like how can you acknowledge that middle, crunchy, horrible bit and then say to the kids, you can get out of that. You don't have to. Yeah. I think that, how I see it is learning and acknowledging that stuff informs how you go forward.\n\nBecause those kids don't understand, know the history, [00:14:00] they don't know what's going on. But in it informs you to have a greater understanding of the broader context in which you're working in. And I find, like Christine and I use that all the time, that background of knowledge and understanding and, 'cause even when we started at Flinder's, we learnt some of that stuff for the first time.\n\nAs well, and it immediately changed the way that we look at things or talk about things or how we decide we want to do things. Because education is power, right? Knowledge is power. That's how I see it impacting what we do. What's they what's what's the way have you found to be able to explain what in trauma does?\n\nServices you do, is there, have you found a way to do that easily or is it something you're always still working at? \n\nDepending who I'm talking to. Like your everyday person. I explain it that we work with the most high risk young people in Central Australia and our role is. Twofold.\n\nIt's [00:15:00] as a cultural broker, so to link them and empower them in their identity as an aboriginal person, make them feel strong in that. Make them feel proud of their identity and ensure that their connection to their identity as an aboriginal person is maintained. And then the other aspect is to bridge the gap for them between that aspect of who they are and the western world.\n\nSo helping them to. Access education and health and all the things which other kids in town take for granted. Like we have a program in the NT where you get a sports voucher from the government, so it's a hundred dollars each semester that you can use to pay for your club fees for footy and things like that.\n\nYeah, and most kids, their parents just fill that out and do it, but it, our young people can't, don't even have someone who can go online and fill out a form for a sports voucher. So it's just giving them access to what everyone else has access to, but also linking them to the [00:16:00] community and making them feel a part of something that they're not outsiders looking in.\n\nThat's cool. What's a moment with a young person that has represented what you're trying to do? Is there something that's happened do you think that stands out as that's fucking really good outcome that you think about often? Yeah, I think, there's been a few I think the young girl that we worked with who had, a lot of, a range of issues including severe mental health and behavioral issues.\n\n\\*\\*Ben:\\*\\* And now you look at her and she's got a job out in community and she's really got her independence and her life together. She's living out there and that kind of thing. That's a, was a huge success because. Everyone else had given up on her, basically. We had a young fellow who went out on country with us and after having that experience and seeing us, sharing knowledge with kids from interstate, he went back to his mob and now does the same thing with his [00:17:00] community.\n\nWelcoming people from overseas and interstate and sharing his. Knowledge and culture and so empowering them in that way. That's cool. Obviously you're in a different head space now after being in a meeting and knowing that there's something coming. What's the what do you see as the everyday things that you hope to be able to do differently if you know that there's.\n\nResources available. Is there, are there certain things that you, 'cause there's always a thing Nick and I always talk about. It's like we run it trying to get paid for something or funding, and then you get the money and it's does any change? Yeah. What's the sort of everyday stuff you hope that you can continue to do better or build on?\n\nYeah. I think, in terms of our operating the program, I think. Build on our database and our data collection making that more efficient because I think, 'cause we've been in this sort of we won't we've just [00:18:00] been going along doing spreadsheets and things as best we can. But I think getting a better form of data collection we'll be important, a more efficient form for our staff as well.\n\nBut, I think. If we know, and obviously this is all an if, because we don't actually know what it is they're offering us, they're gonna offer us something. But what is it? If it's something that's a little bit more long term, I think it will just loosen the reins. I think. We'll feel free to dream again because I think we've felt so confined and constricted by.\n\nCome June, do our staff all need to look for new jobs? Do we need to go? Do I have to go back to Flinders Uni? Like it hasn't allowed us to, while we have all these ideas, we hasn't allowed us to really dream them because everything's just been like treading water, I guess is the best way to describe it.\n\nSo I feel like if we have the knowledge that [00:19:00] we have some long-term security, we can really throw ourselves into. All right, what are, what's our goals? And now we can actually work to achieving those things. There's gonna be a bunch of randos coming up in June for this reintegration conference, and there'll be everyone from policy to a bunch of ex-prisoners to like impact data people, whatever.\n\nIf they get a chance to understand what's happening here, what would you hope that they take away? To understand Alice Springs and also what you were trying to do, what you, I think you know, anyone who visits, we try to get them to see the real Alice because the media paints a certain picture and it's a really bleak picture of Alice Springs.\n\nAnd our thing is yes, there are negatives in our town, but there's also all these great positive things. And we, our big thing is well, [00:20:00] let us show you the negative and the positive, and at least that way when you see a media, article about Alice Springs, you can actually form an make an informed opinion about what is actually going the truth behind what's going on in our town.\n\nAnd hopefully that opinion is informed by a little bit of empathy for the people that the media's portraying as well. There's a whole bunch of stuff happening in every community. Some of the things are like very similar and like visceral in terms of what's happening in Alice Springs and some of it's different.\n\nIf, do you do you see yourself trying to work out how you can. Understand what other places are doing and even visit and share that knowledge. And do you think that's helpful, yeah, absolutely. When we first started, these talks with NIAA, that was even a huge thing from their perspective because this was a pilot program.\n\nThe idea is if it works, [00:21:00] which we believe we've shown it does work, is to be able to take the similar ideas and concepts national and share it with other. Not just aboriginal groups, but groups in general this way of doing, especially aboriginal groups with that leadership and cultural authority.\n\nSo yeah, we love sharing and that cross knowledge base and things like that as well. And then going even broader had to go overseas, going to visit diagram. What do you think if they were looking at coming to Australia and thinking about how. Any of their model can translate.\n\nWhat sort of tips do you think you have for them in terms of how they best come to a community and offer what they have? Like how's the best process to happen and what do you think could happen from that? In terms of like good shared outcomes? Yeah. In those ways? Yeah. You'd obviously target, initially you'd wanna target a specific.\n\nCommunity. 'cause all of our [00:22:00] communities, while they have similar issues, we're also all very quite different. And I've looked at, read a lot about that model and stuff since talking to you and it'll be great to be able to bring some of that knowledge and ideas and I think, while we're all in this idea of justice reinvestment and alternatives to justice and things like that, it's a great opportunity to start having these conversations and putting some of these ideas on the table.\n\nI definitely think you, it's a twofold thing. Obviously community, you can get on board and talk with community and consult and share ideas and thoughts. But I guess as we know in Australia, then you've gotta deal with the political. The political aspect of how that could work or what we could do to implement that or pilot program where maybe it's run by an Aboriginal group as a pilot program or something, as a [00:23:00] diversion option or how you could scale it down initially to sell it and then.\n\nYou go, all right, let's tackle it on the larger scale. That's really good. Yeah. On the same sort of point an idea is there's indigenous groups everywhere around the world. How do you think we start to share those marginalized perspectives and almost think about what's the things that are.\n\nShared knowledges and practices and stuff we can bring into Australia and yeah, I guess how do it's almost like that two worlds thing again. It's like how do you cut through this thing of indigenous knowledges can be part of this new modern Yeah. Academic and practice thing.\n\nHow do we make sure that those historical know stay part of the practice? Yeah, I think about this quite a bit because I've always been quite internationally minded in terms of sharing knowledge and experience [00:24:00] and I often think about the only time I know that there are small pockets of indigenous groups sharing knowledge on specific things, but.\n\nWhen you think about the only time as indigenous people that were actually brought together to share knowledge on a global is at the un. And that's an intense space. And really a lot of the time it's just a talk fest. Like it nothing, you don't really hear much coming out of the indigenous people sessions of the un, other than people just going and sharing their story, but no real policy or.\n\nGreat big declarations come out or anything like that from those events. Finding ways that we can create these groups where we have these annual abilities to come together and talk about these things and create statements or things which actually [00:25:00] cause global traction.\n\nBecause I think at the moment. As indigenous people globally, we talk between ourselves and we create things within ourselves, but the rest of the world doesn't take notice. It's just something that we are left to figure out on our own kind of thing. Yeah, I feel like, especially in Australia it's yeah, the Olympics and they were like, a few people saw some people dancing around.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And that's kind of it. Yeah. And like I'm always fascinated when you go to. Like being in Asia or being in the Middle East or something and the amount of knowledge people have around, yeah, indigenous groups is like a boomerang or fucking a Yeah. And it's fascinating 'cause when I've gone to America just for a holiday, I specifically sought out the opportunity to go meet other indigenous people and hear about.\n\nAnd I think that's what indigenous people globally do. Like we seek each other out because we wanna share knowledge and, but there's [00:26:00] not that stage for those conversations to become like, alright, as a global group, this is what we want. The world, this is a best practice or this is, how things should be done.\n\nThere's start this again. There's. I feel like there's a massive tension between white people feeling like they have to go through some kind of process or ceremony versus this is an exchange of knowledge and information. Yeah. It's fucking the thing that I get upset about most, I think is it turns into what someone forcing you to do.\n\nYeah. Versus how do you best understand Yeah. And I don't think I'll ever have to understand. Yeah. But that's where we talk about allies, right? It's about letting Aboriginal people lead, but being an ally on the side to, whereas I think in [00:27:00] Australia we've got that upside down completely, we're not, we're given the opportunity to be consulted with, but you're never given the opportunity. Or we are a little bit now, but it's rare that you're consulted with and then told, Hey. So from that consultation we came up with this, do you wanna do it? It'll be like, oh, from the consultation we came up with this and we've brought in this group to do that for you now.\n\nIt's awesome. To, that sort of leads me to this last question, which is just been fascinated at your journey so far, and. Like what you've been able to achieve and what's this like? I think the thing in which I've realized the most is that there is still a lot of influence in how you are able to control what you can do.\n\nAnd there's a lot of people coming in and operating in a sense of experts or ownerships or whatever. What's this like [00:28:00] in five years, what would you hope that you are able to. Be acknowledged as and being able to almost take back some of those things that are being forced upon you.\n\nWhat does that look like in maybe five years to to think about whether it's from Cho or Alice or whatever? I would hope that we would be at the forefront of change. And not just for young people, but for Alice as a place. To bring it back to that vibrant, multicultural, accepting community that we did once have with the youth, I hope that, 'cause we're doing this research project at the same time that we're able to set some best practice.\n\nThrough that research and to be able to share with the rest of our community across Australia. This is what works and this is how you do [00:29:00] it with Aboriginal young people. But I think my vision is that, yeah, we're able to help bring our town back and that's why we started. This is 'cause we care about Ban as a place.\n\nOur young people, unfortunately, are just collateral in a bigger issue. The issue doesn't sit with them. It sits on a much broader level and with adults, not with children. \n\n\\*\\*Tanya:\\*\\* Working towards how we as an Aboriginal community bring back our lives, create something for our people to want to live for.\n\nBecause I think at the moment our people really have nothing. To drive them. There's a lot of sadness and despair and hopelessness, all compounded by racism and alcoholism and domestic violence and all these things. And it's about us working together all our different language groups. [00:30:00] To go, let's take back our lives.\n\nThis isn't a way to live. We can't keep living like this, and become members of this community and lead this community in the way that we know we can fuck Sarah. Anything else I missed you think that you wanted to make sure you said No? I think that's good. So rad.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Hello hello hello can you hear me? Yeah, well I can't but I can see you talking. This is the first time I've had this set up. It's a great setup. It's really cool. It's handy. It's very easy to set up. It's not when you're a one-man band. Yep. Right, Rala, you're looking at me. I'll sit here. Yep. Look at my eyes, I'll get my line. Right. Cool, Rala. Just do your name. I just like, I don't know if that's like, is that? Oh yeah, that's fine. Yep. Just do your name and spell it. It'll be awesome. Okay, Matthew Neal. And M-A-T-T-H-E-W-N-E-I-L-L. Cool. I reckon we just continue on from the yarn we were just having about how you met Nick and stuff. That'd be a cool place to start, I think. Yeah, so. How did you meet Nick and how did you start? Yeah, for sure. So I was lucky enough to attend a conference with my licensee. I run a financial planning business and they ran a licensee conference over in Shanghai and the boys actually came and did a presentation that day. And one of the most moving, touching things I think I've had at one of these events was hearing the boys articulate their story and this story about connection and connecting with people, which, you know, on the surface you think laundry and you think, you know, helping the homeless and those sorts of things. But what I took from it was this ability to connect and the impact you have connecting with people, which I think, you know, that really sort of grabbed me at the time and hence being here today as a volunteer. Cool. And so before that, what was your perception of homelessness and the idea of helping people? I guess in that situation? I think you don't really know. I think I knew it was a problem. I originate from Melbourne, moved up to Mackay sort of a while ago, and it's a massive problem down there, I know. But I think you can, you know, there's a lot of stigma that gets attached to people that are homeless. And I think unless you actually spend the time and get to know them and understand them and hear the stories, you don't really actually understand. I think, yeah, certainly coming to Orange Sky gives me that sense of understanding and knowing, not just this outside perception or listening to the dogma or the stigma that you hear in the community. Yeah, right. And I guess, like, tell us a little bit about your, like, history. You've been in Mackay for a while, or you moved around, and what sort of stuff did you get up to around? Yeah, financial advisor. So I run a business locally. Yeah, so we support lots of different, you know, charities and do lots of sort of sponsorship and things like that locally. But moved up here from Mackay, from Melbourne, sorry, 10 years ago. So I started a business and young family. Wife sort of runs her little shop as well. And then, yeah, two young boys just starting embarking on school. So, yeah, it's a busy, busy time. And what keeps you in Mackay? Like, is it something that's like a community thing or business thing? Community, mate. 100%. Yeah, I grew up in a community in Melbourne. This is a much tighter, tight-knit community in Mackay. I think you really know your neighbour. And I think that's something that you can miss in the big city, I think, you know, whereas here, you know, you're not going to be able to get a job in the big city. You know, you're going to have to get a job in the big city. think, you know, whereas, whereas here, you know, you can foster those relationships. It's got everything you need locally. Beautiful place to live, great climate, great people. Yeah, no complaints. And how does that carry over to what you do here? I guess, like, some people, the people that come here, I guess, are missing something, whether it's like a loneliness thing, or a practical thing. What's, how does that feel to be able to like, like, be here every week and know that that's the reason you're here, I guess? Yeah, I think it's easy to give your money and donate and donate your money and your funds. It's a lot different when you start to donate your time. And you can actually see the change you're actually having a part of, as opposed to, you know, handing over some money and a cheque and, and not quite knowing what that's going to do or what they're going to do with that. I think it's, it's being at the coalface, actually seeing and seeing the impact you're having on people just through connections and hearing their stories. So I think, a massive part of what I've done is I've been able to see how people are changing, and I think that's a really, really important part of what I'm doing. Yeah, I think it's, it's a really, really important part of what I'm doing. And I think, I think, so I think, massive part of what I like to do is, is community, community based and community oriented. So, so for me, it's just a natural, natural progression of that is spending the time. That's cool. So you're a financial advisor, and I guess you know a lot about like, value and economics and things. Yeah. There's, what do you think like the, the impact is of Iron Sky, not just on the personal and the engagement, but like, on a scale where it's more around value? Like, how do you think that Orange Sky supports Australia and New Zealand and stuff with value? Yeah, I think, I think the value it has is that it, you know, clearly, it gets people out of their house, gets people talking to other people, gets people using services they wouldn't otherwise have actually knew were around. Talking to the people here that support us and provide the food services. Just those two, two services working together is what draws people in, makes them aware of what Orange Sky can do for them. You know, you don't actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually, you can actually have this service where you can talk to people, have an outlet, have a social experience with, with people that you wouldn't otherwise interact with. But it's all because of this joint collaboration between, you know, two really great organisations and it's having a huge impact on people locally. That's cool. And what about the impact for people like yourself, I guess, like, um, thousands of volunteers around Australia from all walks of life. What do you think the value is to like a society, um, for people, for that to be a thing you can do? Sense of purpose, mate. Um, I think, um, I think, um, I think, um, I think, um, I think, um, I think, um, I think everyone's looking to connect with people, but for me, it was just a massive, you know, sense of purpose. You know, you've got your work, your family, you can play a bit of sport on the weekends, but for me, I wanted to find that sort of deeper sense of purpose. Why am I here? Why do I do what I do? Um, can I have a bigger impact than just turning up every day and going to work and spend time with mates and family? Can I make a bigger impact and have a greater sense of being and sense of purpose? And I think for me, that's the biggest thing I get out of Orange Sky. That's cool. And if someone's like standing on the fence there looking at Orange Sky and thinking, maybe I want to volunteer, maybe I don't, what do you think would get them over the line? What's something that you would say to them to get them to come? I think if you enjoy spending time with people and you enjoy talking to people and getting to know them and understand and listen, um, and you, and you have those, that, that ability and have those skills, then put them to use and give it a go is what I'd say. Um, you know, there's, there's no harm in, in trying these things. Um, it's a very, um, welcoming community is how I, how I found it. Um, your teammates are supportive. The friends you meet have all got different stories and different backgrounds. And I just find that incredibly exciting and incredibly, um, I just enjoy it, um, fundamentally. And so I'll keep turning up and, um, I hope other people will join me. So good. Mate, good ending. That's all right. That was a good little, uh, box pop there, I reckon. Nah, good man.\n",

      "Transcript": "Alright, recording on one of them, recording on the other. I don't know why I make this so hard on myself. Um, actually, what I'll do, I'll make sure you're crispy sharp, because I haven't done that. Oh, that's crispy as I reckon. Alright, now Orp and Lou want to leave you there. That's alright, I'll come back. Okay. Just need to make sure I'm not, um, I'm reading my notes. Otherwise, Kate will do it. Recording, recording, we're rocking. Is the sitting here okay? Yeah, mate, that's all good. Being a one-person band sucks sometimes. Alright, I'd rather just say your name and spell it for me. It'd be awesome. Luke Watkins, oh, yeah, sorry, mate. Nah, it's sweet. Luke Watkins, L-U-K-E-W-A-T-K-I-N-S. Cool. And, um, just like tips, I don't know if you need tips, but, um, it's awesome, like, if I ask you a question, if you repeat the first part of that question. Okay. So, like, if I say what you have for breakfast, you'll say, for breakfast, I can. Okay, yep. And, like, it just helps with, like, the editing and recording and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, it's super, super helpful. Uh, cool. So, tell us a little bit about your experience. Yeah. So, tell us a little bit about, um, how you first found out about Orange Sky. I first found out about Orange Sky, it was actually through my mum. Um, so she does some work over at the church, um, and she deals with some affected people, uh, in the area, and they all pretty much had good things to say about, um, what you guys do here, what happens here. Um, so, yeah, I decided I'd come over. I'd turned 18 years old, so I'd tried to sign up before then, but you have to be 18 years old to do it. So, when I was 18, came over, gave it a shot, and loved it. So, I've moved around a few different shifts, and just being able to talk to people, and they call it volunteering, I've, I love it. So, um, and yeah, just, just get a help them out however that you can, whether that's giving some advice, or just, you know, doing their laundry for them, or if they just want to have a chat, it's, it's awesome. So cool. Um, tell us a little bit about, like, Mackay, I guess. Like, what's, what's Mackay feel like to you as a, as a Mackay resident? For me, Mackay is actually my second home. So, I was born over in the States. And we moved over here when I was two years old. So, I, this is pretty much most of what I remember. Um, but yeah, this is, this has been home. It's been awesome to me. Um, I only have good things to say about the place. Um, and I love, yeah, working here. I'm going to uni here at the moment. Um, and just, yeah, it's been, just trying to, yeah, give back to the community that's already given so much to me. So, yeah. So cool. And you talked a little bit about, like, conversation. What's it mean to sort of sit down and, you know, talk about it? What's it mean to sit down and go out of your way to come and, and speak to someone who, like, I suppose appreciates and, and is here for that? Like, how does that feel for you? And what sort of, what sort of conversations sort of come up, I guess? Yeah, well, it doesn't feel like going out of my way at all. Um, just feels like you're having a chat to a mate. Um, and the things we talk about, it can be anything. It can be real serious conversations if they're, you know, struggling or having some hard stuff going on. But most of the time, it's just general conversation. They just want to know. They just want to be treated like a friend, like a normal person. They're more than happy to do that. They're great people to talk to. Everyone has their own story. Um, and it, it makes me feel awesome to, you know, make them feel heard, um, and genuinely, you know, enjoy and listen to their stories. So, yeah, it makes me feel really good. And what about yourself? Like, um, outside of Orange Sky, what's, what's your current life and what are you, what are you doing at the moment? So, I'm currently studying engineering full time. Um, but I'm also working at Hay Point, which is a coal terminal. And then also at an engineering workshop in town. Um, and then doing some study sessions through the uni and then also tutoring on the side of that. So, yeah, keeping pretty busy. Wow. Um, done. Far out. Yeah. Um, and do you, I suppose, was there a close connection with this idea of home lessons before you started or was it something that was quite, um, abstract and not very close to you as a, as a person or as? Um, in Mackay, it wasn't something I was too exposed to. Every now and then I used to always go fishing. Um, and sometimes down along Pioneer River, you would see, um, some people camping out and sleeping there. Um, but it never really went beyond that here in Mackay. It was over in the States that I saw it most, cause we would go over every year to visit family. Um, and going to Phoenix, Arizona, you'd see a lot of it. So we'd always make a point of bringing some bread around and some sandwiches and whatnot whenever we went anywhere. Um, and just dropping it off to people and trying to talk to them, basically what you guys are doing here. Um, and I loved it. It was great. So yeah, and I'd realised how much people lit up, not just when you gave them food, but when you actually talked to them, treated them as you would anyone else. It, yeah, it, it felt good even back then. So. On that point, like, um, Orange Sky provides a service. Um, it also provides a connection. Um, there's a lot of vehicles out there. There's a lot of vehicles, I guess, around Australia and New Zealand at the moment. What, like bringing all that together, what do you think, um, is the impact of Orange Sky? Like what do you think in general is the impact of Orange Sky? Oh, it's huge. Um, look, it does help. Like the immediately obvious stuff is people get clean clothes, people get some food, people get some water and people get access to any help they need. Like they'll, you know, get told where they can find help for a specific problem they're having. Um, and then they'll just want to talk to us about some general stuff. Um, and yeah, the, the biggest thing for me though is just them being heard, them being talked to, them being treated like just anyone else. Um, and I think, I guess I haven't really specifically asked people how it's changed them and I'm probably not in the best position to say this is how it's helped them. Um, but yeah, I just, yeah, I'm not, not completely sure on that one. I like to think it helps them in just about every aspect. Um, but yeah. Yeah. Cool. Is there, is there any particular like person or story that you've heard since you've been here that stands out for you in terms of like a conversation or a friend or a situation that's happened before? Yeah, you get, you get quite a few stories. Um, and a lot of people are, it's a lot of them, it's not through any of their own doing. Those are the ones that really hit home the most for me, I guess. Um, specific ones, I guess, could be a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you know, some of my friends, they, they're friends. Um, but the ones, I guess, could be about domestic violence or something like that, where they literally have had no, no fault at all. Like it's never their fault, but they've had absolutely nothing to do with it and they've just had to flee, you know, with their kids or something like that and living out of a car, those, those are stories that really, yeah, really run at home for me. Um, and I mean, you do hear, if you do ask the right questions, you get plenty of stories about every different type of situation. Um, but yeah, just for me personally, that's, those are the stories that I think about. most of the time so yeah. That's cool. And what sort of, how do you sort of feel each time you sort of leave a shift, like is there something in which you feel like growth or knowledge or connection like is there a certain feeling or emotion that stands out most when you leave? Yeah, I guess the biggest feeling for me when it's time to leave is I don't want to leave. But yeah, with work and everything I do have to. So yeah, but coming away from it I don't think there's ever been a time where I'm not smiling as I'm walking back to my car on my motorbike. It's always made me feel happy above all else. Sometimes a little bit concerned, you know, if someone's told you some things that you can see they're really struggling with then a bit concerned but every time I come out of it, yeah, basically happy knowing that you've, you know, whether they've said it or not, you can tell they're just having a good day afterwards. They're happy to be heard, happy to get fed and happy to, you know, have their clothes washed and yeah, every time I come out of it it's just definitely growth, absolutely. Just understanding how other people live because I've always been very fortunate. Parents who are well off and together and, you know, never have had any issues that are known to me at least. So yeah, growth I guess would be growth and happy. Those are the two biggest ones I'd say. Cool. And last question, if someone's thinking about volunteering at Iron Sky, like sort of on the fence what would you say to them that would maybe get them out of their lives? Swing by. Come around, have a chat to anyone here and even if you don't mention that you want to start volunteering you could just be, do it a bit secretly, come in and just act like anyone else. See how they treat you, see how it goes, see how it makes you feel and that's how you can make other people feel basically. So yeah, come down, have a chat to us and if you want to let us know that you're thinking about volunteering we'll run you through everything, what's involved and yeah, there's no, there's no age limit, well there is, but anything above 18, yeah. We get a lot of retired people here working but by all means I'm 19 and yeah, love it. There's nothing stopping the young kids from doing it either. Amazing. Yeah. Well done, that's it. Sweet as. Happy days. Cheers to that mate. So cool mate.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Tracy & Jared\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThese broadcast comes, oh, an acronym for a military. Alright. Mics are good. You're good? Yep. Let's go. Okay. And first what we'll do is say your full name and spell it for me. It'll be awesome. Full as in na, first and last or just, okay. Okay. Tracy McIntyre. T-R-A-C-Y-M-C-I-N-T-Y-R-E. Amazing.\n\nAnd just your role, David. Just a general volunteer. Awesome. Yeah. Jared Keating. So G-E-R-A-R-D-K-A-T-I-N-G, like the former Prime Minister. And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Celeste Gibbs\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nFun. Fun. And I'm gonna cut my hands. Wows, they've got hats. What? Yeah, they're doing the roofs and stuff around here. Okay. And there's a history of asbestos? I think so, yeah. That's scary seeing those things. I know there's something really like visceral around, so people walking on those things, hat smartt suits, you're like, oh, do I need one?\n\nOkay. And cool. So first thing. We do. Is I'm going to get your name. I'm gonna make sure we're still rolling. And this is focused, it's really hard to focus this one, a little tiny screen, and you're like, is that focused or is it not? Cool. So just let me know your name and spell it for me.\n\nIt'll be awesome. Celeste, C-E-L-E-S-T-E Gibbs, GI double BS. Cool. And email or phone? That's either or honestly. Yeah. Cool. CG dot Gibbs. [00:01:00] GI double BS Yep. zero1@gmail.com.\n\nAmazing. I got it.\n\nAll right. Bit old.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself. First and foremost, who are you? I am a volunteer at Orange Sky. I'm a public servant. I work at a radio station on weekends, and I'm doing my masters in international relations. That's a lot of things in a very short amount of time. That's like the most succinct.\n\nProfiles someone, are you also very as part of your work, do you do things to increase efficiency? No, actually I work in diplomacy and treaty implementation. Wow. We'll have to talk later. [00:02:00] Sounds amazing. Cool. And tell me a little bit more about, I think if you tell me a little bit about, a little bit more about your work.\n\nYeah. Because that might help lead into the next bit of conversation. Yeah. Okay. So I work for the department of industry Science and Resources. Currently that's what it's called. It might be called something different. And this is all done. And I work on the diplomatic relationship between Australia and Timor Lessee.\n\nGreat. I was just talking to someone about these two directions. Alright. So tell me how you first heard about or Skype. So I was doing my undergrad at the time and Covid had just hit, I was studying from home, didn't have a job feeling very classically isolated and I was just walking past the TV and somebody had it on whatever channel and it was an ad showing the different volunteering opportunities you could do to help people.\n\nAnd I figured I don't have any money, but I have a lot of time on my hands. And I'd heard about Orange [00:03:00] Sky previously because of when Nick and Luke won the young Australian of Year award. Yep. So I just signed up, rocked up and have been here nearly five years later. Wow. Yeah. That's awesome. Tell me a little bit more about this idea of what keeps you coming back to Einstein.\n\nFor me, a big part of it is the community aspect. It's. I found myself really passionate about Orange sky for a lot of different reasons. One of the main things that keeps me coming back is our friends and the people I volunteer with it. It is a very big community here. There is a very big community.\n\nYou have individual communities of different ships where we have, friends who come back every week and you get to know them in their lives and their stories and they touch you in a very personal way. And I've also made some lifelong friendships with other volunteers, who I see outside of volunteering.\n\nWe go get lunch. Stuff like that. It's. [00:04:00] It just become a really essential part of my life. I don't, I can't imagine how it would be without it. So Cool. Yeah. What's the impact do you think, on a volunteer in general in, in turning up the orange sky and is there something more than just the way in which you engage or the friends that come, like what's, is there a broader impact you think on volunteers that come to.\n\nBroader impact. That's the main thing you are looking into, isn't it? Yeah, I,\n\nI would say yes. It's a bit like it's a domino effect. It, the butterfly theory, a butterfly flats, it wings in Africa and then suddenly a mountain falls in China or whatever you, it's. It's not that dramatic, but there's definitely, I've seen a very I've seen an impact in how we behave and how that influences our friends and then how our friends treat one another.\n\nWe've had we have two friends at another shift I've go to who have met [00:05:00] and they take care of one another now, right? They do little things to help each other out. One of them buys the other dog food, that sort of thing. I think it also. For a lot of our friends, I've noticed we become a core part of their social institution, their social circle, and a core part of their routine, and that has a really.\n\nNoticeable impact in who they are as people and how now they go and navigate the world. Something that I always find really exciting. Oh, I whacked the microphone. Sorry. I'll do that again. Something that I always find really exciting is so we work this shift here, blue Door is an at-risk housing facility.\n\nSo something I find quite heartening is when our friends are able to. Find permanent accommodation and every single one of them who has got an accommodation, they cite Orange Sky, is one of the reasons they're able to do that because it's given them a sense of place and purpose and has helped them be people again.\n\nCool. Yeah. What is the things [00:06:00] that are there certain elements that you like more about knowing Sky Shift or less? What's the thing that keeps. Coming keeps you coming back and other elements of that are hard and but still keeps you coming back as well.\n\nThe hardest thing, I think\n\nsome of the people we meet, it can be quite confronting because they've had such tough lives and we're ordinary people. We're not. I'm not a mental health specialist, right? So finding an equilibrium and a balance and help in being able to support them for the two and a half hours that we're here, I find can be challenging at times.\n\nThere's a heaps of resources. Orange Sky provides to help, which, and also the fact that we have three people here. We can like work together as a team and support one another. It's challenging if we have to turn people away. Or when there's not enough [00:07:00] time to do all the loads. This shift especially can get quite busy. We've done 13 loads once. We were very dedicated that day. Just because, it's very tough for people to then have to make alternate arrangements at times.\n\nYeah. I think the main thing I love is our friends and the people I volunteer with it. It's a really lovely atmosphere. I think it's a very community heavy atmosphere and yeah, they keep me coming back. I wanna see who, I wanna see how people are doing. That's cool. Yeah. Cool. What's this idea of like your work for the radio station, which is cool, and maybe there's interactions with the public who interact with the radio and what that communication's they, what do you think the power of.\n\nSharing more diverse stories is rather than like the media's very good at showing things that create buzz or hype or fucking whatever. How important is it to try and tell more diverse stories? Oh, diverse. Diverse stories are crucial, right? I think especially because [00:08:00] Australia is such a multicultural country and the fact that so many people have such different experiences in their lives, I think.\n\nThe ability to see yourself reflected in something more mainstream is incredibly powerful because it asserts your sense of self. It yeah. So di diverse stories, I think are crucial in doing that and also in teaching others about other things in the world, right? It's to be. Given the opportunity to learn about somebody different than you, I think is such privilege because it opens your eyes in a very unique way that wouldn't happen otherwise.\n\nAnd I think is very humbling and very heartening. That's cool. And we call this keys to the city. Which means is rambling we didn't talk about that you think is important. Or is there things that like even. Relate to orange sky or friends or something that you've always wanted to say something about?\n\nSomething about orange sky in general. [00:09:00] That's like always been, you've always wanted to put somewhere. Do you I what I, something I really love about orange sky is, so the experience of homelessness is by its nature, very isolating, right? To wind up in a position where you have so little and when you have so little.\n\nSelf-determination and agency that you wind up on the street is inherently an isolating experience and. And we all do it right when you're walking on the street and you see someone doing it tough and you don't wanna look because it's too confronting. So you just keep your head straight and you just zoom, walk past and we all do it.\n\nWhat I find really valuable about Orange Sky is that it gives that dignity and agency back to people who are so often denied that, and it gives back that social experience to people who are so frequently denied that in an environment where there's no judgment, there's no. Issue. Everybody treats people equally and it's just, it's such [00:10:00] a wonderful environment that I'm so proud of being able to contribute to.\n\nAnd that's cool. Yeah. There we go. Amazing. All right. Now we just need a photo. You just stay there? Yeah. Trying a new thing here. Hopefully I can make this work.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "from Mackay but you know North Queensland they're talking about down south it's South of Rockhampton yeah and I'm talking about Sydney yeah yeah yeah my old man the day he finished his apprenticeship he got on his 125cc motorbike in 1955 and rode out of Mackay never to return oh really yeah Mackay to Rocky was all dirt still at that stage yeah there was no bitumen North of Rockhampton I was in Mackay last few weeks ago I don't mind it all right got a lot bigger yeah all right that'll do right it's your name and spell it that's cool too yeah when you look at me it's all cool okay yeah I'm Greg Graham g-r-e-g-g-r-a-h-a-m cool and tell us a little bit about yourself I guess what's a couple of couple of key key points that what people know about you yeah I've been retired now for three years and working with Orange Sky for about two and a half for those three years um predominantly here but I cover the odd shift shortage if we've got a sort of a group chat that if people are short and they jump on and we go and help out so I live locally not far from here and um yeah it's been a good thing for me in retirement it's been a good opportunity to get out and about and do something different to what I did for 40 odd years at work what'd you do for work I worked in the heavy earth moving and mining equipment sector so worked for the caterpillar dealer here in Newcastle for the last eight years before I finished up 21. I don't know if I have a breezy caterpillar deal or not I've got a couple of thousand there's probably a few of them in there yeah I might know him Marshall's his name I can't remember his name um Cole what's um what's what's come to Orange Sky like for you how does it feel that feels pretty good yeah we've got a regular group of people that we help with their laundry here and together with the the lunch etc that Catholic Care put on so it's yeah it's kind of a knit little group and then we have a few people who you know probably aren't that regular but the regular people are all super friendly and I'm happy to be part of the whole Orange Sky experience and like it's um laundry and stuff yeah so we wash and dry people's clothing for them that they either don't have access to it or there's something else that prevents them from from doing their own laundry whether it's their health or um the fact they don't have access to the facilities etc it can be any number of things so we don't pry too deeply into why they they use it we're just happy to give them a hand and take it from there what's the feeling of like the connection I guess and conversation and stuff is it pretty casual yeah generally it's pretty casual you know some people a bit more upset one week to the next but um yeah generally pretty casual and I think the fact that we've got so many regulars and that we've got a pretty small team here there's only six or seven people in the group and there's only six or seven of us work this shift and so a lot of us are here most weeks and we've got to know all these people you know really well what's um has it changed you in any way do you think in terms of perception or life or anything after volunteering oh look I think I won't say I lived my whole life under a rock but I think you don't when you're immersed in full-time work and you're not doing any volunteering of any kind it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble it's pretty easy to just live in your own little bubble and not have a very broad understanding of you know what life's like for other people that aren't that far from where you live and what what's your perception of this area I guess in Newcastle and is there is there different areas in Newcastle that are doing a bit more tough than others um yeah look I think this area generally does it tough it just whether the economy is good or not these people are you know they're up against it and um you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and you know you just pick it up in the conversations with them and it's it's um you know it's a life's life's uh a bit challenging for a lot of these people a lot of the time there's no there's no easy days here and um so yeah that's been one of the good things it just helps you be a bit more grounded and I think the other thing is you realize that you know it's pretty easy when you're you know embroiled in your own little bubble to be more judgmental than you should be and yeah a bit more considerate of the nature of what people are up against um I really started just because I I wanted to do something that would help other people with their you know the time I had on my hands once I retired and um I'd seen a bit of media about Orange Sky and I thought it was a good idea and I just put my hand up to to volunteer for it so what's the conversation with friends and family changed in terms of what you do here and do they ask about this and homelessness yeah they do I think um yeah they most people here in Newcastle don't really understand what goes on Hamilton South or public housing areas and um so it's been good to be able to say look you know they're just people making their way as best they can and um you know it's not not whatever your preconceived notion of what goes on um you know it's typically um not not accurate what's um it's like a different question I I never am good at answering this but what's the type of things you think look like the person can do that's kind of helpful for people that are experiencing homelessness like outside of giving money or whatever are there actions that they can take is there a perception that they can change like what's your take on what people can do well I think if they you know if their rest of their life sort of allows it get involved in some face-to-face stuff because you know you can read about lots of things but you really need to get that personal experience and interaction with people to get a deeper and better understanding of of what's going on that's a good answer it's a little better answers I've got for that uh cool is there anything else like you wanted to say in relation to orange sky like um my very good mate Nicholas Marchese is listening so feedback critical yeah no we're I think we're very well supported by the broader Orange Sky organization and the people you know when we've had technical issues or anything like that um it's never been too much trouble for anyone we've had to get on the other end of the phone so you know it's the it's a robust Front Line Organization and it's got a robust back room that's helping those people that are delivering the services to their to our friends gotta wave out a brand team too yeah last four years yeah no it's a strong brand it's a lot of people you don't have to explain too much you know about what Orange Guy does once you tell them they go oh yeah that's the the laundry bands or you know okay that's that's it that's all it's an out, not an option one by one one by one by one is a good thing. whatever so I think yeah whoever's running the brand piece is doing a good job. Cool, maybe I can say that back to Nicholas and I can go get a bonus for my previous time building the brand. Yeah, cool that's it. Hit him up. Pay the money Nicholas.\n",

      "Transcript": "  \"text\": \" Action. Kel? Happy about that? Look at Nico there, Richard. Oh, okay. See? So you don't look in the camera, you look off camera. That's the better side. Well, now you say it like that. Funny. Initially, I actually went, oh, gosh, that's an attachment to the cannon. Then I went, oh, no, how the hell is that? Two times the cannon. I don't know how to say it. Two times the action. Mmm. Maybe let's start with the easy stuff, Rich. Where are we right now? Where are we right now? Yeah. So we're at the top of Mount Bentley. More specifically, this is where we we are endeavoring to have a plant propagation so i suppose and this is the uh second field i call it yeah what country are we yeah so mount bentley so is uh um yeah this is myumburra Country. Yeah, so a little ways over to my shoulder to my right is a little waterhole there that's the Gabba Dreaming. So we're not far from one of the story places, one of the key story places for our mob, the Carpetake Dreaming. What's your connection to culture? What's your cultural connections to? Yeah, this place. Yeah, so this is my grandmother's country. And she's a mum of a woman We married a Nahuatl man. So Nahuatl country is 30k, you know, in that area where we called Ingham and down to Rolling Stone, that's the Great Divide. That's Nahuatl country. But grandfather would say to me, you know, Richie, you're always gonna look after your grandmother's country. So a very long road to coming back and to this place and just the honor of carrying out my cultural obligation to that story, looking after grandmother's country. What does country mean to you? Um, oh gosh, here we go. Yeah, connection. Um, yeah, provides connection, belonging. Yeah, it's a space that keeps me grounded. But also grounded because our story, our mambla story is written in this country here. So different places, different story places. It grounds me and it keeps me centered. And in a sense, gives me a purpose and joy. Yeah, yeah. We're going to dive into a few different, um, uh, sort of cultural stories that are profound in your wisdom and sharing. But before we do that, like what's, what's story mean to you and what's the significance of story in your life? Hmm. Yeah. Um, yeah. So I think it's, it's come out of or in response to, um, navigating, um, what I call the doing culture in Australia which is what do you do when you grow up I'm going to be something and this is what I'll do and so yeah so that sense of yeah it's a long way of saying, you know, that I went and got an education, I got a trade, I got a degree and there were things that I did. But that didn't translate into my belonging or my sense of who I am. Yeah. So what was the question? Who are you then? Yeah. So, so in a sense, um, country helps me be, and helps me be me, um, and helps me understand who I am. And it's out of that that from that base of where I land and say okay that I can work out what my doing is going to be you know if that makes any sense talk me through this idea of our story our story so yeah our story story comes out of the narrative of, there was a time when I had two stories. I had a doing story and a being story. The doing story is what I did to earn a cut of living, to be able to provide for family, to, and do those things that every Australian, in terms of the Australian narrative, the quarter acre block, yeah, I could do that and did it a couple of times and then went hmm. So that was one story. and then went hmm so that was one story um um the other story of who i am and uh which you i didn't fully understand or know that when granddad said you're going to look after your grandmother's country I did not know the fullness of what that meant, if that makes any sense. And so that's been a journey. It's been a journey to sit with elders, to find the place of their belonging, to find those stories and in a sense I couldn't work out what I needed to do in that space until I could be in that space. And so that meant that I had to be on country and have time with my old people and time around the fire and time around understanding stories um and time to be quiet um to learn um yeah how do we as a well i guess um talk me through this um the story you shared very generously around like tell me your, I'll tell you my story, and let's create our story. Talk me through that and where does that come from? Yeah, so I couldn't, you can't do something or give advice to someone about those sorts of things unless you walk the walk, if that makes any sense. Those sorts of things unless you walk the walk that makes any sense So in a sense I had to join those two stories together and then work out What my story was going to be? Interesting so So in really I Navigate those two worlds Intuitively inside almost all day every day. So I've got this dominant culture side and I've got this, yeah. But then, and this cultural side. And one informs each other. What the amazing thing is, though, is that I can take that model and translate and almost use it as a vehicle to engage not only first people to engage because I say to my cousin brothers or who I'm talking to or my colleagues or my the workers under me, we've got to navigate these two wells but for you to understand these two wells you've got to navigate these two worlds. But for you to understand these two worlds, you've got to know your own world. So it is about knowing your story first. That's the first thing. The second thing then is that when we engage in that space with the two worlds and with the other world, with the other understanding, with the other world, with the other understanding. There are people who are wanting to come into this space and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folk, well, tell me your story and I'll tell you my story and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become an our story. The principle doesn't change, it's the practice if that makes any sense and so that's the interesting space. It's a very, I think, it's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings, rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use, if that makes any sense. Story is a good vehicle to be able to work on, because everyone understands that story, yeah, that concept of story. Talk me through the story of the sphere, and the two sides of the the spear and what that means to you? Yeah. So that story was gifted to me by a brother from Bundjalung country, Cole Slatt, the story of two brothers and how those brothers had a certain cultural obligation to work on and in order for them to be able to execute on that they had to be in relationship with one another. They not only had to be in relationship with one another and understand how to, I guess, make that spear, how to find that spear, how to straighten that spear, but they also knew and understand that they also needed others to be able to get into that space and produce that spear. And so that concept of the knowledge holder and the one that yearns or thirsts that knowledge was a respectful transaction. Yeah, and so it was out of that that I was able to then look at my relationship with my brother, my grandfather's relationship with his brother and the sense that we all had gifts, we all had strengths, we all had, I wouldn't say weaknesses, but things that we were reliant on the other to bring into the space. yeah we're dependent on one another so that was really interesting to to to then have that story gifted to myself and then able to then say oh actually we know that story that story is actually embedded in the space. So we also learned that in that space, you know, it's almost like pulling a string. Once you start that thread about that story, you go, oh yeah, well, yeah, and by the way, no one holds that old story. And it just keeps going on and you go, oh, okay. So, yeah, part of the spear is that we learn now, to put it in today's context, how you talk about the one brother who's, or the one story that comes from First Peoples, and we talk about L-I-Y-R-E. I talked to my alpha and I said, we've got to navigate this new story that's come into the asbestos because the environment's changed. So we call it the L-I-W story. And so when we make this spear, this one that enables us to cut a path into this landscape, we actually need two sides of the story, the L-O-R-E and the L-A-W. And yeah, and so in that sense, we're sensitive to brothers and sisters who come to this place, who've got a heart to stand in respectful conversation with us, who say, tell me your story. And this is our story. And we go, oh. And then we say, how can my story and your story become in our story the other part of that two registered spear despair is that there is this the spear has two edges but there's there's a body in that spearhead um and so part of the the body of that spirit is the conversations, the respectful conversations that we have, whether it's through individuals, whether it's through councils, whether it's through CEOs and those are the conversations that happen. The mechanism that we have within that spirit is held in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we say, well, what's in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we we say well what's in the shaft well the shaft is all of our policies and procedures and how we and and our hr documents and how we i guess um give backbone to that spirit and if you don't have those elements And if you don't have those elements, what you've got is two edges and you haven't got any drive sort of thing, you know. Yeah, and then I think even if you talk about the length of that spear and how it powers, part of what drives that spear to be able to have an impact in community is, you know, the vision that an organisation or a person that has. It might be in, you know, the strategic plan, whatever that is, but it's trying to make sense of, for my people, how can we use a cultural artifact to understand what we're going to do? And yeah, and when we say, oh, yeah, this is going to drive and power up our spirit, then we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. So it's a helpful way to understand that construct because then what happens is that as we then build organisations, we've got a young organisation, Mumba Operations, we then can figure out, because we use spears to hunt fish, and we go, oh, well, now we're oh, well, now we're hunting for particular fish. So we want the Goggin who understands how to do finance, the Goggin who understands business, and the one who helps us shape policies and procedures and whatever. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. Talk me through the Barnum and what have you. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. So talk me through the Bhanam and the Gogan. So that's probably the key story that holds how we operate, if that makes any sense. So, yeah, that you have a knowledge holder and then you also have the one that you... So, yeah, you can't really talk it through except to say, this is how it works. And then once someone grabs that understanding then did you work it out in your practice. That story is dependent though in its practice for for entities to hold each other's story in balance or gently, if that makes any sense, and respectful conversations. It's not to say, I am the one who knows and you need to jump through. It's about know, it's about, about hey i've got something that i'm going to offer you and you can choose to take that story or you can choose not to take that story but then that's okay um and i know that um when we when we have those conversations, that space, some, because that was a conversation that my old people had, we had the ability to actually say, I'm not ready to carry that story yet. So it's really interesting. So yeah. Where does the Bāna and Gobind come from? It's an apocultural practice. Yeah, yeah. The fact that we can name it has been a gift. We've actually practiced it. But we actually, then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. So it's not as if you find gold. You actually were doing things intuitively. I remember saying to someone, well, there's a show. Who do you think I am? Yeah. Yeah. And people would follow their DNA and then they'd discover, oh gosh, this is why I'm wired the way I do or why I might like woodwork or why I might love fishing. It's because I've actually had things running through my veins that I didn't understand, if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. understand if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. Is there a moment where it comes to mind where you had that Barnum and Goggin present in your life, like when you were seeking knowledge and it came, or you were gifting knowledge? Oh, again, it's out of practice. My grandfather, he was the governor who taught me here. 80% of what I know in terms of how to navigate country and from the age of, oh, eight or nine, you know. Yeah. Yeah, but I was sent to my grandfather by my father, who taught me some things to a certain point. So you learn in stages, so my grandfather took the lead role to give me the old knowledge, And then he then handed me to my uncles who honed that knowledge into a sharper, more focused thing of where to go for certain fish. So it took all of those knowledge holders to get me to shape who I was, who I am. However, and this is the however that I find, is that the Barnum Goggin story was really important because it was an old story that crystallised that practice. You know, I just thought this is why he just did it, if that makes any sense. There was enough. Yeah, but then what we learned now is that that was their cultural practice. And it's an old story that runs right across this landscape. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Do you want to talk about the pebble? Do I? Yeah. Yeah. We should do this. You know, I was actually thinking about this and I thought, oh, okay. These sort of conversations usually are hard to do in a sit-down space because you usually do it when you're on the mire. Yeah. So, yeah. So the Pebble story is about you know minding our footprint um so when we talk about minding our footprint we as human beings um we suffer from the fact that that we have things that tell us that our footprint has been great so things like global warming and how the environment's um trading and uh some of times it's doing well and sometimes it's not doing too well the fact that we have um you know animal species becoming extinct and we think about here in Australia where we introduce things like the cane toad and we go, oh. And if that's an indication of a pebble, you go, oh, that was a big pebble. So the story behind the pebble is actually how we enter someone else's country and grandfather would say, you know, yeah, we can have these things. Well, he wouldn't say because he didn't know about the things that we do in terms of welcoming the countries and all those sorts of things that we do, which is absolutely fantastic, don't get me wrong. But he had a very simple story because he actually said, boy, every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. Every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. And I did not know what they meant by that concept of country even back then. But what he says is the principle, whenever you go across and you get into a new space, first thing you do is find a little bit of water and you find yourself a pebble. You take that pebble and you might put your sweat on that pebble under your arm, but you toss that pebble into the water. And that was it. That was just the practice. And you went, oh, okay. And for years, I was just going, I just passed this paper. I didn't ask why. This was just what you did. It wasn't until a little bit later that you come across other elders and other elders would have From different story places whatever Welcome to country and in that welcome to country they would put this get a pebble and they wipe their sweat on And they would toss it in the water and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone but anyway and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone, but anyway. And I'd go, oh. What happens is in the quiet spaces when you're sitting on country, country then speaks to you about those stories and you reflect on it and you go, oh. And I remember thinking to myself one day, I went, why didn't you get a boulder? Why didn't you get a rock? Because when we were young, we'd throw a big-ass rock in the water, you know what I'm saying? Why was it a pebble? And as you stop and you reflect about that, I remember finding stones, and we would get the most smallest, flattest stone and as kids we'd show it. We'd do this practice but we'd show it to the heavens. And then we'd watch it go and it would just make the splash and go. And we'd go, that's a good start. And as you get older and wiser, you think about that and you go, oh, that's why he wanted a pebble. Because we've got to manage our footprint. And so, don't come to someone else's country as a rock or a boulder, but as a pebble, so that your footprint is small. But when you leave, that person says, oh, that one came, your presence is great, and there's a heart. Yeah, he came and didn't make a ripple. So he's welcome anytime. What's your dream for this site same same we look at this the boulder of this pine trees which is not our car shouldn't be in our country um why they're here well they're here because someone thought it was a bright idea to take all the old growth out of here and use that old growth timber for the mission and then replace it with the pine trees. So, yeah, we've come... We're planning to minimise that boulder and the impact of that rock and restore this country. And so down over here where you see all of these, the seedlings from the rainfalls, that's the last 10 years of growth in that creek lying down here. And so those pine trees that are... Oh, palm trees that are there, they're average between five to eight years old, and they're strong. So the country is restoring itself and regenerating itself and um and so we're not going to do a new thing we're going to figure out how we can harvest some of these seedlings and then restore this space um yeah it might not like look like all of that but It might not look like all of that, but some of it. What's your hope of this site too, is in 10 years time? In 10 years time, in 10 years time, this particular area, we hope that in the plant propagation space, that the younger leaders who come here, who, they can imagine something here. So the old folk have had a strategic plan back in 2010. My role is to create the foundations for that to operate. And now we're in that space of training education and we're having our young barn arm leaders learn from the dominant culture the that how to navigate the space but also how to what does it mean to work in the plant propagation area. And then how to think business-wise and what could that imagine it to be. So the goal will be that in this space, some of our young people from Palm will be inspired to imagine what this place might look like. And so, yeah, in 10 years' time, I don't know what will happen in 10 years time i don't know what happened 10 years time but i'll hopefully to court and release some of those banners to be a goggins of this place and they can work out what that might look like why is the um the willy wagtail important to you yeah um yeah everyone's got a story of redemption. The Wagtail is my story of redemption. I don't want to go into that part of it, except to say that the Wagtail in our culture is good news and when we hear we get bright chirping busy little busybody yeah so the wagtail for me is has been that story of being chirpy and bringing some some good news to the space. Yeah, so he's been my totem since I was a young fella. And yeah, I do, it's really interesting cause he's got the black and white colours and I resonate with him because I find myself in the space where I'm navigating these two worlds and hopefully as I do that I'm being a noisy wagtail but bringing good news into that two world conversation. good news into that two-world conversation. We were talking about noise last night, in particular music, but what are the noises that you're prioritising listening to right now? What are the sounds that are important for you to be listening to? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. The more I am in this rainforest area, the more I see the complexity of the different species and the different power regions and what each species of tree bring to give shelter to not only a bird life but also the insects and and then you know yeah just that diversity And we call them plants, don't we? It's collective, we call them plants. And I think about that often and I go, oh wow, it's a magic place, but these plants place but these plants do something where they're intuitively cooperating and engaging with one another and you know and when the breeze comes there's a little bit of give and go, you know, the sway and yeah it's just really interesting. So the space I'm occupying in terms of this Bhanam-Garga and relationship space isn't so much the knowledge holder or the one that earns, but the good oil that runs between the two entities. Yeah. And I have a sense that if we're all plants, we're all human beings, or we're all brothers and sisters, if we're all friends or whatever collective word that we could use that doesn't bring an us and them, I think we could be a pretty good rainforest at some point. And that's probably by some happy point. How can we collectively collectively be shelter to those birds of the air that are just going, I need somewhere to roost tonight. How can we potentially at some point die to oneself and regenerate into something new. And I'm not talking physically die, I don't want to die, but my ideas or my ego, whatever it is, so that I can let go and let something else flourish. I think, yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. Yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. And what's the... What's the Rich Cassidy story that you hope people take from being in your presence? Yeah, I've often said, and this is the small pebble story, because I've often thought about this a lot, about the small pebble, because I want to be the smallest pebble I can be, the sharpest stone, the one that has the least impact. But I often reflect about when you go back to the place where that pebble went into and you look for that pebble it's gone it's very hard to find and so i'm probably thinking that yeah my footprint would be that no one knew that i was here in the first place and that'd be pretty cool and so then what do you think your purpose is? What gets you out of it? What gets me out of it? I think it's, yeah, that when I come to a place, to come to country and I go, oh, I remember that story. I remember some friends who, you know, on the Facebook thing, they would send a shout out and they would very recently say, oh Rich, so right, Cal. Just thinking of you. And I go, ah yeah, that's good. See that's, yeah, that's the impact that you want. That's it. Any other questions? Oh my God. I don't know if that's really useful or not. I'm trying to think about this artefact of, like, you as being a knowledge holder to share with, like, organisations. Sort of picturing the artefact of, like, a bit about you, a few of these stories. Is there any other sort of like, maybe you're very humble. Yeah, so this is the one that I think will be useful in the mainstream setting. So you talked about the Barnarm Cogran thing. One of the biggest stories that we have in the Australian landscape is the story of mateship. I've often thought about this and I think about that story of Gallipoli in some ungodly place. Young men were sent to war and found themselves in difficult circumstances. But that narrative, that story is right across this landscape. You go to any town and you'll find an NJAC square or a monument that depicts that story. And we call that story now very, we don't call it Gallipoli, we call it might. You know, might, mightship. You know, you look at the football, they talk about mateship, yeah, cricket, and the principles of sacrifices and no one being left behind. We just all gravitate to it and go, oh, we understand it. So it's not as if I'm talking about something that's, when I talk about stories, that's something that's grandiose or colorful. It's the DNA of the human species. And I think if that's a starting point for you to go, oh, okay, I understand where the starting point, because I understand that story. the starting point because I understand that story. Then if we learn another story about, well, that's a story back in 1914, 18. I can't remember when it was. Sorry. But there's this other story that we've got and it's bloody old. I don't know how old it was, but it's a cool story too, you know what I'm saying? I know it's not quite mateship but it's, yeah. So maybe if we go, how can we get this story of mateship and learn that and have this older story that we've got and that's our story, my story. I don't know, I think there's something in that way then in the two brothers story no one's going to be left behind. Is that okay? And what do you think is the most common thing people come to you for knowledge is? Oh look I think everyone gets to a point I think if they're honest with themselves where they've gone down a rabbit hole they've went down a one-way street they've had to do a u-turn they've not only had to do a three-point turn it's been 16-point turn you know and when they've got out they went oh wow okay i got out of that you know yeah yeah um i can't remember what the question was what people come to you for advice for yeah so the part of them getting in the car and turning it around or what are you doing yeah yeah so i think one of the things that i have found invariably is the one principle that our people hold on to that even though we've whether he's whether he's where you've got the knowledge holding the one at the ends they all they all are invariably the same the answer is in country and you just got to look around and and find that yeah and so the most of the times the answers are thin. And more often than not, we just get tangled in our own space and we bring all of these obstacles and we go, oh, damn. So part of, I think, the role is, for me in this space, is as a navigator, is, yeah, is being a guide. I wouldn't say guide to, it's about navigating a space. And it's about having respectful conversations and it's, it's about, it is about understanding the story of the other in a way that you might not have that answer, but you go, ah, I can see you, see me see you. And it's about trying to see one in someone, but not, and to hold that other gently. And conversely, if that's switched the other way around, then I think you've got a powerful space for conversation. Yeah. Dad? Richard. Thanks, Fran. What a gift okay you got a vision you got a bit\",\n\n\n",

Sometimes it just depends on who it is. Sometimes they can be like really stubborn, like today, but the washing machine's kind of out of action, so yeah. Cool, and what do you think about the Iron Sky service? Tell us a little bit about your experience with Iron Sky. They've always been nice, always been good, yeah. That's cool, and what do you like the most? Is it the conversation, the hanging out, the like, what's your most favorite part? Yeah, you can hang out, you can have a chat. Also here at the neighborhood center, same thing. They have a little lunch on, so come up here, put your washing on, go get some lunch, and by the time lunch is finished, clothes are done. So yeah, and I reckon they need to do so much more for the community. They're a really nice community center. They do get donations, they do get business grants, but it's only just helping out our community, so yeah. So true. I do what I can to donate. I'm only on a pension, so it's very little what I can donate, but still, it's something, and something's better than nothing, so. And what do you think the community should be able to do? How can they help more, I guess, to be able to support this stuff? Well, there has been a bit of a debate about it. There is a building here that's out of commission. I thought that they would have it for the homeless. I don't know if they did or not. So, just working with the homeless and trying to make sure that there's something for them. Try and make sure that there's a safe place to stay. I know. I know other places that have done it and it's only like for a day. You can only stay there for 24 hours But it's a step to recovery. It's a step to link to home Some people don't even know what link to home is because it's their first time homeless Yeah, just get like some kind of temporary service more available. Yeah So what's um, what's one thing you think that the community can do better when it comes to a general understanding of? People doing it tough in the region like is there things that people can do that's like All this money that's supposed to go into the mental health system Where is it? I mean attacks within three days Problems both of them include weapons I have had my mental health problems, but I've never had anything like that. I've never done anything like that And I just reckon we need more Just like more security measurements I mean, I've never done anything like that before Cool. That's awesome. Let's go\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Sarah Jessica Meyers\n\n[00:00:00] I'm just gonna clap my hands because it helps me sync the cameras up. Alright, I think we're rocking. Just look at me. Yep. First of all, just your full name and spell it. Spell it? Yeah. Just say your full name and spell it. My name's Sarah Jessica Meyers. S-A-R-A-H-I-R-E-L-N. A and d No, I'm terrible at spelling.\n\nNo, that's okay. I wasn't expecting that. Sorry. Oh, that was a head fuck. I've gotta but my full name is Sarah Jessica Meyer. So just tell me a little bit about yourself at the beginning. I originally grew up in wa. I moved to Tasmania in 2006 with my parents through, I guess a relationship breakdown with my parents.\n\nI ended up in the welfare system. I, by the time I think [00:01:00] I was 14, I was a offending and hanging out with some not good so good people, which resulted with me getting incarcerated quite a number of times. By the time I was 16, I'd broken out of that cycle of bad behavior and I guess addiction.\n\nI suffered with addiction issues when I was younger and it's led into homelessness as an adult. So it's my story. When I was 19, I got into my first relationship and. We had a good relationship for a number of years before it turned sour. But through that period I actually went and did my youth work, cert four and ended up working for council for a little while.\n\nSo there's many bad things that I have experienced. I've always tried to do the right thing and educate myself in ways that I can better look after myself and the community. And yeah, that's what. Just tell me at any point, or you don't wanna answer something, [00:02:00] but what are some of those lessons you think that stand out the most from believe in yourself?\n\nI think that's the biggest thing that I've taken out of this, is that everyone has different problems. We all come from different walks of life, and sometimes you've just gotta be there for yourself instead of looking for outside validation. You should recognize that you are the most important person in your life and that only you can help you, I think a lot of people seek outside validation to help themselves when really it's about going inwards, not outwards.\n\nAnd I think that's probably the best thing that I've learned is to work on yourself. And it honestly never stops. You'll always be learning. But it's that courage to try and it's that courage to wanna do better. I think the one thing that stands out straight away from the first part of your story is, bravery and you being able to tell that story, I think that's important.\n\nBut [00:03:00] then there's also experience in which you pass on. What are some of the ways in which you are working to pass on your experience to support other people that might like you guys? I think just being there for people. I think experience wise I know what it was like as a young person, not to have someone there, and so I think just showing up and being present, being there for people when they need it, everyone has different problems my ability to help my only just be advice and sending 'em in the right direction with someone who has that.\n\nInformation so that they can make an informed decision about what they're doing and not make a decision based from fear and being alone. Because I think a lot of the time that is what happens. People internalize their struggles and they make emotional decisions rather than rational ones.\n\nI think a lot of the curriculum, I think if we taught emotional intelligence and things like that in the schools, it would help a lot, for people to be able to navigate their own. Problems. Yeah. I think [00:04:00] most of the population has a very surface level of these words. Homelessness or struggle or disadvantage.\n\nWhat is it, what does that mean to you? Are those types of are they stigma? Are they worth connect with? How's that? Me and my friends argue about this all the time because I think homelessness is a choice. You can choose to wanna be a better person or you can choose to buy into the addictions and these things that were fed by society.\n\nBut it is a choice. And like I said emotional intelligence and having the ability to make an informed decision got will take you a lot further. And so I think education at the very basic. Level is a fundamental thing that needs to change in our country because without education you can't make an informed decision.\n\nSo I think that is really where we need to start the reform process really of education and the curriculum and what we're teaching children and young people, because [00:05:00] otherwise we'll stay, we stay stuck. What is special or interesting about the stuff that Orange Sky is doing as a service? I think what Orange Sky is doing is amazing.\n\nI don't know if you guys have been to a laundry mat, but it costs about 15 to $20 to do one load of washing. And I think this service is good, it's economical. They're helping people that are in need. Yeah they're always here. They're such a nice bunch of people. The volunteers are awesome to chat to.\n\nI'm friends with a few of the girls, so I think I've come away with lifelong bonds, and that's important. Cool. What what do you like different people have different perceptions of what the impact starts. Like from laundry to connection, to conversation to that sort of stuff. What was it?\n\nWhat is it for you? A bit of everything, but I think the social thing is a big thing for me. I think when you are struggling, whether you are homeless or. Whether you're just introverted or whatnot, being able to have other people to talk to and to [00:06:00] connect with is very important. Everything is energy and it's nice to have people with such good, uplifting spirits to talk to.\n\nYou get into some pretty interesting conversations with these guys, so it is good. It's nice to have like positive outlook and people that wanna see you do well and wanna help. And like I said. I think 80% of any job is just showing up. It's just being present and not worrying about the past, not worrying about the future.\n\nThey're interested in the here and now, and I think that's very important 'cause so people, so many people get lost in the past or worry about the future and it's just nice to have people that wanna talk to you in the moment, want to see what's going on in your life and, yeah. Do you think it matters that everyone's a volunteer rather than paid like, differentiation between the service and what support?\n\nYes, because the people want to be there. There's a difference in, I think being paid to go and do a job and having people that are volunteering their own time and energy and support to come and [00:07:00] help people, it is because they want to be here. They want to help the community.\n\nAnd that ma it does make a big difference because. They don't have to be here. They're doing it off their own backs, and I think that's very important. Yeah. Is, are there certain things around being a female that's different in terms of disadvantage or struggle or homelessness in your life?\n\nI think it's easy to be a homeless woman than what it would be to be a homeless man. And I say that because I think men are always taught to protect women and to try and help and serve and that sort of stuff. So I think just in general, women are better looked after than men and it's just, it's sad, but it's true.\n\nSo I, I don't really think it, it's that I have a disadvantage or an advantage. It is what it is because it also comes with, I guess the safety aspect of being a woman. But that's pretty much the only thing that I would say gives me a. Disadvantage, if you wanna call it that. But [00:08:00] I I doing a fair bit of work in youth justice and Tasmania's in a fascinating position.\n\nNow the youth center is this weird transition where they dunno what to do. Do you have perceptions on what is the government role in how they support young kids when they are in that position? I was in welfare and I was also in that detention center eight times. Like most institutions, I actually think they're breeding grounds for people that are not doing the correct thing.\n\nUnfortunately, people, people hired very well. And the Ashley's youth detention center was a very sad thing because there were so many young people throughout that period that were taken advantage of. My question is, how come it went unnoticed for so long? And even though that they know with, multiple accounts and multiple people having been arrested for not good [00:09:00] things, I wonder why it has not been addressed and why it's still, why it still is open. Because they know for a fact there's been multiple incidences there where, children were molested and raped and all sorts of things, I don't really see that the government has done anything other than chuck money at people.\n\nAnd to me that's just kinda like hush money. So it, it's effectively just created a cycle of trauma for probably everybody involved. And I think the issue is the government per se, can't really do anything about those issues. We need people that. Have, like I said, the education level has to be, it has to mirror the issue.\n\nSo I think the first thing that they should do is probably get counselors, get the people that are experiencing trauma dealing with these traumas to work alongside those kids. At the moment, I think what's not being addressed is that, that they're not even getting the right service help.\n\nSo I think that's the first thing [00:10:00] to addressing the issue. I think you touched on before a bit, like again, there, it's how do you provide like agency for people to do it themselves and how do you create things that are around participation? Do you see any of that happening within the.\n\nSocial sector over, not really. And that's probably the problem is that the access points for businesses to be able to come together to help in social issues like this. There, there's no funding for it. A, as you said about the volunteer thing, it's gotta be people that wanna be there, but people that aren't gonna abuse their power in those positions.\n\nAnd I think that's vital for this cycle of trauma to stop. It's having the right people to come together, to work together, to close the gap, so to speak, to create a service that can then be funded by the government. But I think we in the community need to do that. Maybe the government can supply the funding for things like that, but [00:11:00] ultimately it, it's the community that has to look after the people, yeah. Alright. Sky started, there's two young fellas in and got pretty big. Yeah. How, do you have any recommendations on how you think they can continue to stay true to themselves as they continue to grow? Like they'll, there's obviously a lot more interest in them and money and stuff. Like how do they stay?\n\nClose to. I think staying with the volunteer program will probably make it very effective in the way that the people that will jump on board are all gonna wanna be there. I think in terms of expansion for Orange Sky most of the people that I do know that work for Orange Sky are in other job positions as well.\n\nAnd so I guess just utilizing the skills that they have from those other jobs, transferable skills. Yeah. But, yeah, ones that, are going to empower young people because I think there's a difference between supporting someone and empowering someone. And I think that's what's gotta change.\n\nWe've gotta stop this. [00:12:00] We support stuff in the start empowering people, that's, yeah. Are there it's always difficult to talk about like really specific things that changed. Like your course. Were there different things that changed your course along the way? You said you've been in detention a few times.\n\nLike there certain scenarios that changed your course, even the better or worse? I think the things that affected me were emotional. I. Response. I think I would deal with things as a young person and I didn't understand my emotions or how to handle them. And I think from a early age I dealt with a lot of trauma from a very early age.\n\nAnd so I didn't have, I guess the best peer support systems and I didn't have very good role models around me. I learned through that, or I learned through making lots of mistakes. That you shouldn't punish yourself. And education really does matter. You think it doesn't when you are younger, but [00:13:00] when you're 16 or 18 and you can't function as an adult it does reflect in both your behavior and the way you look.\n\nYeah it's still down to the, what we teach people is emotional intelligence. It's, making informed decisions, but you need education to do that. And unfortunately we have a lot of fake teachers now. I remember I dropped out of college basically 'cause I wanted to become an accountant, but the teacher that was teaching it had never worked a day in their life as an accountant.\n\nAnd I think for me, I started questioning these organizations and institutions where they were expecting us to come and give our time to get certificates, et cetera. But the people that were teaching us. These subjects weren't actually qualified to be teaching these subjects and had no life experience in those roles.\n\nAnd so I think for me it was the hypocrisy of it all. Was that you got all these people teaching you to go into this job, they'd never done the job. How can he teach me to do something you've [00:14:00] never done? So education really does matter and, yeah, and I guess what I said earlier about the having people that don't abuse their power, I think a lot of people are given power and a lot of people misuse it.\n\nSo that's probably what I would say. Last few words about like hanging around this sort of shift like experience, like what's it feel like for a someone that doesn't know what it's like to hang. So if you've never been to Salvos or you've never worked with Orange Sky for me the social interaction is very important.\n\nIt is giving me a safe space in the community to talk about. My life and the things I'm wanting to do. And I guess, like I said, having pe like different people to touch base with and that have the experience, they can give me advice and, they can support, but empower me to also do the right things, and I think that's very important. And I, without having, yeah, without having that, support and empowerment. [00:15:00] I think I would be just going in the same cycles and the same loops. So it's nice to have someone to break the chain, so to speak. 'cause it does matter. You, I think people don't realise How important friends are? I feel like recently I've had to cut off a lot of my old friends because I want better for myself or I want better for my life. And Orange Sky and the Salvation Army have been a big help in me being able to be on the straight and narrow. It's given me somewhere safe to come.\n\nIt's given me a whole new social circle. So it's been good and it's yeah it's helped me a lot. It gives me somewhere safe to go and somewhere, supportive and be, they do a lot for the community, not just me. So it is nice. Anything we didn't touch on that you want to talk about or other things that you Not off the top of my head.\n\nOkay. I think that's it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. It was very nice. You did such a great [00:16:00] job. I'm just gonna take a little photo.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Keiron Lander Initial Interview\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nMy name's Keiron Lander. I'm a myth dairy man with connections. Threw my grandmother down to the JI people, my great-grandmother.\n\nI grew up in Western Queensland, a little town called Quipe, and congregated around Charville Ka Mulla Winda and my family are from Windorah originally moved up from a young age and to my uncles and aunties, grew up in a little house little. Two bedroom house, pink house or one bedroom, pink house in Windorah growing up in kpi.\n\nMy grandmother took full custody of me from an early age, so ended up in the higher courts and in foster care for about 18 months till she was able to secure me and my twin sister. And we were then eventually moved to corp with her and my grandfather, and then raised through. [00:01:00] The community and also my uncles and aunties primary school was about footy.\n\nAnd that, that's a lot of what I remember in fishing and going down the river and swimming. But primary school was a challenge too, from a learning perspective. I really struggled. I was good at certain things and the things that I weren't, I think I was disruptive would be a nice way to say it. Would be in a bit of trouble, fighting angry aggressive at times, but always, was taught, good manners, good values, family's important, those good cultural elements.\n\nIt grounded me and always aspired to, to be better, to either one day play for the Broncos as a young kid, or to be. To be a strong worker. And why is that? 'cause my uncles were really well respected in the community and abroad around [00:02:00] their work ethic and also what they gave back to the family, helping me and my grandmother and my sisters and their other nieces and nephews.\n\nSo yeah, grew up out at Quipe where I then focus on sports. I thought sports could be a vehicle that could help me and. To do that, I needed to move away. And other friends and family members were going away to boarding school and I saw that as an opportunity to go, Hey, I want to go. Therefore, I begged my grandmother to send me away and let me go to boarding school.\n\nAnd that no doubt, I had a lot of doubt is whether I could make it first week, let alone the whole term. And then five years, which I did. So graduated from Downlands College in Toowoomba. It wasn't without its challenges too, moving away from home to then being a boarding school, new people, different culture.\n\nThe school was exceptional. There [00:03:00] was some really good people there that sort of saw my potential and what I could do and what I could become. And they really focused on me being a good person, not a good sports person. I think that came later and. For me, like learning English, science I struggled at in primary school.\n\nSo that was always a challenge. My behavior, I wouldn't say was the greatest when I stepped into those classes, every reason to get out of them. But sports and maths and cooking, those sort of hands-on activities I really enjoyed. 'Cause I thought they were my strengths and then I, my values had to.\n\nSort of be realigned at times or bumped into place. 'cause I was quick to get into a fight or, stand my ground either with following peers or older kids or older personalities at school that I was quick to throw me fists up and I had to learn that wasn't the way to [00:04:00] act and behave.\n\nAnd that I needed to learn to control my temper and. Start to use other assets and again, bring to life the potential I had not fall back into those old habits. I would've been one of the first in my sort of cohort family members to finish year 12. And that was always something that was a goal of mine.\n\nAnd I would say the reason I stuck at it I saw that if I could do it. That would then influence my cousins or those around me to give it a go at least and see that we grew up together, similar backgrounds, similar experiences, and if you stick at it and put yourself around the right people and do the right thing, that good things can happen.\n\nAnd that school was really good. I had good mates that, still to this day that you know, have been at their weddings or. Got godparents and my kids and we still have, [00:05:00] strong connections and catch up either on phone or physically that those peers were good for me as well, and their parents and guardians became lost, mom and dad's to me as I was coming through.\n\nSo that was really good time in my life. And then I looked at then yeah, moving to Brizzy. At the age of 17 and progressing to what I thought was gonna be a first grade career. So yeah, ended up in Izzy. What do you want know Brisbane story? I reckon. Yeah. It's awesome. Like all of these all of these thematics carry through, I reckon.\n\nBe awesome. Maybe just to be like, what drove you to where you are now, which is like, what experiences did you have then? Moved you more towards this how do I support young people that I might have turned into or whatever? Yeah. How you draw that bow, I reckon. Yeah. I, at the time, obviously primary school, I had an older brother [00:06:00] that was with my biological mum and dad and I also then had two younger brothers come after me and my twin sister.\n\nAnd at different periods throughout, I suppose my primary school and high school, particularly my primary school age, we would go visit, my mom and dad and see my brothers, and my sort of memory of them were never really positive and they would always start off good. You catch up and as I remember, there'd be the, drinking a barbecue and an argument. And I remember on many occasions in Toowoomba and other places where we'd, me and my grandmother, my twin sister, are out on the street waiting for a taxi to go to the motel. It was a motel and I remember it well, cozy Motel.\n\nThey knew my grandmother and us very well. [00:07:00] And those experiences they shape you, and for me it was around, I didn't have the greatest connection with my brothers outside of seeing them in holidays and those things. As we got older, those experiences, I started to create sort of a perception of what I wanted and what I didn't.\n\nAnd I remember going down there one year and it was a Christmas in Toowoomba. And my grandmother come to pick us up to go home. And my mother, for the first time probably said, you, you just need to stay here. I didn't have a relationship with her, and so I pulled away and my grandmother, she just, she literally, jumped in the cab and just said, stay there.\n\nAnd that was quite hard. I think I was only 10 or 11. She come back with the police. And obviously she had custody rights of me and my twin sister. And I remember saying to her, I don't want to go back anymore because I I was over those [00:08:00] experiences, trying, my grandmother and my biological mother trying to make it work.\n\nAnd there was, I said there was, there would be drinking, there'd be fighting, and then there'd be us on the street gun, our motel as young kids. And lucky the Cozi Motel looked after us. But that experience then said no, I don't want that. And then I would hear the stories of my own brothers, in papers, stealing, breaking an entire, crime and going to juvenile detention here in Izzy.\n\nAnd that's always sat with me. What could I have done? Or what could you do? Or whatever it was. Which is hard. And I think as I've gotten older and you think how do I use my skills, my knowledge, my experience from the gifts I've been given by my grandmother and family members to give back?\n\nAnd that's essentially what I'm trying to [00:09:00] do is to look at how do I give back essentially to these young fellas that have had those experiences that there's a lot of doubt. Is there help? Is there good people? And to this day, my brothers are still either currently in prison or getting out and returning in small, small timeframe.\n\nAnd I can't help my brothers. I've tried I've reached out. I've also gotta protect my own family my own kids and morals and, so those boundaries have to stay there. And that's hard. And, my twin sisters the same though. I work hard to maintain some sort of relationship.\n\nRocky at times, and. But I'm always there when she needs or as much as I can without, impacting my own kids and wife, et cetera. So they're the main drivers for some of the work I do. I worked in health for 12 years. [00:10:00] I I worked in communities delivering sort of sports and health education where I see such wonderful personalities.\n\nThat light up a room and that all they're asking for is little help. And at the moment we're getting too many turning 17, 18 that are on their own. So yeah. So good mate. That was, that's awesome. There's something's happening I think at the moment, especially within Northern Territory in Queensland where a lot of the population have a theory of.\n\nTeach kids a lesson or almost there is a need to be tough. But what we're not hearing is tough. And what is the end, do you think? That we need to apply to the kids where yes, the kids need to understand what they've done, but then there's way more. People aren't talking about that we need to think about.[00:11:00] \n\nI think, I use the terminology fair and firm. Fair talks about all those ands, love respect, kindness, empathy, understanding, and trying to really lean on that fair. You can't be fair if you don't understand. You're not coming from a, from an understanding position if you're not fair.\n\nAnd fair then creates the means of how you navigate. Firm means you gotta have boundaries. There are our cultural values, there are rules in society to protect yourself and to protect others. And so if we get that balance between fair and firm, correct. Those young people respect themselves, they respect you.\n\nYou then start to build a strong relationship that creates accountability and accountability on your own actions, [00:12:00] not on theirs. My job is not to hold a young person or anyone to account, is to have a strong enough relationship so they feel like they're accountable to that relationship with a fair and firm perspective.\n\nHow do people that have the capacity to support young people get to that point? Are there steps that they take to understand things? Are there do they need to lean into conversations with young people, or is it hanging out with people like yourself to understand it more and then to slowly progress into how they can support what's their role, in, in this journey for the kids?\n\nI think, for anyone that wants to play a role. I think you've gotta get close to people that are already doing it right. And our young people are very smart, very intelligent, very resilient. I think all those things people don't see in them, where people like myself and, you've had some experience and even some colleagues of mine and Brody's a good example up in Mount Isa, [00:13:00] they have genuine, or what we say is a proper.\n\nUnderstanding of what it means just to make people feel like they're equal or they're the same by saying, hello, how are you? By not pushing an envelope of what you should or shouldn't do. Knowing young people need time and space, their current mindset is in survival. They're in a survival mindset.\n\nSo the. The barometer of protection is there all the time. Who are you? What do you want? What do you want from me? How can I trust you? And if they feel a little bit insecure in that relationship, they'll decline. I'll walk away. They'll get angry. They'll challenge you and you want them to challenge you because that's them being their selves.\n\nBut you also want 'em to slowly become resourceful in that challenge. [00:14:00] I'm not trying to create a fight. You put fuel on a fire. What do you create a bigger fire? How you take fuel away from a fire still, you don't want to deflate it 'cause that's them. That's what makes them who they are. But if someone's getting agitated, then I become more agitated.\n\nI'm actually just adding fuel to the agitation and probably what they've seen their whole life and versus, Hey, take a few minutes, go calm down, or come back and have a yarn and I'll give you my thoughts on this. And you share yours. 'cause that's how you create understanding right time and space. And again, go back to, it takes time to understand their journey, we work with these young people at the moment for six weeks, quite intensively, and it's probably not till the six week we start to go, wow. No wonder they struggle in this or are [00:15:00] great at this. But we see all the good things they're doing right. The levels of concentration sitting in a room for six to eight hours, they couldn't do that at school.\n\nWhy are they doing that here? Because I've created that connection, a sense of, hey, we are equals, we will learn from and with each other. But we'll go on this journey together. That is for you. There's there's so many people must be talking with that has the capacity to help these kids. What do you know, what journey they might go on as they start to scratch the service and spend more time with you and then actually be a partner and a supporter?\n\nWhat do you think they'll be doing to get there? Say a Aqua or Kmart or whatever. What journey will they go on as they start to understand. What impact they can have and the journey that, that they'll go on as a supporter or a partner. Yeah. [00:16:00] I think what we've got to change, and I think it's system change but also to the connection to the reality.\n\nLook, yes, we've got economic pressures and business pressures, or we've got wonderful small businesses that are looking after young people that have never been. Heard of working with some partialists and as an opportunity for young people and they've taken on a couple and these young people have pulled out quite quickly and some have gone on and excelled now being outta trouble for, more than four years I picked him up from court.\n\nNo two journeys are the same and no two expectations then should be. If we look at, the partners, whether local businesses, corporates, or others if you're really genuine about what, [00:17:00] what is happening and want to create the change that's necessary for young people, you gotta get close to it.\n\nStart walking beside them, start walking next to them, or start catching up with the people that are at the coalface of this challenge. But I think our greatest challenge is our greatest opportunity. We have a lot of young people, that are out there wanting to work. They're disconnected from that generic methods of employment.\n\nThe barriers have become so complex for them that it's confusing and frustrating versus actually what we're trying to do is start to address what your strengths are and work with you a bit. How do we use those strengths to. Mitigate and eliminate some of those barriers. And we're doing that.\n\nWe know we need more partners, but people in the coalface that are walking beside these young people, their moms and dads, their grandparents that might be looking after two or three of these young people they can't afford [00:18:00] to go to every service, nor do they wanna sit on a. A, a line talking about how you can possibly help my young person and then be referred to someone else and then be referred to someone else again.\n\nSo if we think of partnerships and collaboration is the You Butte word that's been happening for a long time. Start to think about what does real collaboration look like, feel like, sound that isn't restricted by KPIs, that isn't consumed by administration. 'cause there's a lot of waste, a lot of waste that can be going straight to a young person, getting an Uber to work to getting new steel cap boots, to have their first day on the job at a construction site.\n\nThose important. Parts of getting a job or going to [00:19:00] training or getting some work experience are the things that are mentally challenging young people. Should I pay for an Uber or should I get some food If I get paid today, can I go to work and afford cigarettes? People say you should have choice.\n\nIf you smoke from an early age, you're addicted. Yeah. First thing, you think something's gonna make me feel good. I'm not sure if work's going to the smokes might, right? We can't ask a young person to give up something that makes 'em feel good without giving them the education and supports and showing them there's a better way.\n\nOne, we have, you have a job, you can afford your cigarettes but you also can afford your essential living needs. And they're the elements we're trying to put around our young people. I think one thing that I was thinking about when you were talking about your journey was I think there was [00:20:00] regularly someone that showed up who was able to direct you or support you or be a mentor in some ways.\n\nHow does that play into what you are trying to do, are you filling a gap maybe that those young people don't have Someone that can, be someone they can aspire to or be supported by. And 'cause I think something I'm always interested in is like, mentoring is such a hard, like what a hard thing to resource, so intensive.\n\nLike how do you always create that support person for that young person and then almost, how do you know when they're getting enough of that? You know what I mean? When they're getting enough support and how do you manage that? I would argue everyone can be a mentor. So I would argue too that sometimes it's only res an I suppose, intensive resource at times till they're at a point where they can do it themselves on site.\n\nWe have mentors in the leaders, that are shaping how these young people learn on the job [00:21:00] and how they get better and giving them time. There's us doing the training, I think. The mentor component can be as little or as great as you want. I think what these young people are looking for is someone that they can trust that if they do something, they get it wrong, that they're gonna be shown how to get it right versus being told they're no good.\n\nNow, that's the cut rate of the labor market as well. If you get it wrong, too many times I'm losing money. Versus if I teach you to get it right, you're not only gonna have a career, but you're gonna be good for my business. Good for customers, good for clients. Too quick to cut people. I think the mentoring's one part of it, what we're seeing, and if you look at disengage young people at the moment, entering the justice system, it's activity, healthy activity where they can go learn and not learn for an hour.\n\nNot do a one hour [00:22:00] program that takes 'em outta home and picks them up at 10 o'clock and drops 'em back off at lunchtime. What are the activities or work experience or training initiatives that isn't classroom bound? I'm talking that activities that have tangible outcomes. You can see your value and your contribution every activity you do.\n\nAnd I share my own experience about. When I grew up in the bush and going to family's cattle stations or going out on the sheep stations and, panning up sheep rousing on the cattle station, checking boars, learning to drive a car, fencing, seeing, I would always see how I was contributing every minute, and I was rewarded for that.\n\nFinancially I was paid at a young age. We ate with all the other men and women. At the same [00:23:00] time, we were respected and we also learned what respect looked like, how the men and women would interact. So I had this really positive, environment. Where at a young age, and I'm talking, 10-year-old where I'd go out on a cattle station and one of the places was, or around that ra Quipe and the men and women would teach me, they would take me horse riding.\n\nWe would do Jim Kas. I couldn't afford a horse, but I rode in every event. Never won anything. But we would, we would go fencing and do kilometers of fencing, tying off fence, and you would see your work. You are contributing to the management of that place, right? You'd do dump runs, you'd fight over who could, who was driving the car, right?\n\nSo I learned that I was given [00:24:00] responsibility, therefore, I needed to uphold that responsibility and respect it. And so if we look at, mentoring played a role in that. Now they still had to work, but I was working. It wasn't extra. It was actually they teach, mentoring is about teaching those next year.\n\nLike your own. And I teach all these young people and care for them and guide them like they're my own son. I have the same conversation with my own son. And daughter as I would with these young people. And I think that's the hardest thing for any good mentor role model, or in our community.\n\nThat's the hardest thing. 'cause it hurts when bad things happen to them. Or we see, the bad side of things turning for them because home hasn't been good or they've ended up in a bad relationship. That's the stuff that hurts. That's the mentoring. That people or the psychological and the emotional wear on our people.\n\nIf you are a good mentor, you wear that every day, [00:25:00] right? But without the activity, we've got more young people bored. What happens with boredom? You find things to do. You get up to mischief, you got that much energy, and sometimes anger because that's that survival mindset. That you're just looking to destroy something or be destructive and you're self-destructive in many ways.\n\nAnd stealing a car is one of those things here in some of the big regional and urban settings. Breaking in, you're getting a thrill. What about give this thrill about, Hey, I am contributing at work or in this goal and I'm now getting a reward for it. I'm seeing the outcome, I'm getting paid for it.\n\nI've got people here that love, care, and respect me. I've got people here that are teaching me. And so those attributes that I grew up with and those qualities that I learned is what we're trying to instill here, right? And what our community members are [00:26:00] trying to instill. All right. Got a couple of minutes.\n\nYou're gonna nail this one. What's like the ideal partnership or support or collaboration for you in, in, in getting this moving, like what? What's gonna be able to create a 'cause the one thing I see in community with organizations is it's this almost like an addiction to trying to find grants or money or, and it take, it turns into a full-time, like stress.\n\nWhat's, what for you creates this roadmap where you can then do the work, Jeff, do the work and be supported by by people. I wouldn't say, it's a hard question. I think our people have been saying it for a long time, let our people do the work. And we talk about, and we've been talking about this for a while, is creating a custodian economy where custodian businesses, custodian organizations come together to resource the biggest challenges and the greatest opportunities in our [00:27:00] communities.\n\nSo creating a custodian economy that isn't reliant on. A funding or a policy to make the change. We can't put all eggs in one basket to say, government, you have to change this. The change will come from us and if we can't change it, what would I expect anyone else to do it? So my, my belief and the belief of a few others that I've talked to is we gotta create a new system and one that our people.\n\nAnd I think it's a reflection of something that I hold dear to my heart is the health sector's done. This health sector in Australia has been, I would say, the greatest change in health or primary healthcare to our people in 200 years. And it's only 50 years old and it was because our people came together.\n\nCollaboratively to make the change, to change the system. And so we're seeing [00:28:00] our quality of life improve, in, in our chronic disease management plans, address the needs of individuals or what role can we play from an economic point of view and take those cultural learnings which it is.\n\nIt's a community led. And a regional approach, which then became an Australian approach to improving healthcare and quality of life of our people to then do that same model in an economic sense. That's cool. 'Cause that's your, that's that whole pitch there. We've gotta give back right. I'm trying to think of what's like the, 'cause that's awesome to have that like reference to health as well. Is it, have you been I guess you've been thinking about like vision is there something in your mind where, how big this needs to be over five years or is there some kind of roadmap that you're considering as to how much resource you need or how many people you need on board with this?\n\nOr is [00:29:00] that still Yeah, so I think at the moment. Just within you, leveraging young guns. Young guns has played a pivotal role in what we're trying to do here at the moment. Low barrier, entry level employment, connection to community and community connected to proper employment opportunities that don't have all the barriers they face every day to look at rolling, we've been in Queensland rolling this out, nationally, we'd be looking around that sort of six to 7 million.\n\nYeah, to over a three year period target around 400 to 500 young people. If that could quickly double. And I think that's only to focus on employment pathways. If we are really fed income about what we're gonna do, we're gonna, we're gonna have to raise more money. And I reckon the economy is a contribution to now create affordable housing.\n\nThat supports a young per person and their employment [00:30:00] opportunity how many Ubers do you gotta pay for that could be contributed to paying off a small car loan? How do we ensure that a young person's first two weeks they've got food security? That's not hard. That's not a big expense.\n\nAnd so for us, it's around even looking at where the economic opportunity is. Where young people can get a start and contribute and actually help facilitate the activity to then grow that economy to then feed that economy back into feeding the most disadvantaged young people in our community.\n\nAnd if we do that, we have generational change. 'cause they're now growing up with jobs, renting a house, affording cars, food security. Having a job will improve your quality of life tenfold versus giving up smoking. Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't give up smoking, however, there's so [00:31:00] much more financial choice, financial stability, health, wellness.\n\nThere's, there is strong evidence that says someone having a job improves your mental health, right? 'cause you've got purpose. Job doesn't provide purpose. The job feeds your purpose to provide for your family to do the things you want to do in life, to have an enjoyable lifestyle. And so if we can create economies that help ignite young people's purpose and they can see that a job rewards their purpose, not is their purpose, unpacking shipping containers isn't a great job.\n\nDigging holes and planting trees, yeah. But it's a means to serve your life. So if we can start to ignite purpose in young people, to then influence having a job conserve you and your family and your loved ones. 'cause [00:32:00] it's talk to all our people. What do they want? They want family. They wanna buy things that they enjoy.\n\nThey wanna be able to afford the things that make 'em feel good, which includes good meals, right? Yeah. And so we've gotta be able to now then how do we use the economy to serve the community better? So good mate, there's so many grabs there.\n\n",

Mum's up in Queensland. I clap. I told her not to get there. Alright, I've got some riggle room to play with here. Oh, cold there. Oh, she's gone. It'll be shitty.

C-A-N-P-I-U-N. Yeah. Awesome. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. I've been, up until last week, I've been homeless for first of about a month. Before that I was in temporary accommodation where there was limited, limited services. In regards to cooking, washing, that kind of thing.<�/p> <�p>Basically go to bed, wake up, go spend the day walking around. Yeah. Before that. Yeah. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> What did you need? I was, in a couple of share houses that never worked out. So it led me to temporary accommodations. That temporary accommodation ran out. Like I said, back to homelessness. And then last week I ended up receiving good news from Department of Housing, getting it my own place.<�/p> <�p>Wow. But I still haven't got the washing machine, so I've just, I've spent the last two nights, the last two nights just sleeping on the floor and a sleeping bag. It's good. It's my own place now. I just need to start gathering all the bits and pieces. Cool. How'd you first hear about Orange Sky?<�/p> <�p>Through St. Benedict's Community Center, actually. I've been coming here for a fair bit probably over a year and a half. I've used the service quite a few times. It's fantastic. Yeah, it'll be lost there. Lost without it, with those Saint Benedict as well. Good support network in. You've got St.<�/p> <�p>Benedict, you've got Salvation Army, you got St. Pins of the <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> poor, and of course you got Orange Sky. A homeless girl. Yeah. Without services. You'd be walking around stinky. A bit of it's like service, but then a bit of it's like connection and conversation. What do you think about that in terms of the difference between just getting something done and having some community?<�/p> <�p>It's good. No, that, that's a good point. You can have a chat with the crew here, the volunteers, your cup of tea and the chat and. It's good for your mental wellbeing. You have a yarn, have a laugh. You are here at, different ideas and different, some other services that may be able to help.<�/p> <�p>Yeah, it's a good connection, good network. What. Do you think of this idea of collaboration between Orange Sk\n",

It's fabulous. And, yeah.\n\nWhy Hobart? What's fabulous about it? I grew up on the Eastern shore. And as I've gotten older, I've realized like to live next to two beaches is a lifestyle that people in Sydney pay gazillions for, and I don't have to. And so to just. To, it's just a beautiful place. We've got everything we need, we've got the mountain there, we've got the river there, one of the seventh natural deepest harbors in the world.\n\nJust in case you need to know that. And I've lived overseas and as much as all these other places are lovely. How about wind? Say again with me. How'd you first hear about Orange Sky? I heard it on the telly and I didn't [00:02:00] really know, like I heard about the two teenage boys don't do their own washings suddenly washing for other people.\n\nAnd I'm like, oh, that's funny. But I used to work. With a girl who had the jumper on one day and I quizzed her 'cause I can't help my mouth. And she was telling me how she actually volunteered, like Thursday nights she'd go from work and volunteered just out in the city. And I always wanted to do it because it just seems like a nice thing to do.\n\nAnd then four years ago I got more time in my life. Mum passed away, so I was like, got time to fill in, got stuff to give aggressively helpful some of my friends say. So I got to be aggressively helpful here. What what keeps you coming back to Orange Sky staying here? Like the guys that I work with we do Sunday mornings.\n\nIt's, they're nice people. Like some of them are just so sweet and generous and nice and these guys like, [00:03:00] they've got, it doesn't matter what's happening in my world, this is always gonna be harder than anything I have to do. So why not give 'em three hours? It's no skin off my nose. What do you think the impact of Orange Sky is across the different domains?\n\nSo there's washing, there's connection, there's conversation, there's partnership. What's in your mind? What's stands out for you? I look it's the connections that, like some of these guys and, we'll only speak to them for 20 minutes and potentially not see them again. But some of them are just so sweet and they just wanna chat and I'm bang up for a chat.\n\nSo why wouldn't, like, why not have a chat and. And when I see them in town, I work in the city during the week, and you see people ignore them and. That just feels mean and I mean it's life, so whatever, it's just nice to give a bit of my time to [00:04:00] them. And the washing's good.\n\n'cause no one ever wants to do their own washing. Okay. What sort of conversations do you have with either friends, family, public, around our. Always an easy or difficult conversation or what any conversation with me is easy. So I just tell people and it just, some people say, oh, maybe it's time to give it up.\n\nHaven't you done enough? And it's it's three hours a week. And I've say to people, anyone can do it. It's not a big deal in your life. It's, it's such an easy thing to do, but people just don't. I don't think people register.\n\nI think people don't register that they can help. Beyond just their immediate family. And as well as some people, I only want to help if they can put it up on social media. I don't do any of that. I don't care. But yeah, I've, I did get, I've only once has someone actually stopped me and said, oh, do you [00:05:00] do that?\n\nAnd I was like, yeah. Yeah. And I had a chat with this bloke and he was down in Hobart. He was up from down from Queensland, and he is yeah, I used to do it. He said, now I donate to them. I don't do it anymore, but I donate. And I'm like, that's lovely. That's cool. Yeah. And when I arrived you were deep in conversation with Felicity and Yeah.\n\nLike having a gun. Yeah. What stood out from Felicity's story? Anything for you or is, was that like a unique conversation, a normal conversation or unique in that Felicity's obviously gone through? Everyone's gone through a lot. Yeah. But Felicity's gone through such a specific thing and like Felicity being tall and a friend of mine, her middle child is a six three transgender.\n\nFemale. Transition. I don't know all the right words. Apologies. Transition at 18, but always knew before that. But such a quiet, [00:06:00] meek person. Meek's not the right word. Just a quiet personality and hearing Felicity talk like some awful stuff, but such a strong person. And it's that's nice to hear.\n\nAnd I also wanna hug everyone. And I think what stood out for me was the surprise of the services available, but also the genuine love of what it's, is that something that is normal for friends to be so connected to it or everyone has their different story, massive mixed bag like.\n\nOne of everything kind of thing. We had a guy that used to come here who was, I called him the geologist I can't remember what it was, but he'd done everything like he was super smart, so many smart, like really intelligent, highly intelligent people here who use words that I sit there and go. In all my years of schooling, I like, [00:07:00] I know I've heard it, but I don't understand it.\n\nLike so many smart people. That's actually probably very eye opening to me because when I grew up, it's like you go to school, you go to college, you go to uni, you do all these things because then you can achieve in life. And these kids are saying, yeah, I went to, really expensive schools.\n\nAnd then you're talking to them going, mate, what happened? How did the, you know, it just, so I try to not, I know afterwards I do, but I try not to think about that at the time because I just, yeah, just, I don't know. I'm just waffling now. Great. That was good. Waffling. Yeah. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you feel is important or things that have stood out with Orange Sky that we didn't talk about?\n\nNo. What's the, any other vibes of volunteers, any like tips for Nick and Lucas around how to be better leaders or oh God, I always have an opinion. That's [00:08:00] terrible. I just, I wish more people, I don't know how you get more people to know about it and care about it. 'cause there's so many things that everybody cares about at the minute and there's.\n\nThere's so many new diseases being raised money for, and ice bucket challenge and whatever. Like how do you get to be the one that everyone cares about? And like in Hobart, they're talking about this stadium and then someone goes, but what about all the people that need houses?\n\nAnd it's it's a hard one. It's a big one. I don't, I'm, yeah. Selfishly I'm doing a lot of work in youth justice and yeah. Detention center here is a cluster of everything. So I yeah. I genuinely find some of these things just too hard to even think about because it just, it hurts my brain and my heart too much.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You're not doing as bad as Queensland and mentee there. Yeah. That's nice to know. It's terrible, but it's nice to know. But yeah, I just, that's amazing. Just stay there for a quick [00:09:00] photo.\n\nI'm just gonna clap my hands because it helps me sync the cameras up. Alright, I think we're rocking. Just look at me. Yep. First of all, just your full name and spell it. Spell it? Yeah. Just say your full name and spell it. My name's Sarah Jessica Meyers. S-A-R-A-H-I-R-E-L-N. A and d No, I'm terrible at spelling.\n\nNo, that's okay. I wasn't expecting that. Sorry. Oh, that was a head fuck. I've gotta but my full name is Sarah Jessica Meyer. So just tell me a little bit about yourself at the beginning. I originally grew up in wa. I moved to Tasmania in 2006 with my parents through, I guess a relationship breakdown with my parents.\n\nI ended up in the welfare [00:10:00] system. I, by the time I think I was 14, I was a offending and hanging out with some not good so good people, which resulted with me getting incarcerated quite a number of times. By the time I was 16, I'd broken out of that cycle of bad behavior and I guess addiction.\n\nI suffered with addiction issues when I was younger and it's led into homelessness as an adult. So it's my story. When I was 19, I got into my first relationship and. We had a good relationship for a number of years before it turned sour. But through that period I actually went and did my youth work, cert four and ended up working for council for a little while.\n\nSo there's many bad things that I have experienced. I've always tried to do the right thing and educate myself in ways that I can better look after myself and the community. And yeah, that's what. Just tell [00:11:00] me at any point, or you don't wanna answer something, but what are some of those lessons you think that stand out the most from believe in yourself?\n\nI think that's the biggest thing that I've taken out of this, is that everyone has different problems. We all come from different walks of life, and sometimes you've just gotta be there for yourself instead of looking for outside validation. You should recognize that you are the most important person in your life and that only you can help you, I think a lot of people seek outside validation to help themselves when really it's about going inwards, not outwards.\n\nAnd I think that's probably the best thing that I've learned is to work on yourself. And it honestly never stops. You'll always be learning. But it's that courage to try and it's that courage to wanna do better. I think the one thing that stands out straight away from the first part of your story is, bravery and you being able to [00:12:00] tell that story, I think that's important.\n\nBut then there's also experience in which you pass on. What are some of the ways in which you are working to pass on your experience to support other people that might like you guys? I think just being there for people. I think experience wise I know what it was like as a young person, not to have someone there, and so I think just showing up and being present, being there for people when they need it, everyone has different problems my ability to help my only just be advice and sending 'em in the right direction with someone who has that.\n\nInformation so that they can make an informed decision about what they're doing and not make a decision based from fear and being alone. Because I think a lot of the time that is what happens. People internalize their struggles and they make emotional decisions rather than rational ones.\n\nI think a lot of the curriculum, I think if we taught emotional intelligence and things like that in the schools, it would help a lot, for people to be able to navigate their own. [00:13:00] Problems. Yeah. I think most of the population has a very surface level of these words. Homelessness or struggle or disadvantage.\n\nWhat is it, what does that mean to you? Are those types of are they stigma? Are they worth connect with? How's that? Me and my friends argue about this all the time because I think homelessness is a choice. You can choose to wanna be a better person or you can choose to buy into the addictions and these things that were fed by society.\n\nBut it is a choice. And like I said emotional intelligence and having the ability to make an informed decision got will take you a lot further. And so I think education at the very basic. Level is a fundamental thing that needs to change in our country because without education you can't make an informed decision.\n\nSo I think that is really where we need to start the reform process really of education and the curriculum and what we're [00:14:00] teaching children and young people, because otherwise we'll stay, we stay stuck. What is special or interesting about the stuff that Orange Sky is doing as a service? I think what Orange Sky is doing is amazing.\n\nI don't know if you guys have been to a laundry mat, but it costs about 15 to $20 to do one load of washing. And I think this service is good, it's economical. They're helping people that are in need. Yeah they're always here. They're such a nice bunch of people. The volunteers are awesome to chat to.\n\nI'm friends with a few of the girls, so I think I've come away with lifelong bonds, and that's important. Cool. What what do you like different people have different perceptions of what the impact starts. Like from laundry to connection, to conversation to that sort of stuff. What was it?\n\nWhat is it for you? A bit of everything, but I think the social thing is a big thing for me. I think when you are struggling, whether you are homeless or. Whether you're just introverted or whatnot, being [00:15:00] able to have other people to talk to and to connect with is very important. Everything is energy and it's nice to have people with such good, uplifting spirits to talk to.\n\nYou get into some pretty interesting conversations with these guys, so it is good. It's nice to have like positive outlook and people that wanna see you do well and wanna help. And like I said. I think 80% of any job is just showing up. It's just being present and not worrying about the past, not worrying about the future.\n\nThey're interested in the here and now, and I think that's very important 'cause so people, so many people get lost in the past or worry about the future and it's just nice to have people that wanna talk to you in the moment, want to see what's going on in your life and, yeah. Do you think it matters that everyone's a volunteer rather than paid like, differentiation between the service and what support?\n\nYes, because the people want to be there. There's a difference in, I think being paid to go and do a job and having people that are volunteering their own time and [00:16:00] energy and support to come and help people, it is because they want to be here. They want to help the community.\n\nAnd that ma it does make a big difference because. They don't have to be here. They're doing it off their own backs, and I think that's very important. Yeah. Is, are there certain things around being a female that's different in terms of disadvantage or struggle or homelessness in your life?\n\nI think it's easy to be a homeless woman than what it would be to be a homeless man. And I say that because I think men are always taught to protect women and to try and help and serve and that sort of stuff. So I think just in general, women are better looked after than men and it's just, it's sad, but it's true.\n\nSo I, I don't really think it, it's that I have a disadvantage or an advantage. It is what it is because it also comes with, I guess the safety aspect of being a woman. But that's pretty much the only thing that I would say gives me a. [00:17:00] Disadvantage, if you wanna call it that. But I I doing a fair bit of work in youth justice and Tasmania's in a fascinating position.\n\nNow the youth center is this weird transition where they dunno what to do. Do you have perceptions on what is the government role in how they support young kids when they are in that position? I was in welfare and I was also in that detention center eight times. Like most institutions, I actually think they're breeding grounds for people that are not doing the correct thing.\n\nUnfortunately, people, people hired very well. And the Ashley's youth detention center was a very sad thing because there were so many young people throughout that period that were taken advantage of. My question is, how come it went unnoticed for so long? And even though that they know with, multiple accounts and multiple people having [00:18:00] been arrested for not good things, I wonder why it has not been addressed and why it's still, why it still is open. Because they know for a fact there's been multiple incidences there where, children were molested and raped and all sorts of things, I don't really see that the government has done anything other than chuck money at people.\n\nAnd to me that's just kinda like hush money. So it, it's effectively just created a cycle of trauma for probably everybody involved. And I think the issue is the government per se, can't really do anything about those issues. We need people that. Have, like I said, the education level has to be, it has to mirror the issue.\n\nSo I think the first thing that they should do is probably get counselors, get the people that are experiencing trauma dealing with these traumas to work alongside those kids. At the moment, I think what's not being addressed is that, that they're not even getting the right service help.\n\nSo [00:19:00] I think that's the first thing to addressing the issue. I think you touched on before a bit, like again, there, it's how do you provide like agency for people to do it themselves and how do you create things that are around participation? Do you see any of that happening within the.\n\nSocial sector over, not really. And that's probably the problem is that the access points for businesses to be able to come together to help in social issues like this. There, there's no funding for it. A, as you said about the volunteer thing, it's gotta be people that wanna be there, but people that aren't gonna abuse their power in those positions.\n\nAnd I think that's vital for this cycle of trauma to stop. It's having the right people to come together, to work together, to close the gap, so to speak, to create a service that can then be funded by the government. But I think we in the community need to do that. Maybe the government can supply [00:20:00] the funding for things like that, but ultimately it, it's the community that has to look after the people, yeah. Alright. Sky started, there's two young fellas in and got pretty big. Yeah. How, do you have any recommendations on how you think they can continue to stay true to themselves as they continue to grow? Like they'll, there's obviously a lot more interest in them and money and stuff. Like how do they stay?\n\nClose to. I think staying with the volunteer program will probably make it very effective in the way that the people that will jump on board are all gonna wanna be there. I think in terms of expansion for Orange Sky most of the people that I do know that work for Orange Sky are in other job positions as well.\n\nAnd so I guess just utilizing the skills that they have from those other jobs, transferable skills. Yeah. But, yeah, ones that, are going to empower young people because I think there's a difference between supporting someone and empowering someone. And I think that's [00:21:00] what's gotta change.\n\nWe've gotta stop this. We support stuff in the start empowering people, that's, yeah. Are there it's always difficult to talk about like really specific things that changed. Like your course. Were there different things that changed your course along the way? You said you've been in detention a few times.\n\nLike there certain scenarios that changed your course, even the better or worse? I think the things that affected me were emotional. I. Response. I think I would deal with things as a young person and I didn't understand my emotions or how to handle them. And I think from a early age I dealt with a lot of trauma from a very early age.\n\nAnd so I didn't have, I guess the best peer support systems and I didn't have very good role models around me. I learned through that, or I learned through making lots of mistakes. That you shouldn't punish yourself. And education really does matter. [00:22:00] You think it doesn't when you are younger, but when you're 16 or 18 and you can't function as an adult it does reflect in both your behavior and the way you look.\n\nYeah it's still down to the, what we teach people is emotional intelligence. It's, making informed decisions, but you need education to do that. And unfortunately we have a lot of fake teachers now. I remember I dropped out of college basically 'cause I wanted to become an accountant, but the teacher that was teaching it had never worked a day in their life as an accountant.\n\nAnd I think for me, I started questioning these organizations and institutions where they were expecting us to come and give our time to get certificates, et cetera. But the people that were teaching us. These subjects weren't actually qualified to be teaching these subjects and had no life experience in those roles.\n\nAnd so I think for me it was the hypocrisy of it all. Was that you got all these people teaching you to go into this job, they'd never done the job. [00:23:00] How can he teach me to do something you've never done? So education really does matter and, yeah, and I guess what I said earlier about the having people that don't abuse their power, I think a lot of people are given power and a lot of people misuse it.\n\nSo that's probably what I would say. Last few words about like hanging around this sort of shift like experience, like what's it feel like for a someone that doesn't know what it's like to hang. So if you've never been to Salvos or you've never worked with Orange Sky for me the social interaction is very important.\n\nIt is giving me a safe space in the community to talk about. My life and the things I'm wanting to do. And I guess, like I said, having pe like different people to touch base with and that have the experience, they can give me advice and, they can support, but empower me to also do the right things, and I think that's very important. And I, without having, yeah, [00:24:00] without having that, support and empowerment. I think I would be just going in the same cycles and the same loops. So it's nice to have someone to break the chain, so to speak. 'cause it does matter. You, I think people don't realise How important friends are? I feel like recently I've had to cut off a lot of my old friends because I want better for myself or I want better for my life. And Orange Sky and the Salvation Army have been a big help in me being able to be on the straight and narrow. It's given me somewhere safe to come.\n\nIt's given me a whole new social circle. So it's been good and it's yeah it's helped me a lot. It gives me somewhere safe to go and somewhere, supportive and be, they do a lot for the community, not just me. So it is nice. Anything we didn't touch on that you want to talk about or other things that you Not off the top of my head.\n\nOkay. I think that's it. Yeah. Thank you [00:25:00] very much. Thank you. It was very nice. You did such a great job. I'm just gonna take a little photo.\n\n",

How are the people that come here to get their washing done? Are they alright? Yep. Is there a bit of too much trouble? No. It goes alright? No, it goes alright. They want to get their clothes washed. Yeah. How long have you been doing this for? Well, since July last year. And what's it feel like to you to do it? No. Normal. I don't know. Just everyday work. Yeah. It's, from what I could see, you were just going at it the whole time. Like you didn't stop coming. Yeah, true. That's what I mainly asked you if I'd feed all that, you know. They'd just come out. But Kive already grabbed it, you know, a little black Eagle Man, yeah. So that's alright. And what community are you from? Are you from this one? No, Nudgew down the road, Norseman. And how far is that? About 100 something Ks down the road. And do you live there? No, no, I used to live there when I was growing up. What's it like, I suppose, being away from community? Do you get to go back there much? I have been down again, yeah. What do you do there? Town, Norseman town. It's a town, Norseman. I used to work on the mines up there, but then, yeah, come up this way and then went. Kimberley's worked up there for four and a half years. Life without barriers. Yeah, good company. What made you pick this up? Like how did you find RS Guy and what made you come and start working here? Mateo's working around there, but Stewie does. But he is working there, so I was going to go. NDIS, I was going to work for them. Yeah, but Stewie, yeah. He came to be pastor, so I've this church here. Yeah, so I looked for another person, so they put me on. Can you give us a tour of this thing? What's the deal with it? What happens? Nothing, just wash, dry, wash, dry and dry. How do you set it up? Yeah, put all the hoses, nah. Just get two hoses there, put it out. Just get the extensions out. And then the cord for the power goes there and just the hose, that's all. For the water tap, as long as you've got the water tap, it's got that hose there. And how many, sorry, how many loads do you do? Nah, right here, I think about 30. Yep, 30 at the moment. What's your average day look like in terms of how many washes? 34. They'll usually have it all here waiting for me, so. Yeah, I just start here about sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning, just come and just smash it out. What other services are here? What other stuff happens here? Which other? What other services are here? Like what other stuff can people access at this spot here? Right here, the truck and the, oh, Begum have come down for food and that patrol truck, they organise feed too. Yeah. They organise feed too, like every, some day do it every Tuesday, like Begum today, they'll probably do it next week and then, yeah. They all take turns and cook Tuesdays. And Jack of Tobacco, my babies come down on Mondays too, just to, yeah, cook up. Yeah, so. And what time do you reckon you're going to be able to pull up? Haha, all depends, yeah. All depends. All depends. So, leave some, leave some, I'll leave Tracey's dry couple, but the other community out there, I'll just take it out to them. I'll just take it out to them and I'll just chuck it on dry out there.\n**Day 2 transcript**\nMate, can't get you to sit down, eh? Why, why? I'm interested about this joint. Like, when I went for a walk, there was like lots of rubbish everywhere. How do you think it gets distributed so widely around here? Like, the wind, or like... Well, I don't know. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . all these stuff and move this. Ah, Mandra. Because you've got a daughter up there. Yeah. It's massive now. It's a big prison. Yeah. That worked as an activity officer. Oh, really? Mm. What's it like out there? It's all right. Yeah? Yeah, but it's small compared to now. Mm. Gotcha. Mm. I do a lot of work in prisons, isn't it? Right. Especially you. Mm. Mm. Now you. Perfect. Yeah. Mm. And the old blokes keep going back there. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. The whole prison officer's like, stay away. He does something. Mm. Mm. And they put you in a wheelchair, so go up and down. Like, you know. Mm. Those cowers have to go up there. I didn't think they did, they didn't mind going back, they got a pair of shoes, pair of gongs, a new pair of like pants. Yeah. Especially in winter time, you just might go back. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's cold outside, so. Oh. Scripture though. It cost a government. Would t they go up and down? Because the government's so much money for them to do. They've been in youth detention. It's about a million dollars for each young person in the first three years. It's crazy. It must be weird having a young father in prison. Is it weird or is it fine? How do you deal with that? We've got to learn to get out, get his mind set. I keep telling him, he's a good chef, you know. Get a job. You're doing a course, at the moment you finish it off. So when you get out, as I said, go and get a job. Chef job. They look around. So you're married or what? Divorced. Divorced? All the kids from one lady? Yeah. Mandra. You can teach him some lessons about that too. Make sure he doesn't learn from me. He'll get tired. No. No. Half-back. You know, two boys, the oldest is in a wheelchair, and the youngest wheelchair too. Oh, really? In between, yeah. What happened? They said it was Troy syndrome. With muscular sore on the muscles. Oh, okay. Hmm. Do they care? Or do they look after themselves? Well, the mother look after them, yeah. Oh, okay. There's a lot of that stuff around here, right? Like different health stuff. Yeah. What's your plans then? To keep your own art style and hang it out? Or you got other plans to do other stuff? I think I'll do it at the end of the year. And think about telling kids, oh, if you look at this other person, I know the whole might just, you know, take off. Yeah. Yeah. Because usually we have two weeks holiday. Bega gives us two weeks holiday. Oh, okay. Two weeks here. And we just take four weeks to keep going. Do you only get two weeks a year? Or what do you get? No, we get all leisure days and all that during the day. Two weeks. Good pay at the end of Christmas time. Christmas time. That's good, eh? Yeah. I think that's the only company that does it. At the moment. Usually people like to take holidays. Nah, they just give you, they say, you've got two weeks off. And people always take another two, you know. So they have four weeks off. So Bega must be a big company, eh? Yeah. What's their main stuff? Is it everything? Everything? Yeah, everything. They've got all the Ningila, virtual training, you know, train people up. NDIS. Boys out and about, you know. Tobacco mob there. Yeah. What's tobacco? They kind of just do like... Primate, all that. Tobacco stuff, yeah. Do they have any sexual stuff? I don't know. I don't know. They used to have this condom man in that house. Oh yeah, seen that bloke. Oh yeah? Yeah, on that TV and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very from Queensland. Yeah, that guy. Yeah, it was a Queensland thing, yeah. Yeah, I was up in Antalya for years. I was through building a new building. Yeah. I wouldn't mind going to Tamworth and have a look. Oh yeah? I wouldn't mind going there, yeah. Country music? Nah, not country. I just love the country atmosphere, you know, when you're going out and about. Yeah. I'm a cult too, about me. Really? I play there every time. Kids grow up on it. Even the grannies, they all know that my music. I saw Jimmy Barnes at the Red Dust Festival. Oh, right. Have you heard of that? They do this big run into the centre of Australia. Do you know Birdsville? No, I haven't heard of it. It's a tiny town, but they have the really famous horse races there. Birdsville races. And it's like, it's kind of like, where is it? You know where Mount Isa is? Yeah. It's about 200km from Mount Isa. But yeah, Jimmy Barnes, they've got this big sand gym, and then they have this big music festival in front of it. And Jimmy Barnes was the headliner of that. Yeah. I like old general as well. But I'm from, do you know Musselbrook? It's near Tamworth. Which is a little town called Musselbrook. It's a coal mining town actually. That's where I'm from. Yeah. And then I went to university in Arbor Valley. Yeah. Machine gun. Which is pretty neat in Tamworth. Yeah. Uh. We used to play football against each other. This road, is to over there. That's um, Maria. On the show. Oh yeah, that's her. Yeah. This one there, I've got to put it in a bag for you. Put it in a bag. Yeah. Family. What's culture mean to you? How do you connect with it? What's it about? I only got involved with it because the mission days, you got stuck in a mission. Stolen generation. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think about that stuff a lot? Or is it just there? Or is it just there? Do you think about that stuff a lot? Or is it just there? Yeah, all the family talk about it and all that. Yeah. But it's been demolished in Northman through the old people years ago. Yeah, so. There's a long way from this way here, they still go past that way. Hmm. And you have a big family around here? Hmm. I'm a mother's side and my father's side. You can grow that by day or do you? South Australia. How was it? Maralinga. It's all family was there. They pushed away with a bomb blast, you know, testing nuclear bombs. Yeah. Did you have a lot of family that got sick from that stuff? Wow. Have a lot of family that got sick from all that? Yeah. Yeah, from that side, yeah. They just blast without checking if any people was living there. Oh no. Yeah. Taking all that things still there, all that buildings and all that. Yeah. Hmm. How did you first hear about this iron squad thing then? Someone. I don't know if Judas came over. Someone came over to talk about it. Hmm. I don't know if it was Judas or what. I was working for maintenance at the moment then. Big maintenance, yeah. Oh. Why did you, did you apply or was it pros or was it starting? No. They just asked me if I wanted to do it. Because it was moving. Hmm. Yeah, everybody knew I was going to go NDS. Right. Hmm. And how long has it been since you started? Like, you've been a year now. Yeah, full on. What do you reckon? You're still here. Yeah. Hmm. What do you reckon? What do you like about it? Oh. I suppose seeing all the family of it, I suppose. The majority of them. Yeah. We've made those, I hardly see any, but I just go around in a little circle, you know. Yeah, each building. Yeah, so. It's funny, like, in Western sort of thinking, and I just go, like, and sit around and have a yarn, whatever, but I think it's like, do you reckon it's like a different type of connection here with family? Like, you have a little yarn, and people cruise around, and they come back, and... Yeah, they come past, have a yarn, and cruise around somewhere else, another one comes. Yeah, so. Do they ever tell you how much they like it, or why they like it, or just like it's known, or? Every now and again they... Well, but I know they like it. No, but... talking about it, you know, they just, they know. Hmm. What's, um... Can you walk us through all the places you go to? Hmm. Down by Church of Christ, you know, Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday here, then Ningamiah, Bowler Camp tomorrow. Thursdays. Back Friday, Church of Christ. Usually do the Saber Up Shelter, but hardly anybody went there, see? Yeah, so. I was bringing up Judith's wife and telling her, I might as well change our location. Yeah, we was gonna go short stay. But then, yeah, went to, um... . Hmm. Yeah, oh, true. Now, I'm not sure I'm gonna finish until it comes up. Hmm. Hmm. I know that number. Hmm. Hmm. Tell us, everyone's been talking a lot about this Bowler Camp thing. Can you describe it for me? What's it look like? Oh. Oh, I got that wrong. Okay. Where are you from originally? Norseman. Norseman, just in a road. What's your, um, country, like, what's your... Nudju. Nudju. Nudju. Hmm. How, like, connected are you with that, like, you? Other side. Hmm. Hmm. Do you, like, do you practice culture? Are they, like, strong? No, they went out yontago, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. . . . . No. You're on there. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Oh, I'm sorry.\n# **The Quiet Guardian of Dignity: Phillip and Orange Sky in Kalgoorlie**\nIn the heart of Kalgoorlie, where the red earth meets the vast sky, there's a man known simply as Phillip. He's not one for many words, but his actions speak volumes. Every day, before the sun fully rises, Phillip is there with his Orange Sky van, ready to \"smash it out\" as he puts it.\n\"I just start here about sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning, just come and just smash it out,\" Phillip says, his humble words belying the profound impact of his work. \"It's not complicated, you know? Just wash, dry, wash, dry. But for some folks, those clean clothes mean everything.\"\nTo the community, Phillip is more than just the laundry guy. He's a constant, a reliable presence in lives often marked by uncertainty. His Nudju heritage and background working in mines and with Life Without Barriers have given him a unique perspective on the struggles and strengths of the people he serves.\n\"I'm from Norseman, Nudju country,\" he explains. \"Used to work in the mines, then Life Without Barriers. Now I'm here. Different work, same idea - helping people stand tall. Clean clothes help with that, you know?\"\nThe community speaks of Phillip with a warmth reserved for family. They appreciate his quiet efficiency, his non-judgmental presence, and his unwavering commitment. As one community member put it, \"Phillip, he's just there, you know? No fuss, no big talk. But he's there, and that means something.\"\nPhillip's impact goes beyond clean clothes. He's become a thread in the fabric of the community, connecting people through this simple yet essential service. \"I suppose seeing all the family of it, I suppose. The majority of them,\" he reflects. \"They come past, have a yarn, and cruise around somewhere else, another one comes. It's like a circle, you know? Always moving, but always coming back.\"\nThe Orange Sky service, under Phillip's care, has become more than just a laundry stop. It's a gathering place, a checkpoint in people's days where they know they'll find not just clean clothes, but a friendly face and a moment of dignity.\n\"Thirty loads a day, sometimes more,\" Phillip says. \"Each one's a story. Each one's someone feeling a bit more human. It's just laundry, but it's not just laundry. It's... it's giving people back a bit of themselves.\"\nCommunity leaders and service providers speak highly of Phillip's dedication. They note how his consistent presence has built trust, allowing other services to better reach those in need. His work with Orange Sky has become a cornerstone of community support in Kalgoorlie. Phillip himself is modest about his impact. \"I don't talk much, but I listen,\" he says. \"Every load of washing, every conversation - it's all part of the story here. I'm just helping write a few cleaner pages, I guess.\"\nBut to the people of Kalgoorlie, especially those doing it tough, Phillip and his Orange Sky van represent more than clean laundry. They represent care, consistency, and a small but significant restoration of dignity. In a world that can often feel chaotic and uncaring, Phillip stands as a quiet guardian of humanity, one load of laundry at a time.\nAs one community elder put it, \"Phillip doesn't just wash clothes. He washes away a bit of the hardship, a bit of the shame. He might not say much, but his work speaks louder than words ever could.\"\nIn the end, it's perhaps Phillip's own words that best sum up the profound simplicity of his mission: \"Some days are hard. Some people are doing it real tough. But then you see someone walk away standing a bit straighter, looking a bit prouder in their clean clothes. That's why I'm here every day.\"\nAnd that's why, to the people of Kalgoorlie, Phillip isn't just the Orange Sky operator. He's a vital part of their community, a quiet hero whose impact is felt in every clean shirt, every fresh blanket, and every restored sense of self-worth.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "James Dinsdale - Friend - Foothills\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 3: Don't worry about anything else. And then just say your name for me and spell it for me.\n\nSpeaker 4: James Dinsdale. J-A-M-E-S-T-I-N-S-D-A-L-E.\n\nSpeaker 3: Cool.\n\nSpeaker 4: Tell me hail from here.\n\nSpeaker 3: Tell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 4: Nothing much. 72. I live in Fuji, um, unemployed. Uh, own my second house. Got my car, which is good. Um, being to New Zealand, Tasmania, Hong Kong in Norfolk Island, loved them all.\n\nBut that was when I was, before I had my melanoma, which was about five years ago. So stopped me from traveling. So, um, yeah. Can't go overseas anymore. Too much luggage to take with me. If you know what I mean? Yeah. Um, yeah. [00:01:00] Um, and my family name, excuse me, has come from this area.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. We stop. Stop it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. My, ah, something like my family name, the gentleman. You recording or we start?\n\nSpeaker 3: Uh, no, we'll just wait for the lady. I think she wants to for a second. My\n\nSpeaker 4: gentleman that came out from England in the 18 hundreds. He came from England and he came here Gully. And I found out not so long ago that we were in that family line Dinsdale.\n\nSo we got a award and a street name went after us. So, you know, and um, have an orchard back in Baroni or somewhere, you know. So I think they did something to the cancel. I'm not too sure. So, you know, I believe they had a, [00:02:00] I think a timber yard down at, uh, the village down here. Mm-hmm. So corner of Victoria and Station Street.\n\nSo, and an old truck, a Chevy truck, which is down there. Ambleside homestead.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 4: Which I've got a picture of that one. And what's with me in it? What,\n\nSpeaker 3: what's your life like at the moment where you are? Uh,\n\nSpeaker 4: I like it because of the hills.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: The hills. Sounds a bit weird, but the hills remind me of the Grampians, which I love, but it'd just be near the hills.\n\nThat's all.\n\nSpeaker 3: And why do you like coming down here to this service? Why do you like coming to this service and the food and the,\n\nSpeaker 4: just the company. It just, I just use community meals just for socializing. 'cause I live by myself, so, you know. Yeah. Meet people like that lady you just saw then, you know, so, and a few other people.\n\nSo yeah, just come. Because I live by myself. Yeah, sure. So that's about all. Make company, make friends or try you.\n\nSpeaker 3: What do you [00:03:00] like about the Orange Sky Service?\n\nSpeaker 4: Free service. Um, say me doing a bit of washing, but you know, they can clean it and dry it and fold and all you gotta do is just put it away when you get home.\n\nHmm. You know, so I only, I only use 'em once a week and that's about it. The rest of the time I do with washing at home. If the's sun's shining, then it dries 'em out in one day.\n\nSpeaker 3: What do you feel about the sense of community or connection here? What do you think about connecting with other people and the community here?\n\nUh,\n\nSpeaker 4: it's okay. Get on with people. Some people, you know, made a lot of friends. Um, I go to a lot of other meals and. Again, I said to just socializing, but a bit of traveling. Mm. That's the only problem, you know? So, um, we all missed the one on a Sunday going to Mitchum, but, you know, it was too crowded. [00:04:00] Uh, that's another thing I like about, sorry for saying this, not so much this meal, but other meals I went to, like last night at Dubon were open.\n\nYou've got room to move. So when you move your chair, you're not bumping into the chair behind you. You know? So again, it's company people, so you know. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: What's, uh, getting out and\n\nSpeaker 4: about.\n\nSpeaker 3: What, what do you think about, um,\n\nthis idea of struggling? Is that something that you think about much or is it Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: Story for going on? Sorry. But, uh. I got solar. I've had solar for about 12 years. Started off with six panels, and during about 10 years of that 12, I was coping, but now I've got 12 panels and I was making money on 12 panels, and then all of a sudden that got squashed.\n\nYou only get 3 cents rib [00:05:00] kilowatt. You sh put back in the grid. Mm. You get nothing back. Can you turn the camera off? I've got something to tell you. I don't want to, I don't wanna say it wrong. Okay. Um,\n\nSpeaker 3: do you know, do you know much about the, the, the meal stuff here and what, how they do, do you know anything about like the, the, the hall here and the meals?\n\nDo you know how that happens?\n\nSpeaker 4: I've been coming here for quite a few years. I'm about one of the oldest people, people that have been coming here. So I've got to know people that have changed, different people that have changed, but still, you know, still the same people that are serving and all like that is again, it just a community meal free.\n\nAh, it's one of the meals that's closest. The other one, you know, close. 'cause I live in Ali, so this one's close. Yeah. But I don't care. Traveling, you know, it pinch go. 'cause the last place I went to was Linbrook, which is about over half an hour away. You know, that started at a reasonable [00:06:00] time, which was five o'clock.\n\nSo, you know.\n\nSpeaker 3: That's cool. And, and do you know much about the community here? What's the community like in, in like the broader community?\n\nSpeaker 4: Uh, I dunno, actually there's no, no big shops up here. It's just like a little country town, you know? So I don't mind it. Uh, I do hate going to Knox, but, you know, but, uh. I used to like going to Croydon, 'cause Croydon looked like a country village.\n\nUm, then now I'm living out here. It's like a country town. It's still suburbia, you know? So it's got what I want here anyway. Mm. Especially my bank. That'd be critical because I was only the Westpac. Westpac had a branch of Boronia and Mountain Gate. Now I've gotta go to Stud Park. [00:07:00] I had to talk to the lady yesterday.\n\nI said, oh, can you go back to Mountain? Go to a stud park? No, I meant, why? What'd you get rid of the two of them? Instead of just one of them? So I'm about to change banks, which my bank's just down here so easy to go to because Stud Park is so far, uh. Westfield is not that far, but trying to get out because of the parking.\n\nMm-hmm. Immediate, you know, gotta pay to get out, you know, so, but yeah, it's okay. The only other place I go to is Forest Hill, which is where I used to live because the three parking and everything's there. Another thing too, the post office at Knox disappeared at Christmas because the rent Westfield was too high.\n\nSo I've gotta go other, go to Boronia. But then again I go to Forest Hill 'cause everything's at Forest Hill. Oh. Um, stud Park. You go to the post office there and it's too [00:08:00] crowded, which is, you know, but then the one at Knox was big. Yeah. And it got rid of it.\n\nSpeaker 3: Anything else about Orange Sky that you, you wanted to talk about or notice or No.\n\nWhat do you think? Anyway,\n\nSpeaker 4: I got on with the people that run it and of course this is. I've used the Tuesday and I've used the Monday. So it's different people. So, you know, um, I believe there's other that run around everywhere else around me. I haven't been there yet, but I'm happy with what I'm doing here anyway.\n\nSo good to have something for nothing, but then I don't abuse it. I do me washing, own washing at home too, so it's only just, I said once a week. So, um. Mainly what I do here is I do my bed sheets 'cause my machine can't handle it. It's too big. So that's about all. But you know, so\n\nSpeaker 3: good. Cool. Well we're gonna take a little photo, if that's all right.[00:09:00]\n\nYou can tell me about my photo skills,\n\nSpeaker 4: David.\n",

      "Transcript": "Alright, just tell us your name and if you spell it, it'll be amazing because that helps the editor. Okay, so my name's Amanda Mundell. Just look at straight at me. A-M-A-N-D-A, surname M-U-N-D-E-L-L. Tell us a little bit about yourself. I haven't met you yet. I'd love to learn a little bit about you. Who are you? I'm not really sure what to say. If you want me to speak in relation to Orange Sky, I can tell you. You're in relation to yourself initially and you just go from there. So who are you? Tell me a bit about yourself. So I'm a single mum. I raised my two girls on my own. I'm now working as a tenancy manager for Pacific Lynn Cowsing, which is a complete turnaround after everything I've been through. And I help people who used to be in the same situation I used to be in. So that's pretty incredible. What do you come to telling us about your history, I guess? What sort of stuff have you been through? I've been through homelessness, mental health issues, DVI. Child abuse. Yeah, I've been through some pretty dark times. How do you like to talk about that openly? Is there things you like to talk about or not talk about? What are some of the things you would like people to know about you? Some things I'd like people to know? I don't know that you can come out the other side. I think that's the biggest thing. I mean, I got to a point where I completely gave up hope. I didn't think there was... I was on the other side. And now I know there is. That's awesome. What was part of the change? Tell us a little bit about those moments of change for you. I was very lucky. I was approved for an NDIS plan for my mental health. And through all the wraparound supports they provided with psychology, participation in activities with the community and things like that, it really helped me get back on my feet mentally. And then I took a leap of faith when I applied for the cadetship with Pacific Link Housing, studied full time, got my certificate four in housing, and I now have a full time career in an amazing organisation, helping people who used to be in the same situation I was in. Wow, that's incredible. What are some of the things that you remember from when... Do you remember a lot about when you were in the cadetship? Or when you were in the situation when it wasn't nice? And is it okay to...? Yeah, please ask. Yeah, I remember. It was horrible. It's just so sad and lonely. And you have so much guilt for ending up in those situations despite how hard you've tried not to be there. And the impact of the people that sit here and talk to you, I mean, that was huge. Yeah. I mean, I remember when I used to line up here for food, line up here to wash my clothes, and I felt really embarrassed. But he just spoke to me the whole time I was here, and he was so kind and so caring, and he didn't judge me for the situation I was in or what I'd been through or anything I was talking about. And he just had the biggest impact on me. And as soon as I got myself a job and I got myself a house, I thought, I want to give back to the community that gave so much to me. And I became a volunteer for Orange Sky. Wow. Yeah. That's incredible. That's incredible. It's quite unique being able to talk to someone who's been through using the service and now a volunteer. Yeah. What does that feel like for you? It's very humbling. Sometimes it's hard because I know what they're going through, and I can't do more for them while I'm here other than the small amount I'm trying to do. Yeah, I think, but it's also very rewarding. Because I know when they're speaking to me and when they're smiling and, you know, they're just really in the moment and enjoying that moment with me. I know from experience that that has had an impact on them, and they will look forward to coming back next week so they can feel that same way again. That's cool. What was the feeling like even applying to be a volunteer? Like, was that daunting? Was it exciting? Like, how was it for you? Well, I'd never done anything like that before. I was very nervous. I didn't even know if I'd be accepted. I didn't know how it all worked. I just, I so desperately wanted to make people feel how I felt because I don't have the best vocabulary when it comes to describing things, but you really do feel invisible when you're struggling. You know, you don't really have anyone to turn to, anyone to talk to, anyone to help you other than, you know, the specified services. And they try to be as kind as they can, of course, but they can only do so much. The rest of the day and the rest of the night, you're on your own, and you're just stuck up here. And so to just sit here for a whole hour and be treated like I mattered, that meant so much, and that's how I wanted to make other people feel. That's cool. Is this really annoying? I thought that was it. No. It's not like a painful, like, annoying life. Wait, I really thought that was it. I was there. I was, like, maybe dreaming that that was actually there. Actually, this is... Maybe on the other side. Look at that. Oh, my God, that kind of worked. Am I speaking okay? I'm so good. Okay. What is it like as a friend sitting around and getting all, like, talking to all those, I suppose, staff and that kind of stuff? I think once you've been coming here for a little while and you've formed a bit of a relationship, I think that with the Orange Sky staff, it's not as overwhelming, it's not as embarrassing, and you feel a lot more comfortable and a lot more...a lot happier, a lot more open in your conversations. But when people first come here, obviously, they're not sure what's going on or how it works, but it doesn't take long for people to warm up to us. We're all such lovely people, and we all really do have a genuine empathy for everyone we're servicing and everyone we're talking to. And I think they see that and they feel that and they hear that. And they respond to that. That's cool. And then I guess now you're a volunteer. Yeah. Do you feel like you're able to talk to people differently or do you feel like you're the same as any other volunteer? What's that feeling like for you? I think I'm just the same as every other volunteer. We're all just here to, you know, help people and make them feel good and give them, you know, a kind ear and a kind word and some clean clothes. And, yeah, a nice meal from the services that are here. Now that I have the career I have, I sometimes feel like I can help people a little bit more with some advice and some assistance in the way of, you know, how to take a few more steps to get out of the situation they're in. But of course, I try not to do that too often. And I'm not here to tell people what they should do or tell people what I think they need to do. I'm just here to listen and, you know, talk to them. Cool. OK. Um. I don't know if I answered that many questions. I don't want to annoy you too much. No, that's fine. Orange Sky, like, it's laundry, but it's also like a connection space. Yeah. It's also like a genuine conversation. Yep. Are they things more important than the other or is it just dependent on the person that's using the service? A lot of people come for the conversation. Of course, if they need their clothes washed, we're going to wash and dry them for them. But some of the regulars still come even if they don't have any laundry. I think that that connection is huge. Cool. Um. There's a... Like, it's interesting, I guess, like, how would you describe the level of struggle, I guess, the whole community... Is there a general understanding that you have of how much people are struggling in this community or...? On the Central Coast? Massively. Massively. And I think a lot of it is hidden. You know, a lot of people... Because it really does take courage to come here, to have people know your situation, to ask for help. That's hard. It's really hard. I think the majority of people who are struggling hide. So... And then the statistics themselves, I mean, the rate of homelessness, the lack of affordable housing, the lack of rental properties, they're hugely increased. And if you have to pay a priest's rent, it's just making it worse. You know, I think the Central Coast has the highest rate of DV in New South Wales. Drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues. I mean, that system is completely broken. There is no mental health support on the Coast whatsoever. Mm. Yeah, yeah. Do you sometimes think about, like, the levels of disadvantage from a female or male perspective? Are there different, like, risk factors and different things being a female and a male has? Um... I think a lot of people would say yes, because they would think that women are more vulnerable. But I think that's really taking away from how vulnerable men are as well. Yeah. But then you've got the elderly, you know. They're also physically more frail, more prone to illnesses. They don't have the capacity to use technology, which is what's required these days to submit referrals to services or apply for housing and things like that. Um... They also have their medical needs as they get older. But, I mean, the young, the old, the sick, the male, the female, I think we're all just as deserving of the help that we require. Mm. Yeah. I'm just gonna get the help of my mum for a sec. One sec. Take my mum. Yeah, it'd be great. I'm just gonna get the help of my mum for a sec. I'm just gonna get the help of my mum for a sec. I'm just gonna get the help of my mum for a sec. Can you just stand there? It won't be too much long. I'm almost finished. Try not to get the chin hairs. Is that right? I think so. Getting closer, closer, closer, closer. Closer. I'm glad I shaved my face this morning. Is that there? Yeah, that's pretty good. You've got a lovely shine on your face. Oh, thank you. My friend used to say, I look like Burt Newton. A big shiny forehead. Actually, I'm sorry, can you come over this side? I feel like it's a bit better angle. Going closer. Go back a bit. OK. All right. Come around a little bit. Sorry, this is so good. Back a bit. Go forward a bit. I'm just taking a piss now. OK. Um... Stopping you in a minute. What would you say to people that are on the fence about volunteering at Orange Sky and what's the impact that it can have on any type of individual? Yeah, please know that your time is so valuable. I mean, you're only here for one or two hours once a fortnight and the impact that that small amount of time has on the people that come here is huge. Huge. I mean, there are some people who wait all week to come here, just for that day. And you're literally changing people's lives with every conversation, with every load of laundry. You're in a very unique position where you can speak to both groups of people because you've had those experiences. Yeah. Are you comfortable almost, like, what would you say to people who are struggling, who are not wanting to come to Orange Sky, maybe because of different stigma or different people? Like, is there something that you would represent why they should give it a crack? As a friend, you mean? Yeah. So, everyone that volunteers here are so caring, so kind. They genuinely want to see you. They want to talk to you. They want to hear about your day. They want to know what's going on in your life. They want to help you with your laundry to make sure you've got beautiful, warm, clean clothes. And we're here to support anyone in need. So, please don't be scared to come down. You know, we'd really love to see you. Yeah. Um... Just go back a little bit. What was your first time here like, I guess? And were you hesitant in telling... Very, very. Um... Uh... I'd heard about the service. I mean, at the time, I'd just found myself accommodation and I had no washing facilities, so I had to find somewhere to wash my clothes. I heard about Orange Sky. Didn't know what to expect. I came down and saw all these really happy people talking and laughing and sharing a meal and waving each other over and, oh, hi, can we help you? You know, what's your name? Come and have a seat. And I just felt so welcomed. And I thought, wow, I'm gonna come here every week, you know? And I met some really great people and just like I said earlier, the impact the Orange Sky volunteers had on me that day and the way they treated me, it almost brought a tear to my eye of happiness and appreciation. It still sometimes does. Yeah. What is... What's the main difference now that you feel compared to when you were maybe at a lower point? Like, what's the representation that you feel now compared to then? Within myself? Yeah. I feel proud now. I never... Other than doing my best as a single mum, which I was really proud of, and my girls are amazing, so I think that's a testament to what kind of mother I was, as much as I've made mistakes along the way that impacted my family. I never really had anything to be proud of. I never had a sense of purpose. Volunteering and my career now give me that and... I'm not sure what else to say. Yeah. It's incredible. I think it's a really difficult thing to answer and you did such a great job. I mean, my self-worth is through the roof now. I'm certainly... I'm not obnoxious or arrogant, but I've spent my entire life with no self-worth, no self-esteem, completely beaten down, struggling to portray strength to my children. And now I can genuinely feel that strength and feel that pride and feel that self-worth, and that's incredible. What's kind of next, do you think? And in thinking about what's next for you, one thing I'm always very interested in, is there's different types of knowledge in this world. Some knowledge is learnt, some is written and read, and it's a huge part of the experience. So you've had this massive experience. Yeah. How are you going to use that in the next part of your journey? So actually, as of today, I'm not sure if you've heard of the Good Box. Yes, I have. So I'm now going to be a spokesperson for the Good Box, speaking to corporate executives and school children to promote what they're doing and the impact that it has on them. Yes, I have. And I'm just really excited to see what that service has on homeless people. So that's my next step in my charitable direction, because I wish I could do more. I mean, I'm not financially able to do more with my money, but I can definitely do more with my time. I remember when the Good Box started, they came in and they were packing their stuff at Orange Sky. Yeah. It's awesome to see how much... I got a Good Box, you know, and the little handwritten note, just makes a world of difference. little things that are in the box. I mean when you're homeless you can't afford shampoo conditioner and if you do it's the cheapest one possible whereas you get that little box and it's got brand name products in there and it's just like Christmas. Yeah. On that, what's the power of people coming together to do cool stuff? Yeah well I only spoke to them today and it was just amazing so I asked why are you doing what you do and they said just to share awareness and to also share the impact that these sorts of charities have on the people that are benefiting from them and that's what I want to be a part of bringing awareness to people of the impact they can have by volunteering, helping, donating, whatever option they have to give because it hugely impacts people's lives and the smallest thing means so much and I don't think people understand that they think oh I'd have to donate thousands of dollars to change someone's life. Five minutes of your time can change someone's life. How do you think about your next part in terms of being a mother I suppose? What's that identity feel like for you and what do you need to achieve in that life? Oh it's different now. My youngest just moved out so strange that having her at home, my little baby all out there by herself but she's doing really well. My oldest daughter's still at home and she's like my best friend. I don't think, as they become teenagers you kind of think I'd really like to live alone and then they get past that point and they just become these beautiful young adults and you think please don't ever leave. So yeah I just like to continue making my children proud and you know they are really proud of me because they know what I've overcome and I just want to keep doing well in life and show them what can be achieved and be a good role model for them and encourage them to participate and volunteer when they can. Well I'll have to say from you saying you were nervous and not sure what to do. My hands are sweating. My whole body's sweating. You can hide them away. Well we get it. That's it. Like well done. Like it was amazing. Okay thank you. Yeah thanks mum for holding the... Thank you.\n",

      "Transcript": "Daniel O'neill\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAnd I'm moving so much. I'm gonna cut my hands. Yes. I'm getting better at, clap my hands. It's quite hard when you want a good clap, right? All right, so as look at me, I'll get my eye line close enough. I think it's always a drama. This eye line thing. Uh.\n\nAll right brother, so all we need to do is just tell me, uh,\n\nso just let me know your full name, Daniel O'Neill.\n\nSo it's D-A-N-I-E-L? Yep. And then o, o apostrophe, N-E-I-L-L. [00:01:00] Cool. Uh, do you prefer email or um, phone for sending this to you? Phone's fine. Yeah. What's your number? 0 4 3 9 6 5 3 4 6 3.\n\nAnd we are at the, which shift are we at? Oh, good. I'll be able to tell you in two seconds. Is it Communities at Work? Yep. Cool.\n\nHi, rose. What's, um, tell me a bit of the Daniel story for a second. Uh, where do you want me to start? It's up to you, brother. What, how do you like introducing yourself and talking about yourself? [00:02:00] Um, well, I'm a country Victorian boy. Um, born and bred in the sort of the Mali area of Victoria. Um, went to primary school, high school there, and then after that moved away for about a year or so.\n\nAnd then after that I joined the military when I was 19. So I was then, uh, posted to Darwin. I then, uh, done some more training while I was up there. Uh, also while I was there, I had the, uh, the privilege of deploying to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once, which is a big eyeopener. And, uh, just in terms of like the way people live and work and breathe, it's a completely different.\n\nSort of environment, um, takes a bit getting used to and also takes a bit getting used to coming home as well. Um, [00:03:00] yeah, I've had my struggles of mental health and stuff like that, so that's why I sort of reached out to Orange Sky to, um, come here as a volunteer. Um, I was lucky enough to start about 80 months ago here at Orange Sky.\n\nUm, I did about six months. Here with the communities at work. And then I was then also given the privilege of being a, an active assistant team leader. So that was another big eyeopener, like managing people in the volunteer space. Um, 'cause you can't really tell people what to do. You just ask, I suppose.\n\nUm, and yeah, here I am being dragged in from the streets to, uh, help out with this shift. Um. Yeah. Cool. What, um, what was the first sort of interaction with orange fire? What, what'd that feel like? Uh, what sort of stood out to you? I guess? Uh, I always [00:04:00] like giving, uh, instead of like receiving like at Christmas time and stuff, I would prefer to give 10 presents and receive one.\n\nWhereas if the other way around, uh, it doesn't sit well with me, so. Yeah, I completely forgot what you asked me. No. Yeah. What was the first time you saw her? Yeah, basically just social media. Um, and I think I seen the van once or twice around town and just interested to see what it is. Um, yeah, about 18 months ago, joined the crew here.\n\nUm, my previous employment allowed me to come here like every second week, but now I've sort of moved on to a new job, which is nine to five. Um. I've got today off and they were short a person, so thought, pulling the boots and give it a crack. That's cool. Um, how do you relate to your own experience when you're talking to people that are coming and using the band?\n\n[00:05:00] Is that something you think about or you try and turn that off? What's your process? Uh, not so much turn it off, just sort of turn a filter on, I suppose, and just listen. Without judgment is the biggest thing. Um, I was a very judgmental person probably up to about five years ago, but yeah, ever since I've been here, it's completely flipped around.\n\nUm, yeah, I, I love it here. Why do you think that's flipped you? Like what was the things that maybe, um, caused the change or was it, was it a bunch of things or was it like, uh. Whenever I go to like a big count, uh, like a big city and stuff, and you see homeless people everywhere and like begging for money and stuff and I'm just like, there's gotta be an easier way to actually deal with this.\n\nSo that's why I volunteer here. I also donate to Orange Sky every month as well. Um, and sort of, I wouldn't say it gives you like a warm and fuzzy feeling, but you just know that you're [00:06:00] helping. In it being here on shift or donating money so it can then go and help for the future, I suppose. Um, yeah, I'm always interested in like, so much some of the things to donate to.\n\nMm. What's the, what's the theory behind Lawrence Sky versus something else? Uh, I know where the money's going and I have seen change, um, even the short period that I've actually been here and the short period that I've been donating as well. Um, and yeah, you can sort of see where your money's going. I, uh, yeah, I think, yeah.\n\nThat's cool. Um, what's this like feeling of conversations around the day and is it something that's forced and you need to do it or is it natural or how's that feeling? Uh, it sort of comes natural, I suppose. And just going back to the point of being, uh, non-judgmental, just listen without judgment and.[00:07:00] \n\nSometimes I can relate to the stories and actually then give my own experiences. Um, but yeah, but the biggest thing is just listen. Um, there's people around the town and around the city that have pretty much got no one to talk to. Um, so the only time that they might talk to people is when they come here.\n\nUm, or different settings like this, I suppose. That's cool. Um, so you don't have. Great job. I, there's this thing we call keys to the city. Sorry, there's something, good keys to the city. Never heard of it. It's, um, just a way for me to say, is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you've always wanted to talk about or elements of already inspired that we haven't touched on or, yeah.\n\nThe biggest thing in this job is the homelessness and just understanding like where people have come from and, um. And they're only here for say, [00:08:00] maybe five minutes when they drop off their washing, it's a five minute chat. And when they come and pick it up, if they wanna chat for five minutes or five hours, we're here to do it.\n\nSo, yeah. Um, and in terms of, yeah, I, I don't really have much to add. Sorry. It's amazing. Um, we might be able to talk to one Jasmine. Jasmine, do you much about Jasmine and her? Yeah. Oh, do you, do you know much about her though? Not, uh, not really. I know that she loves coming here for a chat. She's a big, big chatter, which is, and she just brings in a, like completely different vibe.\n\nBut when she turns out, um, yeah, she sort of brings a bit of energy to the room, as you say. But yeah, she'll be good for a chat. How long has she been comfortable? Uh, as long as I've been here. 18 months? Yeah. At least. Wow. Yeah. I couldn't tell you how long, but. I'm sure she'll tell you that. So, yeah. Alright, Brad, we're gonna take a big [00:09:00] photo.\n\n",

And so, and we worked out that his family had been here twice or whatever. And then he says this throwaway, he says, oh, and I picked it up. He says, oh, yeah, it'd be good to do something in that range of space. I said, I'll be very careful of what you say till I tell that, because I've heard that. And I'm like, yeah. And so, yeah, we'll do this loop where, because I actually said to him, I said, oh, I've got a very specific need for our training education center, which I have been bang on forever and a day. And it's the space between curriculum development between the school and the university and how do we transition that. And I told him about this program that we did in Ipswich. And I needed someone who was good with curriculum who could translate the needs, social needs of disengaged young people in community and to give them a pathway, but also to help teachers then find a path, help them to transition. And part of that transition was better English skills, better math skills, but to get into the space where they're ticking the boxes for the certain different subjects for those choices. And it's not only about stepping stones and a pathway for the students, but stepping stones and pathways for the teachers so that everything had synergy, because the employers, the teachers needed to know that outcome on a certain topic. It was just brilliant. You know, and Cass Grant, I remember talking about this girl, Crass Grant, and she was the one that was able to stitch it together. So I didn't have those skills. And I said, now I'm talking to James Cook University about this training education space. And I haven't got those skills. So I need someone, you know, to connect the space. So he had a deep connection, deep need for his connection to Palm. And I had this deep need for that particular role. Yeah. So, so one of the things is that, you know, I said the same thing back to Nick, you know, this messiness of a website design. And he goes, oh, you know, Ben can help with that one. And I said, oh, be careful what you say. I'm sorry. And then I just said to Nick later, I said, as it is, we had dollars assigned, one for website development, for PR, but also, I kid you not, for drone support. I kid you not, seriously. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. And he went, yeah, absolutely. So even country knows my deep need before even bloody knowing. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So one thing that I do say, how do you feel? Yep. Before we keep going, I'm just going to move this a little bit, just because, look. How are you feeling? Just before you dig into that. Oh, this is awesome, Rich. Yeah. Good spot. Okay, Bryce. Yeah. I'm feeling affirmed, because those principles of country shall provide has come to fruition, even though it's only Wednesday. I was just going, wow, tick, tick, tick, boom. And the other one is, in terms of country survive, is that, you know, I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. Yeah. And I think it's a good thing. And now it's just gone. Country shall provide. But yeah, it is about identifying beyond everything else, you know, what is, yeah. Not to have that bandage solution, but what is that dignity, what is that dignity? That's cool, Bryce. Probably a whole lot. Yeah. Yeah. firm's much trajectory of the training education center building people's capacity that's the real people yeah how um like since since i've got here last three days um like it's been super interesting to me just to see over 10 years i don't know how much visibly has changed on palm island like there's been new buildings and stuff like that um but um i see those young fellas working for you it was interesting for me like coming here so many times not being able to do ceremony not being able to be welcomed correctly that kind of stuff um maybe we can sort of start there and think about like from from what we did this morning how does that sort of relate to like having a place to welcome people and also building for the future maybe like how does that how does that idea around having people like us come partner and try to um build stuff together and everything linking that with ceremony and story and song yeah um so um walter palm island the second um would say to me i remember saying to and he's our senior um law man said um oh man what's this all about what's what's what is this all about um and we're talking this in the context of the resource management plan everything that we're doing how around complex ideas about vision and where we wanted to go the mumbran on the move document and um he summed it up in one word acknowledgement you know and so he just he just wanted our people to be acknowledged as the rightful custodians of this land that's known as palm island you know yeah and we ended playing justанные i don't know if that was told that time but that's when we were asked to arrive and like so he said i think that there was a couple pieces to that um story and so i was never bothered to fees um to örde i didn't feel um just sometimes yeah i don't know how much theawl um um is was um sort of more of like a quote-with-word thing um and yeah and and and that that was no guess um Australian or by the international called FPIC, free and prior informed consent. And yeah, I guess we doubled down on different organisations to say don't bring your programs, we've set the table and we've set a place for you to sit at. You're invited to the table, but it's going to be also on our invitation. And so that's been really interesting. And some people have responded and respectfully said, oh, okay. And some people have continued to do the same thing of not acknowledging and ignoring protocol and coming on country without prior consent. Yeah. And that's been a concern and trading on that basis. So, yeah, we recognise that there's still a battle to be won. But Walter Palm Island would also say beyond the principle of acknowledgement, he would say, is that a principle of? Principles before personalities. Meaning, you know, people will come and say and be, you know, puff their chest out about what they can do and can't do and whatever and promise you the will. But we've got to adhere to our principles. And if we adhere to the principles, then we're going to be able to do what we want. And when he says the principle to, you know, it's principles embedded in law and enshrined within the country. One of those key ones has been that for every newcomer that comes, let's be respectful and do that welcome to country. But we invite people into the story. And we've been able to. Yeah, it was remiss of me to have Nick not taken Nick up the mountain, not taken you up the mountain, to not have done the story to welcome. And so and then. To be able to afford that to Max, he was so pumped and just blown away. Oh, wow. This this is really cool. So to have those younger men. Now become comfortable for Uncle Al to be comfortable with speaking language and to do that language well for young water to stand tall and do that presentation, not only in the ceremony, but also in the school. Yeah, it just warms my heart that these young men and my elders are finding their rightful place again. So that's a beautiful thing. So like all I see at the moment, especially the last few days is talk around building, but I also hear it place. Yeah. That's the one thing of still learning. But understanding the need for having something that is built in this place that provides capacity and builds for the future. What's like the maybe if you start with the like the end game as to what what you're working to achieve and have a bit of a yarn about like maybe the why you're doing it, but also the why you're doing it. And so what do you think? What do you think you're going to what are the steps to get there maybe over the next little while? Yeah, well, the building, you know, we talked about the training education. Yeah, exactly. That's it's a building. But it's it's not really the building for so but it's a gathering place where like-minded people which around just certain skills can have a have a place to really be a part of the building and it's a place where we can have a conversation and have a conversation about the building. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. And I think it's a really important thing. And I think it's a really important thing. It's a really important thing. We have to have a place that is designated to teach. It's a very technical, clever fireplace. We gather around fire. We gather around fireplaces to learn, learn story, to learn knowledge, to gain knowledge, to be equipped, to be empowered. Yeah. And I think that's what we're trying to do. And I think that's what we're trying to do. Nowadays, though, I mentioned people call that a classroom, you know, and so we get to gather in those classroom spaces now. And but those are places that are those gathering places that they're to. With children. Whether they're going back school and going to the school for courses, they're going to go into one or two courses a day. They go to one or two boarders and get on one of those high and call boarders. So i meet these people to get children on balance into. You know where they go and that's where I need to get in this Maoando gap. They've got or you know, I'm incredibly lucky to be a man, what I'm saying, my就可以 approach. So really it happens. But then I've got one side of this. One thing is Forference. Really other ones have, you know, walking on and it's pretty easy. They do. I've got families and there're a lot of families in the world that can get together with a reason. You know, they have a long service line. of life and live off country. Yeah. But if you don't have that ability to, and you cannot hunt and gather without that knowledge. And so you've got to gather around the fireplace. That's a principle, you know. If you're not gathering around the fireplace, sitting with the elders or the knowledge elders, you miss out. You absolutely miss out. And then, invariably what will happen is that you'll either get very hungry or you'll become dependent upon someone else to go out and hunt and gather for you. And for a man, you know, that's problematic because the spirit man can't be strong. Yeah. And you'll feel flawed and shallow. Yeah. So that's a no good place for us, you know. And we only have to look at, you know, the rights of suicide and young men and especially, yeah, Aboriginal men. And it's a no good thing when their spirit is no good. But your spirit, if you know you're, if you have a sense of, of your place and your space and, or your role and your function, you might not know the fullness of what it is to be a, you know, to hunt and gather uncertain. But you'll have a crack. You'll have a crack. You'll have to have an absolute crack, you know. And sometimes you'll get it and sometimes you won't. Yeah. But, you know, the beautiful thing about spaces where you're coming back to having those places of learning or whether it's the fireplace or the classroom is that you get the ability to hone your skills and sit with knowledge holders and become a little bit more of an effective hunter-gatherer, if that makes any sense. And where you went wrong, you can come back to someone and go, ah. And you tell the story about where you went wrong and you can improve on it. Yeah. And so, yeah, or should be showing a way to do it more effectively or better. One thing we definitely talked about last three days is lots of ideas. Innovation, I guess, is a word that we use for some of it, but also just like problem solving, lots of things. What's, I guess, what's some of the ways you sort of are tackling that or working on that when there's a hundred things to do and a hundred ideas and, you know, you're just trying to get it going. We certainly do. Sometimes we keep thinking of things that we have a slightly bigger project than we have the entire time, you know, and then from saying, okay, we can share that in a variety of ways. You have just told us how life is very different in your job journey that didn't seem like a он means reality, that it's a little bit different for you, but you carry it on. An, yeah. I kinda discovered that I never got into the story of me coming back to America on Costa Rica and traveling, things like that. And so. I mean, yeah. No. But. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, very independent and very much would run ahead and just get it done. You know, almost climb the mountain and go. He's watching, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, probably for the last 18 months to two years, I've been banging on with my team and going, OK, I need you to shine because if you shine, I'll look good. And I do, I'll say to them, come on, I need you to shine, make me look good. And that's been, yeah, that's been part of the journey. But in order for them to shine, they need a whole bunch of things like encouragement and to be able to be listened to and to know where they're coming from. And I've got, I've had to leave my office and walk a little bit over the way towards my workers. Yeah. And to see where they were at. And yeah, and so that's been, that's been good. So rather than do, now we do this thing where instead of me having to walk, I'd gather them and so we'd have team meetings and every morning and we'd have PD and we have all of those things that we other groups that see in the workplace and maybe take for granted, but our guys gather and feed off it and they go, oh, wow. Yeah. And it's and now the beautiful thing is they take the workshops and they run the meetings and they do some of the think tanks. or they'll share what they learned or what happened last week and what have you. And I get the bugger off and sit in the office and find money. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's been really good that we're all bang on about empowerment and, yeah, that we model that and we've tested it and we've seen that it actually works. And even when people, though, fall off and feel like they can't rise to the occasion, how many guys have walked away and said, oh, it's all too hard, and then they've circled back and came and went, oh, Rich. It's all right, I've come back. I'll go, yeah, brother, come on. Yeah. Yeah. Is there, I don't know if you think about these words much at all, but we're doing a lot of systems thinking type stuff at the moment and there's a simpler idea with it, I think, which is how is everyone lifting each other up across all of the areas and how are we sharing that, whether it's in community or outside of community? What's some of the ways you're envisaging that and whether it's how do you, like, show what you're doing to community, but also that next layer of, like, how do you show the world, maybe, what's happening in Palm Island, I guess? And is that even something you're thinking about at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No. Sometimes. When you're in the, what, in the cowfish, yeah, it's really hard to look up because you get the dust in your eyes and you, yeah, and you get the dust in your lungs and it's hard to breathe and, yeah. But then you get some sound bites and some of those sound bites are from people in the community or an uncle and they go, oh, yeah, I really well like what you're doing, you know. Or you get a phone call. And, you know, got a phone call from an elder who said, oh, someone saw me in community, you know. Heard about what, yeah, told me about what's going on. And there was a time in which sometimes you just shy away from that encouragement. You go, ah, you know, damn it. Now I go, oh, gosh, that's a goal. I absolutely needed to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. But with every, but for every good moment, there's probably 10, 15, 20 not so good moments. And so, yeah, you do get, you get weathered and tired. Yeah. And that being said, the whole team gets weathered and tired. And so we're very conscious of the fact that in this particular space, the weight of expectation, however unfounded or undeserved, you know, for a very young group, there's, yeah, there's a heavy weight of expectation on the ranger program. Yeah. And the good thing that we found is I've said to the team, okay, boats left the harbour. Let's just keep pushing forward. Some of the people that you get in the negative stuff, they'll fall in the wake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there were some people who go, oh, damn, they're going to paddle really hard, catch up and say, hey, can we jump on board? Let's not wait for people. Let's just keep pushing on. And then let's not go too fast. Just set a steady pace. Because we want those people to catch up. So true. What's, this is a more direct question. I don't really do these direct questions very much. What do you hope that people, like if someone saw the Ranger program and didn't know what it was, what would you hope that they would think, I guess? Like if, say, we were able to see a video or see a story, what would you hope that that story presented and what would you hope that they sort of feel about what you're trying to do? Like maybe they see a few piggies of what happened this morning at the ceremony and it's like, is there a message you would hope that... Yeah. We're in a season right now, I think, of, yeah, leadership development. And I would, yeah, just elements of people just growing in confidence. Yeah. Yeah. I think... Yeah. I mean, we can, you know, we can show a beach clean up with, I don't know, 40, 50, 60 kilos of rubbish. We can do these things where we're doing cultural burns and seeing good grass come back or, you know, and we can have those physical signs of the ecology. But I would hope that if we look at the history of power, if we look at the history of the American people, and the weight of years where people didn't have a lot of... Elders didn't have a lot of, you know, what I call, didn't have a lot of voice, didn't have a lot of choice. That to then see a small remnant of their descendants rising out of the dust. of that history and just owning a space of semi-independence and autonomy and with a space of creativity and purpose and with fire and energy, then you're going to go, oh, yeah, there's something different about this little team. And I'm hoping that little team will actually then grow into a bigger team and be able to almost produce a wave or a movement of change for this place. Yeah. Yeah. I could almost taste it every now and then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially in some of the eyes of these lads when they, you know, they jump in the ute and they're gone. You go, yeah, okay. But they come back and they're sweating and they're talking about what they've done and how excited and you just go, oh, yeah, that's good. So cool, man. Yeah. So we hit half hour, so maybe we can do a couple more questions and wrap it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think one thing I was thinking about is this bridge metaphor where you have traditional knowledge and then you have like modern day activities that are happening. Like what's, what do you think, do you think the young followers of the bridge, do you think like people coming into the bridge and like how do you see that being successful, bridging cultural knowledge with like what's happening today and like the one thing I always think about is it's almost like the opposite which is like how are we creating a way for the people that are moving too fast in wrong ways to slow down and listen to the, you know, to the indigenous cultural historical knowledge and yeah. I suppose you had two questions. Do you think that's happening on Palm or not and how do you think we maybe do that better, like using that stuff? Yeah, obviously, not obviously, since you're the one obviously, because it's obvious some, it's not obvious for others. But there's, I'll start with this. For some of it, for some people, they were doing people and I think I've talked about that. What do you do earlier as a vocation and what, what happened and, and they get their identity out of what they do. For others, it's where, when I call our small, we're being people, we be, to sit and to be to, and, and it's, it's about occupying a place or a space in relationship to family or to country and so I say we're being people. This is, this is why my job is to be a person. Yeah. Our whole life is about socializing and being a person. Not talking about thekg that we have to battle because it's like, or, you know, we shouldn't come from one night to, or, like, one hey people arrive, they cross together, yeah. we should come from measuring up so that we don't go anywhere in a long time. And the, they're, they're, you know, another layer on, a nutshell, is, is what you do. It's about building on this. You know. Well, to... If you haven't got a job or something like that, and you're unemployed, straight away you're on the left foot. And you go, well, I might be unemployed. And that takes away from who you might be. And so we've got, you know, very much high unemployment in this place. Yeah. What was the question? How do we bridge cultural? Yeah. So one of the things is, for me, is how do we go from a place of brokenness where it's really hard to find who you might be because you've been displaced, you know, to a place where you are who you are. And you know who you might be. And then you participate in that place, what you're doing. And yeah. And so if I come from an angle of the expectation of the mainstream, of come on, guys, we need to go and do things. Oh, they'll go. They'll get the same reaction. They'll just push back at me and go, no, he's barking orders like boss. So what we flip that to say, well, the range of program or member operations is like the tip of the spear. This is what we do. But it's also at the same time who we might be. And on one side, we are informed by our law. We understand ourselves as Aboriginal people. But then and even the brokenness of that, if that makes any sense. So our law has been, you know, but we have a sense of identity in that. And then our LAW, whatever our obligations under the mainstream law, that's the other side of the spear. And we're not going to say, well, let's throw that one away. Let's throw this one away. But we're going to actually use each to inform the operation of what we do. And that'll sharpen our spear. And some of the things we'll use and some things we'll drop off. Even in our law, we might drop off something. As an example, I had one of my workers would say, I have a cultural obligation to go to do sorry business. But I'm going to let that drop off in order for me to be more effective, more present in my work. Now, that's a huge call. It's an absolute huge call. But he said, oh, he is valuing that. We need the vote to push forward. And it's just amazing. Under the law side of things, there are some things in terms of policy and that kind of stuff that we have to ensure. HR and we've got to tick all of those sorts of boxes, you know. But the other side of the coin is we're not going to bow down to every government official or whatever he says and comes knocking on our door and saying, oh, I'm the minister. You know. So, yeah, we might let that drop off and go, oh, very nice to meet you. But, yeah, okay, it's nice to be informed, you know. So there is a sense in which – so I had an old – an elder, Uncle Graham, he would say about both sides of those coins. We've got to work out there's two ways. We need to work out. What we need to adopt, whether it's in law or LAW or LRA, what we need to adapt. So, oh, that's a good thing, but, you know, it might shape it a little bit. And what we might need to abandon, you know. And I go, hmm, well, to let go, you know, for the sake of moving some things forward. So, yeah. And that's how we held the tension of the bridge. Not to build a bridge, but to use each worldview to sharpen our sort of past spirit. That's wicked, eh? We could stop there, bros, or is there another – anything else? Yeah. Oh.\n",

You don't have to worry about this thing.\n\nSpeaker 18: Yeah. So my name\n\nis Nilson Naoje\n\nand, um,\n\nSpeaker 17: how do you spell it?\n\nSpeaker 18: Uh, so N-I-L-S-O-N and last name is NA uh, JE.\n\nSpeaker 17: Awesome. Tell us, tell us a little bit about yourself.\n\nWhere do you, where are you staying at the moment? Um,\n\nSpeaker 18: I'm staying in Victoria, uh, Victoria, Melbourne in Danina. Um, stay here for 19 years, uh, with my parents, uh, mom and um, sibling. And I got a younger brother and the younger sister. I'm the oldest and, um, yeah, living happier and, um. I ma migrate from Africa, 20, uh, 20 years, 19, [00:01:00] uh, so roughly, uh, 19 years.\n\nSo, um, Dan, a good place for, you know, a community that can, you know, your country, your place, and starting a new future. For us as, uh, we don't have, uh, all the parents, but before us for, um, million years or a hundred years, we are not indigenous Australians. Uh, we just come from a long way to reach to a peace place and happier place.\n\nAnd to start something within ourself is just, uh, where we come from. And we need to start something and we have to start something. Um, and the world is going, [00:02:00] uh, financially, uh, hard to live in a nice and peace and happier life and learn, trying to educate ourself and um, just to be wise. 'cause the world is getting, um.\n\nNot knowing about the world really enough until we, uh, I start something to, uh, to be, um, just part of, um, any country or country ourself as young fellows or young youth or African, uh, just any community can believe on educations so. Dealing with, um, life or liars that you could be something but you choosing a different direction.\n\nAnd it is the only one direction of succeed is to, to study something and to have a goal, and to have a mind [00:03:00] line, uh, that can, uh, learn to, to make a better place.\n\nSpeaker 17: What's, what's some of the things that have been a bit tough for you recently? Like what are some of the toughest things for you?\n\nSpeaker 18: Uh, it is something that, um, you, coming from beliefs, most of the times it's your belief is, um, not focusing about your belief and your mind or your heart is, and different and something, and something unbelievable.\n\nSo it is more like you don't believe. Things will come quicker, uh, or things can have a time or thing. You can, um, want something, but you have to do sort of things to own it. If you need to buy something, you have to save because you don't have money and you don't have money, but you, you know, where's the money and why [00:04:00] you need the money.\n\nWhy so something that in gold, in plan. That you have to plan your mind into that something that you need. So it's all for me, it's patience and certain and have maybe a wi wisely, uh, to educate yourself. It is just not, you're not running to owning money. You are not running to, in a way that, um. You will have maybe in short times, cars and houses in that will be dodgy for your own mind because mine is all about study and, and have, have yourself in timing doing anything inside of things.\n\nAnd Yeah, and I think [00:05:00] sometime is the difficulty of getting to, uh, different people that you don't know and you're trying to introduce yourself with, um, just with your heart. 'cause you dunno mm. The mining is tell you is people that you don't know is sometimes good for you, bad for you, but this choice to why you need the set of people that be with you.\n\nAnd you have to choose carefully. And some of them, some of them, um, will be, uh, bad for you or some of them will be good for you and you don't have a way of, um, to have another way of, have them through you or through what you're going through, and you cannot force anybody. That to be in your problems and to be part of your problems.\n\nAnd you see there was, you will not see. [00:06:00] They'll try, you try to give them a story about your life and how your misery or how your suffering or your need of support, and you cannot force them for that. They need you need from you is to have a nice story sitting down and see what you need to do with your own self.\n\nWith your own life, and then consider that as professional worker to help you and give that with you and take, uh, to a better way of understanding why things will happen when you're not knowing anything. And,\n\nSpeaker 19: hey, breath, bad. Uh, Freddy. My name Freddy. Freddy. Ben, lovely to meet you. Oh, Ben, nice to meet you.\n\nYeah, lovely to meet you. I'm from you. It's good. Yeah. I just have to go to the library. Just have a quick shower and come back.\n\nSpeaker 18: God bless you. To\n\nSpeaker 19: get my, get my clothes.\n\nSpeaker 18: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 19: Thank you very much. Don't be late. Yeah, yeah. I just, you know, walk, [00:07:00] take my time. Okay. They said if Freddy as\n\nSpeaker 17: well. Yeah. If you got time to talk to me later after your library.\n\nSpeaker 19: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Awesome. I just get, uh, I just have a quick shower. Great. Because I feel itchy. Amazing. Do it.\n\nSpeaker 17: Amazing. Good to catch up.\n\nSpeaker 19: Yeah. Thank you,\n\nSpeaker 17: Ben. Thank you, brother. Thank you. See, you.\n\nSpeaker 19: See.\n\nSpeaker 17: So why, why, why are you using orange sky at the moment? What's\n\nSpeaker 18: Well, um, dealing with other things at home. So I don't have a new one.\n\nI don't have, uh, uh, the old one's not working, so. That, um, I'm dealing with sampling homeless and not having, um, a right place from place to place. And so surviving, and that's what I learned this, um, not quite well knowing how to survive that, but surviving in different places. It could be different as surviving in other communities or other cities or other suburbs.\n\n[00:08:00] Mm-hmm. It is way to get some help.\n\nSpeaker 17: Mm.\n\nSpeaker 18: And way to, um, so you organize, organize yourself and to get sort of take like professional places so you can just know what way you're seeking for what you need. And I think there's no, uh, wrong, uh, right until you find with the mistake first. And if you make a mistake, there's no problem.\n\nAnd, uh, that's what my way of seeing. Mm-hmm. It's not wrong thing to make a mistake if you don't know.\n\nSpeaker 17: Mm-hmm. And what do you think of service?\n\nSpeaker 18: Oh, they're helping a lot, you know, support, that kind of support is very nice, you know, because, um, you dunno how to get around where your financials bad after you don't have a work and you don't have a place to stay and.\n\nYou. You don't have a friend around you and you do try maybe [00:09:00] everything and you're still in the same situations and you going back forward. To bring a future from what? In the past, if you lost the, if you lose your way of the past is, and it's all about histories and you know, what\n\nSpeaker 17: sort of conversations do you have with the volunteers?\n\nSpeaker 18: Uh, everything, everything sometime is you get a fox, uh, a fox, the, the news around and if you social all the time around. And you just knew what she going through. And sometimes it doesn't have to be, um, face to face or man to man or something that I really want people share. He, well, he all this news around all this gathering and having talk about that and they talking about.\n\nUm, who or [00:10:00] who say it and all of that. They want to say about things and they really want to think about things. They wanna like someone or don't like someone, or they hate someone, or don't hate all this other thing. Sometime you choose your way. Uh, choose way only is unique, is to see. The most important is your mind.\n\nKeep going and think, but if you choose it. Uh, to get off after it and relax your mind and start just, you know, focusing by yourself. And that would be, I think, perfect, but after just people will have to share small things just to be, you know, shelter, just open and, uh, but what heard you, what you don't succeed things or you don't, you are dealing with other financial stuff, problem or families or all of that, sometimes.\n\nHmm. That's the mind. Always bring.\n\nSpeaker 17: And why, why do you think it's important to have other people to have conversations with and talk to? [00:11:00]\n\nSpeaker 18: It is very important. It's part of, uh, human nature and part of your parents that if you go through parents, you go mom and dad, you go through school, you going through, if you did go through all of that, if you go through, um.\n\nUh, a belief. You have a belief through a church or through, um, any belief in this world, you need someone to talk to. And it's just that if you really need, uh, some help, you need someone to talk to. You need anything in this world is somebody, uh, have to have a word with you. If, if, even though, yeah, social yourself.\n\nOr you'll take yourself out of the community, out of your families. You say you wanna be with yourself, only you working hard for yourself, but end of the day you have to come out again and tell them why and why you have to be with [00:12:00] yourself all the times. What's the mistake or anything particular that he, why you don't want to be with everybody, but yeah, because.\n\nYou trying to see the mistake that you always bring, or maybe the happy, well, the happier, the happier time by yourself even have to have a reason. And maybe you're trying to take some, uh, other point that yourself, it's the soul and the heart and the mind that you have is belong to God. And. And that time is people have like, just like your mother.\n\nMm-hmm. And just like your father and your nephew and brother, they have something with you. Yeah. And part of you,\n\nSpeaker 17: why do you think some people are disconnected?\n\nSpeaker 18: So they're disconnected because self shame or self [00:13:00] wisely to be, um, um,\n\nuh. It could be part of a succeed work for yourself. It could be you give time outside the box or outside the circle once when, when you need to be working for yourself. When you need to work for yourself. It mean that you need to show, show you need to be yourself. And work hard was, was, um, was the be, uh, benefit.\n\nThat you want to bring for others or for yourself. Yeah. And work hard for it. So most of the times is that you had to come back to yourself. Mm-hmm. And after when you find you wrong or right, uh, you make a mistake. Yeah. Make sure you're always sorry. And, and that's human leads, you know that. [00:14:00] You gotta come back to, um, to a way that we have to talk to each other and be great to each other, and be nice to each other and start working hard to a way that we all support each other with different, uh, different stages of learning or different specialties.\n\nUh, just, you know, in that. Uh, type of rough times and we had to work together and any type of professional works so we all can support each other and reach to a happier place with the old be, uh, universe and the old community and the countries and, and the cities and the place that, um, hard place to be around tough places.\n\nAnd, uh. And people are not getting enough support. Mm-hmm. They don't know how to reach to a higher place that you can say, okay, I'm going dealing with this and I [00:15:00] cannot support. I've been five years, six years, 10 years. I can't reach even to, um, a medical support. Yeah. And, uh, you know, nobody can help me and I'm giving up.\n\nAnd I think the, I think the, this life is nothing. So when the support is here, it's just that people not working together and bring, bring blessing to the whole nation, you see.\n\nSpeaker 17: And what would you say to Orange Sky people about what they do? Like if you talk to the Orange Sky volunteers or the people?\n\nSpeaker 18: Well, they, they want to know the, the really story that what people going through. I think, I think it's a better idea because that's the way that this is, this Australia is a very nice place, you know, because you want to know if it is, is the true, what is you going through, you know, in the true way of seeing what we, uh, the first place that what we doing with our people, you know?\n\nSo we get to know that the support is here [00:16:00] and whatever you need it and miracle support is here. Anything that you need is here. It's just way you are looking for yourself. What, what is it? What is going, what are you going through? You know, it is through way of life, you see, and then we're all going through different struggle.\n\nIt's not just because Australia or it's not just because, uh, America. It is not just because you are in a country of, uh, Africa. You dunno how to get some help and all of that. And, um, I think it's just that, um, telling you have to tell the truth about really what you're going through. It could be easy, uh, easy access to get your support and happier after you have many, uh, different idea about.\n\nOther things and easy to dealing with type of people coming from many place around the [00:17:00] world. And if you ask me, I'm from here, and you ask them and you bring them together and they have different word. And how, where they going struggle, what, how they're gonna struggle. Where you get, what's the problem, what's the problem?\n\nIf they find them similar way they have, they operate in the same mind of suffering, or you find, uh, operate in a way that they don't have enough, they get less, uh, um, not treat them well. Um, not respect for them because they don't have anything. Uh, or just because, um, they don't know anything. So maybe people, um, different from different nationalities and different belief and, and that's easy.\n\nCan we, I think it's easy. Can walk back easy in, in a different communities and in different professional work, I think. I think that's not hard. That's cool. Yeah. To communicate. Again, we're all [00:18:00] helping. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 17: 20 minutes. Well done. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 18: Thank you.\n",

      "Transcript": "# Paul and Tig\n[00:00:00]\nNo, I was here on Monday. Here on Monday. Oh, okay. So probably all Canberra ones. Yeah. Okay. We ready? Yes. Paul Super Cash. First of all, foremost, your full name and spell it for me. Yep. My name is Tig Hall, T-I-G-H-A-L-L. Cool. And Paul Miller. P-A-U-L-M-I-L-L-E-R.\nI am the queen being clown, I suppose. I work for CDC Transport, which is working with disabled kids, taking 'em to and from school, and I hang around here when I'm not at work, you know. I joined Orange Sky about eight years ago, I think.\nHad been a public servant and now happily retired. So I spend my Wednesdays hanging out with Paul and all our friends. I think I just came here one day. And the van was here, or was it? No, down at We were down in town. Yeah. And they had that, 'cause that's when the first one that had the showers and.\nThere was lunch available? Yeah, so it's that partnering with an [00:01:00] organization which offers additional services. So we, we would meet people while they would go in and have lunch, and now we meet people while they go in and have breakfast. So it gets even better. Yeah. Annie's doesn't mean breakfast doesn't.\nNo, don't they? Yes. They, Annie's has nice breakfast and ke did you first hear about Orange Guy? Well, I'd been I was contemplating taking taking a redundancy at work and on the day before I did, I was. Allowed to leave. I saw the van, which had obviously been up at Old Parliament House doing the actually new parliament house doing where the boys got their Australia Day award.\nAnd I thought, oh, I love doing laundry and I love meeting people, so maybe I could do that as a way of keeping occupied and I've loved it.\nWell, I do my washing here when I can, but I've been here eight years. I've dressed up as Santa Claus. As I said, I'm the queen being clown, so, yeah, it is exactly. And it really is. I mean, you [00:02:00] stop in more to chat than you do really laundry these days. And I'd say most people here are probably more for the conversation 'cause it's such a.\nConvivial atmosphere and it is really a a community with, with everyone. So those, we get, you know, maybe 6, 6, 8 that need to do laundry. And then the rest are just drop-ins to have a chat, tell us what they've been up to, what mischief they've been up to see what to trouble they've been into this week.\nAnd the good news, the bad news, we hear it all. Eight years is a long time to be hanging. Why do you still hang around? Like it's a, it's a significant like, come commitment. What's, what's your reason for this life? I just, as I said, in between work, I just come in, have breakfast talk to see what's happening.\nI volunteer for Salvos in Queenbean as well when I'm not here. So, yeah, it really, yeah, it really is a way to connect. And the thing is, it's, it's, [00:03:00] when we talk about our friends, it really is about friendship. And over eight years, I, I see Paul just as much, if not more than, than friends I've gone to school with and hang out with.\nAnd so we know the ins and outs of each other's lives and it's really nice. It's really nice. So some people you meet for years and then some for a couple of weeks. So, and here's another one. Hey, that's Alan. How Alan, what's going on a good day.\nI'm trying not to be suspicious. Am I not doing a good job? Put me in. Alan rarely does laundry, but again, he's always here. I met him, one of the first people I met all around. He's another one of our little trouble makers. Wash, but they won't wash it. He won't fit in the washing machine. I've tried to put him in, but another one, they won wash me birthday too.\nYeah, he [00:04:00] brings the dad jokes. Alan brings the dad jokes, don't you? The down, been trying to bring your wife down, but she's not comfort. Yeah. So you, yes, you bring doers, big doers and things, but otherwise you've been, you've been around since I started as well. Walking around an old Yes. I don't know, boy.\nAround, around and, and route. So why do you like Orange sky, Alan? Huh? Why do you like orange sky? Why do you like orange sky? I. It is a congenial companionship of the ladies that love it. Ladies, Barry's here today. He might get upset now. They call him, they call him Gertrude. They call him Ger for short and leave off the rude part.\nYeah, well, there you go. Yeah. Oh, this is. A I, yeah, he watch out the, watch [00:05:00] out, the pictures that he takes, and then watch the hour afterwards. You seen the, I I took some photos up in point or whatever they used to. Yeah. And a couple of the ones are still photos. They've used this animation thing on it, and, but the, the daughter stand there with a wife, with his wife, and that was a phone that was a picture, but then all of a sudden.\nI thought goes, goes, oh, it's weird. So what was this for? Just, just changed it. Automatic. Oh. So we get all the stories. We get all the stories. I didn't do it. They, it was done automatic, apparently. Well, that was what I looked at, said I don't remember taking a movie.\nI'm surprised. I'm surprised Elaine hasn't run down here yet. Wow, we haven't seen her today, have we? Maybe she's got time off, so. Yes. And what's the what are you most looking forward to over the next, well, it's been eight years now. What's [00:06:00] next for Orange Sky for this and whatever do you think? Is it just the same old or you intubating?\nWhat's, what's the goal? Well, hopefully they're going to put orange sky, the sleep bus down near the park, near the police station. 'cause we've got a sleep bus that comes in seven days a week. That four or five people that's gotten off the ground, hasn't it? Yeah, four or five people use it every night and whatever it is, they're taking it off, you know?\nSo that's cool. So hopefully we'll have a sleep. The orange sky there too now, so they'll be able to sleep in the bus, wash their clothes, but I think as long as they need, they saw the movie on Sky. You weren't in it. The movie. Orange Sky? Yeah. Called Orange Sky. Well, I dunno, not familiar. Not familiar.\nHe's he's, he's another clown of queen. They're all clowns. They're all clowns. Me. You're not familiar. Always familiar with me.\nAlright. Thank you so much. You're [00:07:00] welcome. \n",

      "Transcript": "Well, the look is like the answer. Can I say your name? What has been told to you? How long have you been here? My name is Enrique López, I am a civil servant. I have been dedicated to juvenile delinquency for 32 years. I also hold a PhD in psychology, specialized in criminal behavior and in dealing with children. And well, I have lived through the previous law that dealt with offenders to the current one. And well, also the entire process of creation, both of the centers and of the work also in closed environments, which we call centers, as well as what is done on the street with the kids. Can you explain a bit about the relationship between the diagram and the administration? Yes, well, according to our law, the competence in the execution of the measures dictated by the juvenile courts is held by the administration. The administration has the ability to... contract or hire foundations or NGOs to carry out, to execute the measures. The administration also does not have, so to speak, enough centers, enough teams, and so it hires them. And from the beginning, this law, dealing with offenders, was also about 25 years ago. We also wondered what model to follow. Where to head, right? And from that moment was also... Diagrama was also starting at that time and we began to talk also about how to carry it out, how to do it. And evidently relying both on the law and at that time also on the international legislation of the UN, what we talked about earlier, that also marks the guidelines or what direction those programs should have. We have also always debated between the part of control, which always has all this type of treatment, the control and punishment, so to speak, reward-punishment, and the more educational, more flexible and more attentive part to the needs of the child. Then also take into account the psychological, social, affective characteristics of the children. Amazing! What has given you the result of the law the most? Is it the law of... I think it's like a little... What do you think is the result or the impact it will have on society in general with the work following this type of models? For the future of the kids... From here or there? From here. From here? Realizing, I mean, how do you think this model has impacted? At the time of... I think children are children and obviously, they have to be treated as children. And if there is something, a fundamental pillar in our model is that they are children and obviously, they are in construction, they are in a process of building their personality. Then in a democratic society, if we want participatory citizens, it must be an inclusive society, that takes all its citizens, without excluding anyone and can also, so to speak, accompany them in the development of that person. These citizens, well obviously, have difficulties in integration, communication with other people. They are excluded from school, they are excluded from environments and here the effort is made, with this type of resources, to try to redirect, so to speak, re-educate in that process, accompany in that process. It is a process of maturation. So I think it is also very important the ages of treatment, both the beginning and the end. And evidently, and one of our principles, the center both in the law and in the work, is the best interest of the child, that is, what is in the child's interest? What does the child need? What are the child's needs at each moment? The punitive aspect is probably less important, so to speak. When do we take it more into account? In those cases that are very serious. For example, if there is a rape, obviously, they might say, the prosecutor requests five years of confinement. You say, well, we don't say anything, there is always the possibility of reducing the measures. But with the other children, even the educational team advises what is most appropriate, according to the characteristics the child has. Then the center is always the best interest of the child, it is the child, their characteristics. And how to accompany in that maturation process. Do you believe the organization that is providing a lot of jobs, provides enough credit for them to get that job? Is it something that is truly a state? Do you think the opportunities that children have after being in the centers, knowing that they come from a Diagrama center, which has the A stamp of having passed through this center or the salsa one or any from Diagrama, what is it that at the time of having opportunities the employers and others, knowing that they come from here, give them more opportunities? Because they know that they have been worked well with them and they come with an experience that many other centers that are not of deprivation of freedom, do not have the same experience that they have here. Do they give them more opportunities because of the type of work that is done? Yes and no. On one hand, yes. It's a principle that it does not appear anywhere that they have been through a juvenile center. It is very important because people always try to judge, we judge others. So, if they see that they have been through La Zarza or have been here, it is possible that they judge them. In fact, the teachers who are here or in La Zarza, put the institute of the town next door, it never says La Zarza or Las Moreras. But something very important to keep in mind is that, when leaving the center, the measures end. Well, afterward it is always accompanied, okay? There is always an open environment measure and there is always a team of educators, which is not from Diagrama, it is from another association, that accompanies them. But the most important thing is that Diagrama also has with the administration some social integration programs. And there is the connection between the kid and the life skills and the skills needed for work. Where it connects. Sometimes, most of the time, it is the employers themselves who also come to demand, and often, through pre-employment training courses, they are inserted. What we do, I mean, what Diagrama does there is accompany them. It's behind, always a step behind. It never goes hand in hand with him, but always behind pushing, supporting. And evidently, there are employers who do know where they come from and support you because they are also supportive and also want that common good for the kid. And evidently, there are others that are done through training courses from other entities and connect normally. But the kid knows that behind, when they look back, they will always have someone from, well say Diagrama, but there will always be someone to support them. I think some people in Australia, if they saw the model, would worry about things like being too kind to the youth, or too touching, or as if there was not enough discipline. What is your opinion on that idea? How would you challenge that? It says that if many people saw this model in Australia, they would criticize the closeness that exists, as extreme closeness with the kids, as if it's too friendly, and as if it's very hard to find. That it's too close. So, how would you answer those people after having seen this model? Yes, people are very basic all over the world, they are very similar. Here too, when a hard case occurs, of a rape, of a homicide, immediately voices come out saying that it needs to be tougher, it should not be allowed, the penal age should be lowered, that movement will always be. But just as it comes, it goes. I think that also, one when seeing this model, should not... one should do things quietly, one should do things naturally, as it is said. One should not make a big deal out of it, because whenever you expose it, you are exposing yourself to judgment. And to anyone's judgment. And more in the times we are living now, which are troubled and hard and prejudiced times. So I think one has to work quietly. Moreover, when things come out, maybe it's not right to say this, but when they come from the heart, when they come from the kindness of accompanying another person, however professional it may be, it is always done from the heart. Even if you work within a system and they pay you, but it is done from the heart. And I think that always has to be quietly, the more kids, also, in the long run, the more they appreciate it. And when at a given moment, you can also put it in society. You can then say, through my hands have passed five thousand kids, and of those five thousand, look, four thousand five hundred are inserted, only five hundred have reached penitentiary institutions, have gone to jail, right? So I think one has to work. From the heart and quietly. Never forget that we are working with a person who is like us. We are not more than that person in front of us, okay? We are not more. I think what also destroys things are power structures. The structure where there is a relationship. You are up, I am down, and I dominate and I control. But it's about combining a bit, and in this system, for example, of minors, I think it is the combination of heart with heart. It's not control, because we have to have it. We also can't be so naive that we remove our fences or remove the guard, right? But it's about combining a bit of control with the educational, affective, and attentive part. Just as with our own child we would also do that. We also control, but we also give a hug, right? Something like that, right? The heart and silence. Last, a bit of... If this were... As a supporter of Valle Grande, as a Spanish person, what would you feel proudest of if this were a success in Australia? What would be the things you'd want to see happen to be proud of that success? What would be the things you'd want to see happen to be proud of that success? As part of this model and as a Spaniard and as... It's that as the translation would be as part of the Diagrama model, I mean, as... Yes, yes. Supporting the Diagrama model, what would make you feel proud to see it work in Australia? Something that tells you, if we manage to achieve in Australia I don't know what, then I would be proud. I think the respect for difference. We are equal and we are also different. So I think one must also respect the one who is different. And know how to welcome them. You can teach them or you can give them a series of resources, but you also have to respect what that person is. Where do they come from? What are they? Who are they? And where do they want to be? We also have, I mean, for example, ethnic minorities. We have many gypsies, many... Right now we also have many Arabs, many Hispanics. And always respect towards that identity. We cannot deny the identity of who is gypsy, take away the identity of being gypsy. Who is Arab, deny them the identity of being Arab, right? But it's about, within that respect, trying to integrate it. Integrate it as well, right? I think it's the key to coexistence. We are all human, but we are also different. So, I would be proud if we managed, through this model of neutrality, to achieve that communities and others saw or respected the identity of the indigenous people. Yes, yes. Well, I said it that way because it's what we talked about in the conversation of... Yes, yes. But... No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. What would make us proud is to know that, through this model, we would get communities to respect the identity of the ethnic minority such as the indigenous. It's true. As we work with... We work with gypsies, with people from Morocco, very minority... Ethnic minorities. And achieving that in Australia, a relationship is made between the integration of minorities that would make us equal. Very pleased. Likewise. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.\n",

Yeah, but how is this connected to justice? Mmm, well, so like, lots of people think justice is like, just a legal thing, right? But justice to us is about Um, it's about like sovereignty and, and spans across so much \n\nSpeaker 13: like health and, you know, housing and, um, the way we learn and raise our baby.\n\nYou know, all of it is I got my cup here too. Is grounded in a search for justice because I'll leave it here. Um, yeah, it's colonisation \n\nSpeaker 14: that's We've experienced a lot of injustice. I feel like I need to be restrained. Yeah, so I \n\nSpeaker 12: think it's crammed in. Definitely walk away with something. I'm sure. [00:04:00] Do you remember doing something similar with your old \n\nSpeaker 14: people?\n\nNo, ok.

Now I'm all right. \n\nSpeaker 13: Rose, I'm going to do a little bit of talking.\n\nHave you got anything to share? Um, right. Yeah. And there's something, like, extra special and powerful when Children are at the centre of things as well, because kids, I think, can really represent the um, um, um, like, hopefully, and, um, there's some, like, like, that dynamic, yeah, that, when kids are at the centre, I think there is, like, real, real power in [00:06:00] knowing that we're safe and \n\nthriving.\n\nSpeaker 13: Spell it.

And then come to be together and And prepare these things for the great works of our staff.\n\nSpeaker 14: Um, so, like, we are \n\nSpeaker 13: relational people. So, um, so there's a lot of, like, obligations that are able to be fulfilled in, in processes like these.

Like, really respected and important elders and people to us.\n\nKnowing Jara, he likes to be everywhere about three hours early.

Yeah, it all \n\nSpeaker 13: comes in response and under guidance from our, from our elders. Oh, you had gestalt beans!\n\nSpeaker 14: And how We're about to the market. Yeah, but how is this connected to justice? Mmm, well, so like, lots of people think justice is like, just a legal thing, right? But justice to us is about Um, it's about like sovereignty and, and spans across so much \n\nSpeaker 13: like health and, you know, housing and, um, the way we learn and raise our baby.\n\nYou know, all of it is I got my cup here too. Is grounded in a search for justice because I'll leave it here. Um, yeah, it's colonisation \n\nSpeaker 14: that's We've experienced a lot of injustice. I feel like I need to be restrained. Yeah, so I \n\nSpeaker 12: think it's crammed in. [00:10:00] Definitely walk away with something. I'm sure. Do you remember doing something similar with your old \n\nSpeaker 14: people?\n\nNo, ok. So this is like, this is an important, like, \n\nSpeaker 13: Oh no, thanks anyway, Kayden. I'll probably drink a little. Yeah, thank you. Um, no, so like, we are at a point in like my own \n\nSpeaker 14: family's journey that, um, \n\nSpeaker 13: has seen You know, like, because of people here nurturing us, we're, we're like, rebuilding, oh, and like, um, Kiri's dad talks about it all the time, like this nation rebuilding, that, you know, we're, we're coming home, so, um, yeah, so this is, this is, This is important to us because it's all about rebuilding and reconnecting.\n\nMy great grandma moved across to the [00:11:00] mainland \n\nSpeaker 14: with her eight kids. \n\nSpeaker 13: And, \n\nSpeaker 14: you know, the generations \n\nSpeaker 13: have all lived and grown up on the mainland.

      "Transcript": "David Allen - Friend - Doveton\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 11: All right, so we're going to start.\n\nI didn't get it sharp before so I'm very, I want to make sure it goes sharp.\n\nDavid: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 11: So you tell me your name, your full name and spell it.\n\nDavid: My name is David Allen and Jean Allen was my wife. When she had a child, she had 75 percent brain damage. It took 10 years to get to walk and talk, but she tried and tried every day to get better.\n\nIt's called, the book is called, Waiting for the Sunshine, One Day at a Time.\n\nSpeaker 11: Tell me a little bit more about yourself.\n\nDavid: Ah, yeah, I don't know what to say. I was born in England and then we [00:01:00] found that we couldn't get on in England so Jeannie and I was caught in and we decided we'd come to Australia. She put in for Australia first and got permission to come before I could.\n\nSo she got on a big ocean liner and came all the way across the world on her own, just for me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nDavid: So when she was having a child, things went wrong. Obviously I must stand by her because, as I said, she came all the way across the world for me. And then, when she was sick, she had the child, she had 75 percent brain damage, which was caused.\n\nToday, they've got a name for it. It's called a clampsia today. In those earlier days, we didn't know what to call it. But they nursed her and looked [00:02:00] after her at the Hamilton Hospital, which saved her life. It was impossible to believe. How many people came to help me?\n\nSpeaker 11: What's it like having people to help?\n\nWhat does that feel like? Oh,\n\nDavid: it's phenomenal. In those days, you just couldn't believe the kind of help and people that came. It was tremendous. One lady had five children, two adopted children, and offered to take care of Jean's baby for 14 months. I said, because Jean was that ill, she couldn't look after the child at all.\n\nYeah. And so many people helped me along the way, it was unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 11: Have you ever used the Orange Sky for washing?\n\nDavid: Yes, I have. What do you\n\nSpeaker 11: think of Orange Sky?\n\nDavid: Oh, I think it's a terrific idea. Especially nowadays that things are getting tough. And you need somewhere to bring it to. If [00:03:00] you're sleeping in your car, or anywhere, sleeping about, you need to be able to bring everything down to get washed and cleaned.\n\nAnd these meals that's out and about is tremendous. We really couldn't do without them. What's it\n\nSpeaker 11: Having people to talk to and having a community? What's it like having people to talk to and a community? Yeah,\n\nDavid: Of course, we come round these places. To meet people and talk with them and keep you associated with what's going on and around you.\n\nMakes a big difference, yeah. Oh yeah, you'd be terribly lonely and stuck if you were just at home on your own and not able to get out and see these people. Yeah, absolutely. But it's surprising how many of them you meet in so many different places, all the same situation. Oh yeah, it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 11: Do you get to talk to lots of different people here?\n\nDo they have lots of different stories [00:04:00] and experiences? Oh yes,\n\nDavid: everybody that comes to these. Food, places, or meals. Of course they have different stories and have worked different ways in life. I said, and then found myself completely stuck because I said it's changed now. If you haven't got it, you will never be able to get it at the moment in Australia.\n\nIt's just got beyond the working man to be able to afford to live.\n\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And,\n\nWhat's what are some things next for you? I've got some, tell me more about the book and like what you're doing with it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, with the book it encourages people that Say they've lost their job, they've got two or three children, the bank's knocking on the door for the house, and they're going to lose their house or their car.\n\nThe book encourages them to show what you can get through as long as you've got your partner and stay together. There's nothing like having reasonable good health, [00:05:00] your partner and your family. Nothing else matters. The house and the car doesn't even matter at all. What difference does it make? You lose the house but as long as you've got your family and your partner then you've got everything.\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm really interested in stories. What do you, and you've obviously written a book. Why do you think stories are important and why do you think books are important? I\n\nDavid: think the story is so important in the book because it encourages people to stay together and to be able to get through tough times.\n\nAs I said, Jeannie was so ill, it took 10 years to get her to walk and talk. It took 30 years for, to try and run a home. I said, but that's the why the story is really going very well. It, for these times when things are tough and you're struggling so much, it really helps you with the [00:06:00] family and stay together.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: If you were to tell someone why they should buy the book, this is your chance, why should people buy the book?\n\nDavid: They'll never remember or they won't have nothing left from their legacy or their entire life of struggling or the way they've gone through life. So if you can write a book about your life, how you started, how you found your partner and how you progressed and struggled through life, this is why you need to write a book.\n\nBecause you won't have a legacy to leave behind unless you've got a book of your life story.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what do you hope happens with the book? What do you hope is the outcome\n\nDavid: of it? We're hoping that it'll help a lot of people that's struggling. And there's so many people came to me and said, Oh look, you've wrote a book.\n\nfor sharing the book with me. Because she'd got three [00:07:00] children and was losing the house to the bank. And she was in tears when she thanked me for sharing the story. I said, this is what the story's about. It's to try and get people to stay together. And be together, I said, this is a, this is what it's about, it's to get you through tough times, when you think you're struggling and having bad times, you can understand how, if you stay together, you can get through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what's where are you going back to tonight? Where are you staying, and what's that like?\n\nDavid: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 11: Where are you staying\n\nDavid: at the moment? Oh, I've got my own house. So I'll be going home to my house. But of course I'm on my own now, so it makes an awful difference. Without coming round for these meals and coming to these places, oh, it's such a hard time staying and living on your own.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: It was amazing to hear your [00:08:00] story. I'm going to buy one of your books. Yes. On Amazon? Buy it on Amazon?\n\nDavid: Yes, buy it from Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Yes. Cool. You will thoroughly enjoy it, and you'll be amazed on how many people. Like the story because it gets them to stay together and none of this family violence and all that.\n\nJust please understand that you've met together in the first place because you wanted to. So no having the nonsense of family violence or anything like this. Just be there for one another. And you'll really get life better.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing. Alright, I'm gonna get your details so I can\n",

      "Transcript": "Dimibra - Ithaca\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nI do this a lot, so hopefully I ask good questions. I don't knows Nic. Nic makes, and I hate cameras, so, oh, you look at me then you're, that's not even there. And this is just, just me talking. Uh, cool. So just your name and spell it this first? Yeah. My name is Ria and I'm the director here at Daka. And how do you spell your name?\n\nD-I-M-I-B-R-A. Amazing. How, how did you end up being director, um, with Vigo? Well, um, I started working here as an operations manager. Uh, the organization, uh, had started operating only like six months. Uh, so it was like, I was the first employee here. Uh, it was me, uh, and the homeless guy cooperated the van.\n\nHe was the driver and he was serving all the people. Come here. Uh, it was like a. It come true for me. What, what is it that's special about this? Like, is it the people, is it the [00:01:00] services? It making a difference? How do you work out what's really important to you for you? Uh, to be honest, before I started working here at dca, I had no idea how important it is for a human being to have the right.\n\nUm, to have clean clothes and be able to like, socialize and communicate with others. Um, so for me, uh, helping people have clean clothes, it's about dignity, um, and about having equal rights with everyone. Cool. What's a normal sort of event shift look like here for you? Like. What's it feel like for you and what's it look like?\n\nIt's crowded, it's nice and crazy. Um, we have many different people come here. They all have, uh, the same needs. Um, we also have, uh, other days we operate with a van and we also have a social service operating right next to the mobile laundry unit. So it's [00:02:00] like we are trying to help them integrate socially by not supporting them only to have clean clothes.\n\nAnd to have access to other services also. Um, it's also very important because they can like, socialize with each other. Mm. And for us and for them, it's like a safe space for them. Cool. Um, what's, like, did you have to fight to make this happen? And do you continue to have to like, fight to make this happen?\n\nAnd how does that look? Um, in terms of like an organizational strength type? To be honest, yes. It's like, uh, an everyday, uh, struggle because, uh, in order to operate the mobile logging unit, we have to get permission from the state. Uh, so this is a bit difficult. Uh, we operate since 2017. Uh, though it's a bit difficult to operate in different spots.\n\nUm. And yes, we try hard to change [00:03:00] policies and make them understand that this should happen, uh, in any place that people have the same need. What do you think the general community's, um, perception of people who are doing a tough arm? Like do you think in Grayson in Athens, there is a, um, general sense of there needs to be support, or is there some negative stereotypes?\n\nLike how do, how does that sort of, how do you feel like that happens? I think that we face both. Uh, there are people that they, they want help and contribute to the community and to those who are in need. And there are also people who have stereotypes, uh, that have grown all these years and that keep growing, uh, you know, even from, uh, media.\n\nAnd I think that maybe, uh, one of the most vulnerable relations are homeless and refugees and migrants. Uh, and it's kind [00:04:00] of difficult to fight all this fear that it's grown inside of America. Um, there's a bunch of people here today from all around the world, and we're talking about what it feels like to come together to to, to do a something.\n\nWhat do you think that something is and, and why do you think that is important? For me, it's uh, very important to have this allowance. Uh. Because we will, uh, like, um, enhance our impact. Uh, it will empower all organizations that we try to support these people. Um, and I think it's very, uh, important to, to establish.\n\nThe hygiene is a basic human, um, uh, need and Right. Um, have you got a bit of a vision for the future, um, of ICA and then also globally? What's, what's that look like? 5, 10, 20 years? What's the, what's the cast of vision for me to [00:05:00] be? I think that that my vision and every NGO's vision would be to see is existing because.\n\nAll the needs will be covered. So Interesting. Um, and what year, what do you hope to get out of today? I guess, um, having these people here from around the world. What's, what's the, what's the best outcome of having people here and leaving today? Feeling full. I want to know how they do their own, uh, operations and how they support, uh, other people in other countries.\n\nWhat are their challenges? What are their best practices so we can like, uh, exchange knowledge and we can support this other. Amazing. Well done. Thank.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Bernie Moran\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThat's the way, I dunno. Years ago when I was a kid we traveled a bit with mom and dad around Australia or down south and that sort of thing, and he'd get the light meter out and then he'd get the distance meter out. Then he'd just set all these bloody things. I lucky I don't have to deal with that days.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That's all. Thank God. I think we're looking good. All so you just look at me, have yarn. First thing we need is do your, say your full name Yep. And then spell the whole thing for me. It'll be awesome. Yep. Bernard, Michael Moran. Spell on Christian names or no? Just a surname.\n\nSurname. M-O-R-A-N. And yeah, I live in Toowoomba. Amazing. So tell us a little bit about yourself, Bernie. Yeah, I was born in Maureen New South Wales. There's a few people from New South Wales, or Mae in particular that gravitate to Toowoomba because it's a good city medic. Don't clap my hands.\n\nSorry. Did I clap my hands? Should I clap my hands? I need to do that. Oh. But always forget to do it, so right up. Yep. Okay. I'll do again. Sorry. Yeah. So yeah, born in Mae and I [00:01:00] spent, we had a family farm, but I lost my dad before I was born. So mum married a second time, and I had brothers and sisters, or stepbrothers and sisters from there.\n\nAnd we had a property. And during one of the droughts I was finished school and, I started to work well. I was working on the farm and then went to town to get a job because of the drought and being a stepchild. I just felt that the farm wasn't big enough to be divided among the four of us.\n\nSo I worked at as a car salesman that then got called up for two years. National service training. Which meant well the boss was to keep my job. And I said I don't expect you to keep a job. And it was only a four man business for two years. But anyway, that was a requirement and he did that.\n\nWhen I came back from the Army we had purchased a case header. And for the farm, and we needed a service. So I said to the salesman we, we need a service. And he said, I'll leave it till next week, [00:02:00] because J Case, the manufacturer was taking over the dealership. I. I took it there. I said have they got any, have they got any jobs going, retail jobs?\n\nAnd he said, I dunno. And anyway, came back a while later and said, you've got an appointment this afternoon for a position with them and selling. And being on a rural background and knowing the area I got that position. So I was very successful in selling farm machinery in the early seventies. 76, they, transferred me to Wagga as an area manager looking after New South Southern New South. And after I'd been down there three years, the manager that I had had retired and they said, we want you to come back to Mare. I said no not far Wagga, I'm only an hour to the snow and an hour to Griffith and good water skiing and plowing dam and those sort of places.\n\nBut anyway, they made it worth my while and I came back and managed that for eight years until Case bought International Harvester. And because we had a [00:03:00] company store in Maori and there was already an international dealership there, they saw an opportunity to get outta company owned branches. So they closed that up, moved me up here to Toowoomba and I hired and fired the dealers on the downs and that they wanted.\n\nAnd when I'd done that three months later, they said, what's what we needed to do? We don't need you anymore. And I was retrenched. I'd said, because selling machinery when I was doing it was just a brilliant time. And I said I wouldn't stay in that business. So I went into hardware and it was 30 years worth.\n\nThe local might 10 store up here ended up being one of the purchasing offices until I retired. And then when I retired, I spent probably three years at home doing the painting jobs that you put off while you're working. I had a three bay shed, which needed tidying up. Wife used to keep telling me to tidy the shed, but, it just went on and on. It's a hard job to do that. And I've just now sold that property because it was acreage and we've moved into [00:04:00] town. And we're on a smaller block and obviously don't have a shed, so I have to eliminate a lot of the stuff. And she'd say you should go and do it otherwise the boys, the son-in-law and son are gonna have to do it.\n\nAnd I said when they go in there, when I'm gone, they can throw it all out 'cause they don't own it. But I've got a connection to it. And I found that difficult to have to do. I've eliminated a lot of stuff before we moved. But I've got stuff out at my son's place that I need to go through and choose what I want.\n\nBut I did a lot of woodworking when I when I was working and had lots of tools for that. But I had a need for doing that because I built bedroom suites and cupboards and things for my daughter before she was married. And then when the kids came along built toys and so forth. But. That need's gone because my eldest grandchild is 24 and the youngest is 13, so I don't need to make them toys and that sort of thing.\n\nSo I don't have a need. I like to do [00:05:00] things if there's a need for it, but if there's no need I don't see a point. So I haven't done any woodwork for a long time, so I can afford now to reduce the tools in the shed and so forth. But wow. And that was after, after three, for about three years. I think I was retired when I was approached by a friend of mine and pushed by my wife to join Tom.\n\nThat, so I did. And I came into Tom that only a couple of months before COVID hit. So that changed the way that Tom had operated. We used to meet. Once a month down at a hall or a club just down the road. But we couldn't do that then because of the isolation and distancing.\n\nSo we went into recess, for three or four months until we worked out that we could have smaller sessions here. And the earlier sessions we were limited to probably five or six people at each session. But now because the covid sort of under control. We can have [00:06:00] up to 2025 meeting here.\n\nAnd so we meet, we have four sessions a week like the one you witnessed this morning. Also today we have lunch with mates. So we go to a club and have lunch. Just another way of getting outta the room here. And that's on this afternoon. And then go on and do what I gotta do for the kids coming down for Easter.\n\nThat I'm still working on tidying up the yard in this property that we've purchased. But so awesome. I I came into Tom that the president that was here, was president at the time, was a Moree fellow as an accountant. And he used to do my books for me when I was working and so forth.\n\nSo I knew him quite well and, i'm fairly casual about being president, but he was less formal than even I am. So he just said I'm gonna retire. We want you to go as president. And I said no. There's people that have been here for 15, 20 years and I've only been here a couple years, but I suppose you call [00:07:00] it railroading.\n\nBut anyway that's how I. I ended up in the chair here. But I'm enjoying it. I do it casually. I do a lot of volunteering in a lot of the different sections. Not, I can't spread myself thin enough to go to everything, but I'd like to get to nursing homes. My wife and I, as I said in the center there a while ago, that we can involve women.\n\nIn a volunteering role? To get, I found that my wife was inclined to stay home now too, so I went on, volunteered at a childminding center, which I could take her to. We volunteered at that for a while, but now that we've moved, we're right across the opposite side of town, so I'll either have to look.\n\nAt some other day, daycare center to go to or something like that. But that was one of the sessions I then do, I'm on the barbecue team. I've got a team that I work with each month we do the barbecue at hardware store. And I've got my team and I alternate with another fellow that does the other [00:08:00] month.\n\nSo every second month we've got that on. But we've just done Harmony day which was a, a community center a community function, put on down at the Grand Central Shopping Center, be a Tom that cater or did the cooking the food was supplied. So we were just supplied with that food. We served that up.\n\nThat's an international thing that they have each year, bringing all the I suppose refugees are included, but anyone that moves from another country, kind comes and celebrates Harmony day here. But yeah, there's a lot of that. I do go to a nursing home probably not as frequently as I would like, but my calendar can fill up fairly quickly in different functions I have to attend to.\n\nBut but I, I'm enjoying it. And, it was my wife that realized that after three years at home, admittedly looking after an acreage block took a lot of work. But there was still times that I felt a bit of a loose end. Came to Tom that, and now I don't have a loose end at all to worry about.\n\nShe has told me that probably ought to take my bed down, but, that's the way it [00:09:00] goes. But I'm enjoying it. And, the company's still growing. We're getting more people in all the time and yeah, that's great. We're certainly, we're increasing numbers more than we're losing them, and I think that's great.\n\nSo why do you as people are new people are coming, what are the changes you're seeing in them as they first come? And make sense of what this is initially, and then what's their progression like as they spend more time with you? As we said in there, walking through the door the first time is the hardest thing.\n\nParticularly if you don't already know someone in there. I was fortunate and I knew three people that were in there, so it was easier for me. But the barbecue we held on Saturday, though, I think there were five of us working that barbecue. And Greg and another fellow walked past and wanted to know what we did.\n\nWho we were and so forth. And a lot of people ask what Tom that is, and it's the Alder Men's Network is the full title of it. He, they both had he yarn to, to some of us that were up there [00:10:00] cooking. That was on Saturday. Greg turned up on Monday and signed up. And was here again today. So the other fellow has come and he's taken the paperwork to join.\n\nSo when you see them come in they're hesitant that they're not sure what they're coming into, but within a few weeks they, they're entirely different person in the, what they open up, they chat about all sorts of things, but we encourage them when they do come to talk about themselves. So that.\n\nWe know what their career was, what the history was, where they live and a bit about them from that point. But yeah, it brings them out of their shell enormously, I must say. And how, what do you think is the benefit of not just coming and interacting with other people in a similar situation, but then going into the community and offering time and offering support in the community as well to people that may be young people or migrant?\n\nOr refugees as you're saying. Yes. [00:11:00] With that getting people out, it is one thing to get them out of the home and get them into here, but getting them out into the community is just more doors are open. More opportunities to volunteer with people. And that, that brings them out as well.\n\nAnd sometimes we might carpool to go over to a nursing home. So you've got that where you're talking to these people on a lesser number. But that also encourages them to come out, I think. And and listen to what else is going on. But the volunteering is a big help and there's not many other organizations that, that I know of.\n\nThey do it the way Tom, they'd do there. There's a lot that meet in the room and stay in the room. But getting out is another thing I think that that opens it up further. What I always love this word, wisdom and intelligence, his two words. What do you think Tom Net is able to offer the community within a wisdom and intelligence and experience?\n\nI think we're doing that with the [00:12:00] intergenerational support that we're giving to one of the public schools up here at centenary Heights. We go there and the, there's some kids there in year 12 that, that can't read and write that have come in from overseas. So we're involving them.\n\nWe might only play a bit of ball game or darts or something with. With kids to, to educate them a little bit in, in the lifestyles of Australia and things like that. Plus the mentoring at the Flexi School, it helps develop those kids and the kids change enormously from when they arrive there in year 10 until they graduate in year 12.\n\nIt's amazing the difference it makes through, yeah, I think that's important that we get out and we do help the community with various barbecues and anyone that wants something, some hand with something, we can join in with that. We have a good relationship with. East Creek, which is a community center that to drop in place that we do barbecues for them.\n\nAnd they have a lot of foreign [00:13:00] people call there and they have a food pantry too that people contribute to and pick. They pick up, food that's almost out of date. And they can give that out to to the various people that are having a bit of financial trouble in supplying food. One thing I always think about is, a lot of people are speeding through life so they can retire. And a lot of people are spending their life working to make money to retire. And I think some things I was thinking about my father and my mother in those situations and Yep. What sort of like wisdom and experience would you be able to offer to people that are maybe in their thirties or forties or fifties who are like spending the majority of the time thinking about how they can.\n\nGet to retirement rather than living your own. Yes. Yeah. I I don't know. I guess I I worked hard and worked continuously. I started working. I was 16, still going to school, working in [00:14:00] the store after after school and then going on to the farm and then various jobs on the way through. So I've always.\n\nBeen in work. Thank God. What I've found now we've got to the retirement age and we've saved to get, to have money to to retire with. So I'm not on a pension. I, we're self-funded. We live off our superannuation fund, but then I've got friends that. I've done a world trip or an overseas trip every year, all their working lives.\n\nAnd they're sitting down now on a full pension. And that makes me wonder at times did I do it right or did I do it wrong? A few years ago, I might have said I'd done, I had done it wrong. But now the risk of there not being a pension and. Maybe not too distant future, saving for your future is more important now than possibly was.\n\nYeah. There's so much I think that people can spend time talking with people who have retired and like [00:15:00] understanding that process a lot better. Yeah I would, as I said I would've thought maybe I was better off when I was 30 to. Couple of overseas trips, but I've only been to New Zealand and Tasmania and Norfolk Island.\n\nBut that's as far as I've been outta the country. But I've toured the country and I enjoy the country and I think we've got great things to offer here. But you saving for your future is an important thing. Yep. What's what do you think the next sort of few years is in store for Tom Net? Or what do you hope might happen over the next?\n\nI'm hoping that it, that will continue to grow like it is growing as I said, we've recently opened up the Laia Valley and we've got three branches going down there at CAT and Laley and plain Land. But we need, we live on government funding. We've got two paid staff here, and we get government and some state government and some federal government funding.\n\nAnd because we don't have membership fees or anything, we have [00:16:00] to work on that. Wherever we can get the funding, we can go ahead, but if one of the either the federal or the state were to reduce our funding or cut us out altogether I dunno where we'd go because we've got a management committee.\n\nWe were talking just the other day about that. If we were to lose. To lose funds, we'd have to lose a staff member. And I just, they're that busy that we can't afford to operate without one of them, and it would be very detrimental to Tom net. If funding was reduced and what would be, if there was people that were interested or on the fence of supporting Tom.\n\nIs there a core message that you have that well come through that's come to the fore just recently and that maybe we can talk to some of the the people that are influential in town and situated to, to donate and so forth, whether we talk to those sort of people.\n\nTry and get something. But but we continued to work like Shannon particularly tirelessly on, on applying for [00:17:00] grants from government departments. But mental health is a big issue. Men over 65 are overrepresented in male suicides in the 25 years that Tom that's been in operation. We've got 295 members.\n\nWe haven't lost a member. To suicide. And I put that all down to the comradery and the friendship that we have by discussing various things and looking after men's health in general, plus mental health. Yeah that, that's important. Amazing. Was there anything that we didn't cover you think, that you wanted to make sure you said or any like things, topics or themes or, no the main thing and everybody, as I said, I'm president of the management committee and they were, they're a good team of people.\n\nWe've got a cross section in that and that we've got a barrister, a magistrate principles and that sort of stuff. It's a cross section in there as well as it is through Tom that and. Older men. Looking after older men is is probably the main thing that we need to get [00:18:00] through. But word of mouth is a big thing by talking to people.\n\nYeah. But I just hope it can continue to grow. Amazing. Well done. Thanks Bernie. You're so good. Okay. We'll just take a quick photo.\n\n",

He's not about to drive nothing. And I mean when the, our people got their license taken off. What else they gonna do? A lot of old people, 84 now lot of people get port. They just tell them that's what happened. Yeah, I was still driving.\n\nIt's, it's funny when we see our, our, our aunties and uncles driving, we wave and they're like,\n\nwell, I haven't, I haven't lived really, what, 25 years? Wow. Yeah.

Everything. Yeah,\n\neverything started.\n\nYeah, when we grew up bloody lovely, Aboriginal went back to their communities everywhere. Back. Yeah. So, uh, thank you. Yeah, and [00:08:00] my grandmother worked all the way from in town. The only people that in, yeah. Yeah. Up.\n\nUm, so I, I've been trying to work out what, what story Alice Springs has. So my, I've been traveling around, um, some like Stradbroke Island. Oh, okay. Yep. Down to Kalgoorlie, um, up to Palm Island, uh, Bookman. Oh. Um, and then over to Caldoon. Mount Isa. Oh yeah. Um, so yeah, there's lots of, um. Lots of different people trying to do good stuff with young people.\n\nOh yeah. I think it's all over, right? Yeah. But they're really struggling to get the [00:09:00] resource or the money to do it. So yeah, I've been traveling around trying to work out how you can make sure the resource goes to the right places. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.\n\nWarm. Warm it up the microwave. Warm it up. Can we have warm milk? Warm milk? Warm. Make more? Yeah, sure.\n\nIt's true. Thank you. Warm up. Thank you. Sorry. Warm. Warm. Thank you.[00:10:00] \n\nYeah, and they give, what's the point? My, my grandmother's the saying she's, she's 91 and she drinks the hottest tea I've ever seen. Yeah, there's a mouth. Must be resilient to heat.\n\nYeah. When you are having breakfast, I,\n\nyeah. Iqua. Oh yeah, that's good. Where did. Um, yeah, so I live in Brisbane. Oh yeah, thank you. But Oh, did you? Yeah, I went there. Yeah. Just, oh, okay. [00:11:00] Uncle Tony's, granddaughters live in, uh, great grandparents. One great grand, no. Granddaughter. Sarah. Sarah and um, too are that And then Yeah. Yeah. Right. I've been in except Really?\n\nYeah, we should come. I've been actually, we'll see. Yeah. Rain and Oh yeah. It's bad there. Now. Don't come now. No, no. But I, um, I grew up in a place called Muscle Brook. Which is, um, the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, down where there, there's a lot of coal mines, um, and wineries and things there. So in Newcastle kind of, yeah.\n\nClose to Sydney Valley.\n\nYeah. Yeah.[00:12:00] \n\nSo by the time I found back for two weeks, so yeah. Yeah. We don't get see him that many people. Sure. Muhammad doesn't talk. Yeah. Yeah, I know him. Yeah. Wow. Um. So, yeah, I was wondering if it's okay if I, um, recorded our conversation. Is that okay with you?\n\nReally? Yeah. We take any barb everywhere. Oh, she's a little ipy person. Click that on your shirt somewhere close to your shirt or somewhere around. So do I just like see this like that? Just clip it, your shirt.\n\nIt's got a little thing there[00:13:00] \n\nas what.\n\nIt's a bit different. It's a, there's a magnet on it, which is Oh, that, yeah. That way. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nHow do you, um, how do you usually introduce yourself? Like if someone asks you, how do you say, Barbara? Barbara.\n\nSome like to say traditional owner or whatever. I said, don't worry me it, whether it's got that or not, custodian or whatever. Yeah. We are custodians and from, yeah, that's awesome. I do a lot of welcomes around town, mainly for the big GOs that come into town and have their conferences there. Mm-hmm. [00:14:00] So every year I do for them.\n\nAnd how does, how does that feel for you? Like doing that stuff? It doesn't worry. I used to be a bit shy, but yeah, I've done it with like 600, nearly a thousand people sometimes. Wow. Yes. So it just comes natural and I never read anything. Everything comes from what I.\n\nAnd what sort of, um, have you had sort of jobs and stuff over the, your lifetime, different things? Oh yeah. I, uh, I worked at the hospital before. There was a new one built for three years after I left school. Oh, wow. Yeah, so then I, I left school in 1959, worked at the hospital. My dad said if I didn't get a job, I had to go back when I was turning 18.\n\nI said, no way am I going back to school when I'm 18. So I worked, got when put in for the job straight away and I was a wards mate at the [00:15:00] hospital. Oh, wow. So I stayed there for three years and then, uh, got married in 1963. Where did you get married? At the Flynn Church Here. Yeah. Right. And when, uh, the day we got married, it was, uh, mum said, because she reckoned my, my dreaming was water.\n\nAnd she said that, uh, there's gonna be big rain tonight. I said, there's hardly any clouds around. But when we went into the church and come out, it was really cloudy. And then we went driving and, and we had the reception of the RSL put a bezac over little, nobody even think we had the biggest rain. Never knew it was raining.\n\nYeah. When we come out to have a look, the tide was running bank to bank. And, and one of my cousins said, you can't go home now because the TODs didn't flood. So me and my husband and a couple other family members, we had to walk all the way from the harvest hill over down [00:16:00] Anzac oval, across the bridge.\n\nAnd the bridge, the water was right up just about that, the bridge. Wow. So I always say I was the only bride that ever walked across the Todd River on the bridge. And that was in 1963. Yeah. What, what did Alice feel like in 1963? Like what was the town like? Oh, I thought, I think it was really good. Yeah.\n\nRight up to, I reckon it would've. Right up to about the eighties, nineties, that's when everything sort of changed. Yeah, yeah. But it sort of doesn't worry us, but I mean you as for the towns people, but I hate these high rises. I reckon they'd spoil the character of Alice friends. I even told that on a DC too, that the high rise buildings they're putting up everywhere.\n\nYeah. You know, I mean, when you get up on an [00:17:00] keel, have you been up on Anza? Yeah. Yeah. I was up there the other day, sunset. And the view is, it's like a pan Panorama, beautiful, know. Amazing. Yeah. And what, what building came into your eyesight when you got up there? That egg thing? Courthouse, whatever. It's, it's horrible.\n\nOh, it's disgusting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's like a, because Yeah, I know what you mean. And even the, um, the large shopping center sort of buildings Yeah. Have white rooms. Yeah. Really like, yeah. But I mean, I, I mean, the limit before was three stories. Yeah. But people wanna go, it's stupid. Having a real, you've taken the view of the whole.\n\nArea of the gap and everywhere, you know? Well, it seems weird too 'cause there's so much space. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of space here. There. That's right. Yeah. And they got this ugly looking thing that's aboriginal people call it the Un Underwood Ark instead of Noah's Ark. Yeah. Oh yeah.[00:18:00] \n\nIs Aboriginal word for that way? Mm. Because I reckon more aboriginal people go in there. Right. Support the linear, so that's why they named it that. Oh yeah. That's a lot.\n\nYeah. And I mean, the nurses port is, that's, that's, you can just see the nurse's orders, but I reckon they built that in the wrong spot. Too big. If it floods, that's going underground. Is gonna get flood the car park. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, when you're telling people, oh, don't do this, don't do that. They think, oh, okay.\n\nIt's all right. They don't listen to the old people. Mm. Yeah. All that. And so you've got plenty of grandkids running around or I've got 12 grandkids. Yeah. Uh, 11. Great grandkids. [00:19:00] And three daughters. How do you keep track of that? Oh, I don't, they don't come where they want me. They come to me. Well, I've got one grandson lives in Sydney.\n\nYep. With his little family, and he got a little boy, I think they're back from trial down there. They went over there a couple of weeks. Then we, one grandkids in Darwin, he, he works just outta Darwin on the mines river mines. And I've got, um, the other ones are all here. Mainly, uh, the eldest daughter's kids are all here and the grannys.\n\nAnd I've got a granddaughter living in Cairns. She's got a little boy. Oh, Aubrey. And then, uh, yeah, another granddaughter in Bury was on. We just come back from there. From her 40th birthday. Yep. And then, uh, yeah, all the rest of them were here working. They got, got their own business. Oh really? Daughter?\n\nYeah. That's cool. Daughter. And her, [00:20:00] her husband and her daughter And her son. Yep. Her husband, sorry. They've got the pest control business. They're doing really good too. So they've got mainly all family working with them. Yeah. See, that's good that, um, yeah, there's opportunities for Oh yeah, yeah. Well their grandsons used to work at the mines at the Yeah, they Newman mines, but they didn't like the flying in and out.\n\nThey were there for like four or five years. Yeah. And then they gave it up and, you know, they're working with their mother and father that now the spray thing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we've been very busy. Mm. Yeah. I've, I've, I think I've only been to Alice once before, but it seems to be talked about a lot. Oh, everyone talks about Alice Ring.\n\nYeah. Oh [00:21:00] yeah. I came here. Um, there's a place I, I do some work at called Aim. And they do, um, indigenous mentoring. Oh yeah. And there's a fellow that works. There used to be a Geelong Katz player. His name's Matthew Stokes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. So we went, um, from Ulu to Darwin and stopping in on lots of.\n\nOh, okay. Skills and stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because the other, the kids love Yeah. Kicking the footy with him and Oh yeah. Doing stuff. So, well, there's one good thing that's going on here now with Jason Lord. Yeah. Doing the boxing with all, I was there, um, at a launched the other day on Monday. I think he launched, we took a few weeks.\n\nOur kids go to the boxing. Yeah. So they had the launch and he just happened to be here at the time. Oh yeah. No, he is a lovely person. Yeah. Jason, the boxing, his new chef. No, they just met him. That was on Friday, the day [00:22:00] I got here. Yeah. Friday. Yeah. Friday. Yeah. Friday they did the launch. A new facility. Oh yeah.\n\nSo they're not over near the. They've gone back over where they've really started, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a nice spot. It's more, yeah. But, uh, I try to get, um, people interested in helping him out, having, uh, bits and telling or counsel and whatever, even to extend the, where they were at the Anzac oval to extended right back where all that cement and put up a new building for him and look all the space and they got the oval right there for training and everything.\n\nBut no, they're worrying about the art gallery and all that crap. I've heard there's a bit of conjecture about this art gallery. Well, I think that's going underground now, hopefully. Yeah. It's a, it's a pretty interesting like strategy or processes going down. Didn't sound like it was a very well put out.\n\nNo, no. [00:23:00] I mean, they were gonna take the oval away from us. Yeah. And we fought hard, so we got the oval back and rugby back to where thing originally started. Yeah. Yeah. We tried to get that, um, the heritage listed, the whole, whole, that area. Yep. Heritage listed. But they said because of World War ii, the army that was the army barracks there, and we tried to save the whole lot, but they only saved the totem clubhouse for goodness sake.\n\nMy dad heritage listed nothing else. Hmm. So we tried to get that whole area right around to the back creek and the back road Half hungry Jack, the whole area. Yeah. And they said it wasn't heritage listed. And that's from coming from Darwin, people who don't even live here. Yeah. And that, yeah, because Chrisy was saying there's not even really a, there, a tipper sort of center or anything like any type of cultural center or?\n\nNo, only the um. Well, [00:24:00] nobody's sort of interested in it, really. Mm-hmm. There's not too many of our artists say, you know, from here, they're all from out of town. Yeah. And do all their art artwork. You see all these old artists that walk around town, they're all from out of the other communities. Right? Yeah.\n\nBut I mean, even my brother, when we had the thing, why do you want out there, you taken away when the old people sit on the streets and sell their art. Just for a couple of dollars and that's stopping that thing too, but yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's fascinating. Yeah.\n\nWhat, what do you reckon needs to be more like, do you think there needs to be more, well put that down where they knock the old school down. They should have kept that. I went to, we went to school there. I with easier, I. They knocked it down overnight. Wow. Even though reckon it was full of asbestos, for goodness sake, we went there.\n\nSchool, [00:25:00] no one suffered with asbestos. Yeah. Yeah. But I, the school anac high. Did you go there? Yes. Anac little school. Oh yeah. Yeah. I.\n\nFrom half.\n\nWhat was school like? What was school like? School was good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we were, we went at the convent pool.\n\nJust.[00:26:00] \n\nIt was horrible too. In that condo. Yeah, condo. Then we went on St. Mary's. The boys went to St. Mary's. Yeah. Down there. Down. And I didn't go because mum and dad. Mum was in town. That's why I stayed in town to do. And what was St. Mary's like? Was that different? Ask. Like at the convent, you was just boxed in, you boxed in in the yard.\n\nWe weren't even man outside the fence. But with with Mary, we could walk anywhere on the weekend all over. That was in.\n\nWhere's your mother? Oh,\n\nkids today. They missed out on a lot because they don't, [00:27:00] so that's what said a lot of them don't even know how to write. Yeah. Too much computer and bones. No one knows how to write. Yeah. Yeah. I've noticed that with a lot of the kids working with. Your education is usually about five or six things below what should be.\n\nI mean, they're very smart on computers and phones. You know, we don't have to go to school. We've got all this. I always find it interesting as well, how smart some of the kids are. They know how to like. Start a car and drive a car around, but they don't know how to do their massive work. That's right.\n\nThat's right. They know how to drive a car. They know how to start everything. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's.\n\nSometimes [00:28:00] on a holiday out the station, bit around,\n\nhave a drive and we, I, yeah, traveled all over.\n\nOn the Wall\n\nbook.\n\nI, so anyway, he said Yeah.

It's this thing of privilege too, I think, of [00:38:00] being hired and everyone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just told him about the courthouse and they killed All you see is the courthouse. That's the boat. Yeah. I was fa like my, um, my wife's uh, brother who's been a jackaroo since he was like 16 years old, and.\n\nHe's been on, uh, he's on a sheep um, property in long range. And then now he's off near NDA on a big cattle, cattle property. Oh, but I was looking up the, um, what's his name? Ben, Ben t stuff. He has got a lot of land that far. That's right. Well when that she was saying Ben, I thought for feeding now, but I said, now corn, you sitting over there on the lawn, corn you means poor Aren.\n\nThe road, the lawn, it was, it was nice over there actually like the wind, the breeze is beautiful. [00:39:00] Um, but yeah, it's fascinating to learn about. Yeah, what, what that sort of land can be in the long, long term and yeah. What needs to happen that makes it like sustainable and Yeah. And even the homestead, like you can almost see what it used to look like.\n\nYeah.\n\nThe homestead. Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful. And then walking in and the. Roof caning in and the bats flying around. Yeah. A fixed, yeah. Do you know what the back, there's a back bit and it's got like bars on the window. Do you know what that is or not? Kind like, um, orange, sort of brown bricks. And then there's some bars.\n\nOn the window at the back of the house. I can't remember that then. Yeah, [00:40:00] I know. You should know. I, I was wondering if it was a little case for people in there. No, no, no. It might have been. Who knows?\n\nBluefield.\n\nOh, Harry Bluefield.\n\nYeah, no, I, I took some photos inside the house and then there's, yeah, there's this bit here. That little bit, little bit there. That, that, that might be the meat house. Oh, yeah. Where they kept meat. Yeah.\n\nYeah, but there's no fridges or anything. Then they'd tell no. They kill 'em and hang them in the In the thing. Yeah. But then they could have used something else. I don't know. Yeah.[00:41:00] \n\nYeah, but it's cool. I can, um, yeah, it's an interesting place. Alice Springs. It's, yeah, well there's some good stories around town. I mean, the media puts everything. I mean, it's all over the country. What goes on here? I negativity. Yeah. But other than that, yeah. People say the locals. A lot of visitors still say that it's a beautiful town.\n\nWell, yeah, like you would think from looking at the media, you can't walk down the street at nighttime, but it's just little kids running around. But I mean, ire people are too frightened. Oh, who's on? Oh, she's behind you. I didn't see her. Yeah, no. Media puts a lot of stuff on, but people. And there's some negativity in people that actually don't come from it, but live here now, and they just, oh, but that's what I said to stories.\n\nYeah.[00:42:00] \n\nYeah.\n\nOnce the lights went out midnight, everything was going home and going anywhere until, came after the lights. Yeah. And then. Everybody out.[00:43:00] \n\nYeah. And on the photos,\n\nwhat happened?\n\nYeah. Where do you go?\n\nI was trying to help baby girl walking everywhere. It's interesting, like, um, I've been thinking a lot about. The economy and how much of the economy is driven by, um, the services that are supporting the community. And yeah. Needs to be a bit of like a flip. Flip it. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's so many people that come in and making a lot of money, and I see all of the big trucks that are going out to community, like building things.\n\nAnd, uh, it's almost like money that it's going out the door. It is because I mean, when they take those [00:44:00] demountable doubt to them, commun people that live on there, smash 'em up, it's a waste. Waste of time. Waste of money. Yeah. There's no, but there's no education around.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Kids. Yeah. Better off what's going on. That's what Jason does a lot with the boxing now, gets all the little things. He goes out the communities and everywhere taking his boxes out. Yeah. And he's getting into pig then he. Uh, talks to them, you know the thing. Yeah, yeah. But he, he's been trying to get funding, but no, they're not.\n\nThey gave all this money to the blue and football. Yeah. That's a different funding. Yeah. But still, why, why give it to one thing? Yeah. Give it to the sporting thing. So Jason's dealing with the [00:45:00] sporting stuff, so why do they give half of it some of that money? Yeah. Yeah. It's a really, I spent a lot of my time thinking about the movement of the resource and the money from different places.\n\nAnd the government have very specific, like sentences they say. Yeah. And that sentence defines where that money. And in Queensland it's really bad at the moment. Um, we have a new premier and. He built his campaign around locking kids up. Oh. And he was like, it was pretty tough on his policies. Yeah. He is changing all of the rules and the laws around, um, giving adult sentences to young people.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, but some kids, some kids definitely need some kind of like intervention, but it affects like [00:46:00] a whole bunch of other kids as well and yeah. Yeah, trying to do a lot of different things. And in that isa, 50% of the young people who are getting caught doing crime are from that, and there are very small, there's only population of Alice Springs.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Come sit. It's good. Bit tough out there. Come and sit on the Indy. But, um, Ty and Tanya, you doing some good stuff? Yeah. And, and you are, you are on the board? Yeah. Are you director or Pat as well? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Me, me and, uh, me and, uh, pat, when they need us, they get them and we gotta wear these.\n\nWe bring our shirts. Yep. Yeah. Um, just I'm in office now again. Yep. When they need them. Yep. I, yeah, I've been, I've been blown away by, uh, yeah. [00:47:00] Sit. Christie needs to play. Are you sure how she manages her different identities? Across things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And um, it's complex. I was only thinking the other day because our dad is such an important role model for this whole community.\n\nYeah. And she seems to be the only one out family. Yeah. You. Sort of follow in his footsteps. Mm. Everybody else is working hard. Yeah. But we are silent. Be. Yeah. You know, and what we do. But she, because I'm pushing for, well, she has, she's doing an incredible job. Yeah. And that they, she's definitely the type of person [00:48:00] I wanna see more supported with resource like support.\n\nYeah. Because it, yeah, that, that lack of resource just puts extra pressure and stress on mm-hmm. Because yeah, they've got in, in a NA and I go, I a a, um, there today and I'm hoping that they are able to support term funding like three, three to five years. Is the next that takes that push on us. Mm. Because then, yeah, because I think some of the times too, when, when there's not enough resource, you spend all your time working at how to get resource and not enough time in the program.\n\nUm, yeah, because it's, it's actually going to, Alice Springs is gonna get a lot of, like, seems to be getting a lot of attention. They're having, um, a big youth, um, justice forum period. June. Oh, and then another one in November. Yeah. And then this other thing, you know what I mean? There's a lot of, [00:49:00] so hopefully done.\n\nYeah. Well hopefully it creates sort for the people here though, and not most randoms coming in and, yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, and I, I was, I, I got to go and hang out with, um, some of the young people yesterday and drive around. Jack. I was hanging out with. Yeah, so went and, um, he got a new pair of shoes and, um, and you, you can see just to get a new pair of shoes out, just shatter, you know?\n\nAmazing. Yeah. Yeah, because he, he feet were coming through the bottom wasn't his other ones, so. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But yes, so he's like very, he seems very bright and like very cane. But yeah, just a lot of complex stuff in his house and communities. Yeah, I think once we get that,[00:50:00] \n\nyeah. At least they know they can have a safe sleep at night. Yeah. And, um, yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. We've been, um, making, um, some beds. Are you? Yeah. Oh. So we, um. We, my, um, I've got a business and, um, the person I work with, he started, um, orange Sky. I don't know if you, you've seen Orange Sky? I did. Yeah. So Orange Sky, um, they do, they put washing machines in Vans.\n\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah. And so they've got 50 different locations around Australia. Oh, okay. Yep. So he started that. Um, and then what he, what he was gonna Yeah, but what, what he's, what he's noticed in a lot of community is people's beds never get replaced. Yeah. [00:51:00] And there's lots of like, mold and like, um, disease and things gets through mattresses.\n\nSo there's, we come up with this idea of creating a mattress out of, um, fold down crates. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, um, they're like recyclable cranes. Yeah. You fold them out and then you zip tie them. Oh. And that becomes the base of the bed. Oh. And then you put a bit of foam and a, a couple of, um, mattress toppers.\n\nOh yeah. And that way you can wash all of the mattress topper and the foam, and even just wash the crates. So we've been trying them in, um, there's a hundred of them in Palm Island. Oh, wow. And then a. Kgo and then we we're coming back in about three or four weeks and gonna make a few more in Alice Springs and up Tenet Creek as well.\n\nOh yeah, bloodwood, we got family there. Yeah. And, and we've got, um, we've got a design, a designer in [00:52:00] Darwin who's designing the tops at the moment. Oh yeah, yeah. But yes, it's fun, fun project. Sounds good. Yeah, we just, we just, it's, it's like Santa Cla. You drive around in the car and drop off at people's houses and make a bed and then it's fun.\n\nYeah. Super fun. Yeah. 'cause you know, we got our older from our cousin brothers. Yeah. You know, they just sleep in a drive under a bow ship. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then where the next part of it is. Um, we've noticed a lot of light goods get broken really quickly. Easily. Yeah. Yeah. And so we're trying to create a, a very sturdy washing machine. Well, I did that, that, um, place knowledge. Um. Tap Cat. Yeah, cat made a lot of bush machines. Oh yeah. The center of appropriate technology.\n\nYeah. [00:53:00] Yeah. We've been talking to them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They made all those old, old washing machines and everything from the communities and everything. Yeah. Yeah. We, yeah, we've been talking to them about, um, yeah, how to do that and, 'cause it's a washing machine, isn't that technical? It was only like three working parts.\n\nReally Like a belt and the water and, yeah. So you can make something that's very, very sturdy because grand\n\ngovernment. Yeah.\n\nAnd she made a lot of money outta Really,\n\nshe had her own little laundry.[00:54:00] \n\nSee long way back.\n\nGeorge\n\nstarted to change.\n\nYeah.[00:55:00] \n\nAmerican.\n\nYeah. I was born during the world. Yeah. True. Yeah. Mum used to say when I was a baby now, um, it was just, uh. Three, four days after all after we started. And, uh, and I baby she to reckon when they thought that Japanese was coming down here to bomb Alice Spring. Mm-hmm. She, she carried me and, and Rob and Tony run across the creek over where the golf courses now she reckon they used to have, um.\n\nA road shelters, but [00:56:00] in the dirt and like little ca thing used to run there with us. Now she fence and hide in the, in this tunnel thing. Oh. And when we grew up, they, they were our cubby houses playing in the bank of the creek with all these a road shelters along the bank of the creek on the east side.\n\nThat's not your one that tell, that's not that. Yeah, I came along, I'm the youngest. Mm-hmm. Of everybody. Yeah. Um, but his story is that he went bush working on the station when he was about 16 and when he come back he saw Matthew's hanging on the clothes line. And he said one of the neighbors that used to be friends with had the.\n\nYour sister,\n\nand there's 13 years between Karen and our sister Pat. Wow. Yeah. Wow. [00:57:00] Hectic. And um, and Bob was the same when he, he moved to Melbourne when he came back. He used been, yeah. There's 20 years difference between Yeah.\n\nYeah, so that Always, always the company. Company kid. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Wow.\n\nAs time went on.\n\nAlcu Alcu, yeah, Al because he, he was sent\n\n[00:58:00] months\n\nand.\n\nSo I.\n\nTo send it. Yeah. Yeah. From one wheel track. What was it? Name of the Bush, two wheel tracks to to Richmond Road. Some of, yeah. Cool. Off. Yeah. Dirt Road.[00:59:00] \n\nWow. And when, when we were out at the station, they said there was a old house there, like made of, um, concrete with some old colors loop, like away from the homestead. And there's still like a pole there. That is where the old concrete house used to be isn't in there. The um, Rockwell, yeah. Yeah. On the way to the Rockwell.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That's side Ruby gap. That's, yeah. That's where the um, mission Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. True. So a lot of people have removed [01:00:00] beside the bun and they were taken there. Little Flower Mission. Yeah, little Flower Mission. Then they moved them out. Santare, now they moved it, it was Catholic run. They moved them from there out to Santa Teresa.\n\nSo. Yeah, I actually went to the school last time I was here. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, because I've got that big A FL ground. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a weird place out there. I've never been there. I've got this weird vibe from there. Oh, there. Yeah. Because you drive into town, there's a big cross. Yeah. You, and then you go into the school and it's, you've got the poke there.\n\nVery, yeah. Very. Yeah. They drink, they drink. Well, they drink wine when they go to church. True. Yeah. They all line up. That's where they, that's where they started. Said they learned the, the old priest must have been drunk too. Yeah, the priest. The priest started all that. Yeah. Yeah. [01:01:00] We go out for funerals and stuff like that.\n\nLike it's family obviously, but I don't wanna go out there. 'cause the church, they, or the funerals they have like every prayer I've ever book. Yeah. It's like a mess. It's, they have a mess. It's like they never go for three, three hours, like just in the church. And so we use messages and it's, they'll read every message of just like, yeah, from family and kids and, uh, it's mixed emotion, crying.\n\n\nDJI\\_09\\_20250311\\_112244.WAV\n---\n\nDJI\\_09\\_20250311\\_112244: Board and, and then my dad, will he make fun and no mission? Mission? Santa Teresa used to come into the\n\nschool and.\n\nA lot of them have got [01:02:00] pretty well educated. Those people. They're, yeah, they're very smart people. They've taught by all the,\n\nso that's.\n\nYeah. Not like it was in town. Also, Australia Place got bigger. Yep. And started doing\n\nso. Do you think it was a very obvious change when things started going a bit bit downhill here? Or was it slow? Like sort of, oh, I dunno. I explained that. I mean, when we grew up, everything was good. You know? No one, no one, well, hardly anyone drank, but they're making [01:03:00] up for it now\n\nyou said so he.\n\nBloody bp, what do you doing? And I said, well, I\n\nsaid.\n\nAt the dinner said, oh, you better roll this way. He said,\n\nand when we, we, we all had to sit down at the table. He wasn't allowed to read a book or anything. I mean, he was very strict, but a good father. Yeah. Yeah. No one got a hiding from him. I don't think he. Too short. [01:04:00] Him and my brothers. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. But he was really good. No one was allowed to talk unless he said something.\n\nSo we, we were sort of more brought up that way. But now you've gotta put your hand up. You wanna talk now everybody's talking jumping. True. True that. Yeah. Yeah. No, but we had a good upbringing. Yeah. Really good. Yeah. I mean, we never had much Dad worked. He like, he drove a cab, he cut wood and then he does other jobs, sort of thing like that.\n\nYeah. Kept us going. Well, if we had bread on the table, it's good. And that's the best thing. I, when I went out to station\n\nand we came for a break and started driving truck bp and uh, I said I come backwards until about six months [01:05:00] before.\n\nOn cars and fishing thing up and Mm, he could, he used to go and buy like two or three old Land Rovers and he'd make one good one and he had no, no going down. He teach him, he did all his own. Wow. Yeah, because he old, his old father. He did, he did a lot of stuff on his own too. Yeah. But it, it was his natural, natural talent.\n\nI always say because you like, dad, you done that. You doing all that hard work. With all his life. Yeah, yeah. But you're saying like about the changes to the town? Yeah. You know, um, speaking from my point of view growing up, the only about Aboriginal people who saw was when family came to tell very. Blood [01:06:00] Aboriginal people because they knew this is around the country and they had that still that respect for culture.\n\nMm. You know? Yeah. And before they come through the gap there, they send for dad first, get his permission if they could come in and only one person was allowed to come in. So they sit down where St. Mary's is now. Yes. They just have a camp there and that's, and he'd say, well, yeah, just do your whatever you gotta do and go back.\n\nAnd that's all they did. And a lot of, you know, and a lot of community people knew Yeah. That our family was the main family to lower spring and um, that's what\n\nOh wow.\n\nHe was, I can flip that to you. Yeah. He was a, um, one, yeah.\n\nDad could speak, [01:07:00] um, at least six or seven languages. Wow. With language? Yeah. Really? My mum was in a yard. No, I called you. Oh, did you? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you.\n\nWow. Did um, Tony Babies, they get taken along? No. So they, they bring it out to Creek and Bob. They,\n\nbut because of the policies that, um.\n\nAnd mum was back home in the, with two young boys, babies. And, um, the police come along and said, I'm coming back to get them. And they said [01:08:00] back weren't if they were married, she said you were married.\n\nYou know what means true? He wasn't taking his son, taking place. So dad. Dad took mom to Creek and married her back. Certificate. Policeman come back and Oh, you one of them. Smart. You reckon dad? Yeah.\n\nYeah, the thing is us away going up,\n\ndidn't know what to do with, and so how many siblings? [01:09:00] Like there's 6, 6, 6.\n\nNick. Wow. And there's four of us in our eighties. Wow. And baby turned 60, so I'm 66, baby. Yeah. I. Aboriginal people don't go that in that age group, you know, with all the, see, these are the hardest living British loan ever out. No way. Yeah. So how did that happen? Lots of. In our mother and father's Gene. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And a lot of them say, well, I said, well, you just drink that river water from the Tide River. You're right. Oh, that's alone. Because I mean, we used to get our water supply from the Tide underground, but then if you salty, see? Yeah. But then they shifted it out, out to, um, Marini [01:10:00] out this way. But I think we get it from out there now at the water.\n\nWater, water supply. And Alice Springs has got the second best water supply in, in the world. Mm. Really? Towards Tasmania. Oh, I reckon our water is just as a basin. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's fascinating. Yeah. And um, since I've been talking to Kristy and Tanya, they talk about the two worlds thing. What's your sort of.\n\nConcept of that. Like what, how do you think about that? Like this whole idea of two worlds? Like is that with, for the kids, you think in terms of like trying to understand culture and understand why? Yeah. Yeah. I reckon it's harder for the kids now. I mean, when we grew up, we knew, we grew up with two worlds Aboriginal and.\n\nUh, Europeans. Yeah. But it, well, because we went to school, but the kids nowadays, I [01:11:00] mean, they say they've got culture. The younger kids haven't got any culture now. They, you can, they're too much on Facebook with TikTok and all that, all this westernized stuff, you know? Mm. And none of them, they're all walking around the gangs, you know, they've got gangs.\n\nI mean that lack of respect. Yeah. For elder people here, most of these kids don't have role models. Nothing. Responsible. Adult living at home, we always say, yeah, if the town was built in their country, we'd be out bush, they'd be in town. Yeah. If, forgetting that this is somebody's traditional country Yeah.\n\nMm. Yeah.\n\nThe best kid. Yeah. The government.\n\n[01:12:00] Yeah.\n\nBut I mean, we got on with. We got on with white kids north. Mm. Some of our best friends and still ha, still are our best friends to this stage that we grew up with, went to school with. Yeah. Makes you wonder what that layer of like disconnection is between Yeah. Like the community and others. I thought it's manufactured through other things, right?\n\nYes. A lot of these young, young ones that come in from the communities, they think they own the town and they don't even, you know, they don't belong here, but they think they can do anything in the town around the country. Yeah. They wasn't taught by, well, they never took no to the elder. When is, when are you going?\n\nUm, I'm going back to Brisbane this afternoon. Oh. But then I'm back. Um. [01:13:00] On the 1st of April. Mm-hmm. I'm actually coming for the Saturday and Sunday for the the doctor. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause I'm going to tan. I'm actually going to Spain. Oh. Are for two weeks. Oh. Which is pretty weird. Um, I'm going to actually going Spain then Athens than London, than spine then.\n\nOh, you doing a Katrina trip? It's actually a. He's got a plan. I didn't know. She just jumped on and went. Yeah. It's actually, I'm, I, I'm really fascinated with the Spanish Youth Justice system. Oh yeah. They actually do a really good job of, um, teaching and connecting kids. Can you talk to Christie? Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nI'm, I'm planning a trip with them to come, um, oh, because they, Taylor's got kids. I don't have any kids. Okay. You come. Okay. Okay. Chris's got dogs. You,[01:14:00] \n\num, and then, yeah, then I'm going to Athens. Um. To, um, so they're doing a global washing alliance. Yeah. Ah, there's a lot of world people that, um, do a lot of things around. Like washing's a very big thing for community, for health. Yeah. And so there's this man that he, um, makes. Hand washing machines and gives them to people around India.\n\nUm, so we're going to Athens there and then going to London, um, where they have, um, an organic farm where people with a disability run the farm. Oh yeah. Gotta go, go check out. Because I'm really interested in like community grassroots to people. Um, yeah. And.\n\nYeah. And to get people involved do sort things. Yeah. In their lives. It was like, just like last week I went into Y and there was about four old, old Stockman Aboriginal down at the [01:15:00] door there, and I, me and. Granddaughter crossed over. Yep. And one was dressed in his cowboy a bit like they, they still dressed like that and sitting, I don't know what we standing around here for.\n\nWe should be at mar and cattle and I feel really sorry for I poor thing, you know, because that was their life. That was their life. And, and he reckon, what are we standing around here for? You know, watching everyone go into the shop. Yeah. And I, I thought, oh, poor, I thinking he was dressed his cowboy boots and everything.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So that, and that's the only time\n\nwhen they get paid from the station. Yeah. They get their brand new hat. Right. Get them belts and everything come. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But you know, there's just a few that are still around that still wear them clothes, you know, still dress up nice and clean and tidy. Yeah. When you say that, I really sorry for you, I was [01:16:00] thinking therefore I'm from du, there's a lot of work.\n\nWork ethic that comes from living on the land. Yeah. Yeah. Looking after animals. Yeah. My, my wife's brothers, she used to be a horse rider. Oh yeah? Yeah. We all rode, I rode horses, he rode horses. We had donkeys and had camels and everything. We rode when, when he So cool. Yeah. When Henry was managing the station, his small, so we'd be in town then I'd load the car up and foot flat.\n\nOn a Friday night after basketball. Yeah. All the kids on the back. True. Yeah. Yeah. My, um, wife's brother, he lives on a property and all of his kids do rodeo. Oh. And they travel all around Australia. Oh. And two, two of the young ones are both Australian rodeo champions. Oh, really? And one of them, one of them lives in, um, Las Vegas now, and is a world champion.[01:17:00] \n\nWhat's his name? Uh, Dustin Root. Is one's name and then w um, Wiley Roots is the other one. Oh, neat. And they, they actually, um, they're the ones you circuit it up. Yeah. They actually take the, the smaller, um, potty carves. Yeah. Yeah. They run those, they've got a big semi trailer. Yeah. They, they have a, um, they're on the station out the war.\n\nOh. But yeah, they pretty much, they drive like 2000 kilometers just to go to one way and.\n\nI love watching radio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a really like, um, positive community. Yeah. Sharing of like life thing, right? As you said, like it's people almost like being welcomed into one place and doing it properly. That's on the Really, yes. They're coming up. And [01:18:00] put asked if they wanted to get on. I jumped.\n\nDad, anything you, if it was free for all, anybody could ride if they wanted to. Broco only.\n\nAt Dock. Yeah. They don get on. I remember that the donkey rides at the radio. They used to take donkeys and get Yeah. Up dinner. All the different places people a money.\n\nYeah. The rodeo brings Right. And white together. Yeah. Yeah. Because they got that history, you know? Yeah. I used to be up in Doomadgee though. Used to love the rodeo up, up there [01:19:00] and then Mount Isa. Of course. Yeah. Massive rodeo. Well, I was always going to Mount Isa, but I never got there for a rodeo. Yep. Oh really?\n\nWell, history, now I'm be, I was me. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nOh, that's what I did. Two years straight. Oh, kids up. It's actually quite hard to get to Mount is 'cause there's no flight. No, they drive. They drive. No one flies anywhere here. You drive everywhere. Yeah.\n\nIt was the end.\n\nThere all the roads up to there stopped right there. But we used to go Mount Island. Mm. Good to look around there. To see coming this far.

      "Transcript": "Do you want Team Horizon? Nah, one each. That's alright. That's alright. Easy. Team Horizon. How you been? Yeah, good. Busy. New gigs good? It's awesome. I freaking love it. Much better? It's just such a different culture. Okay. You still here? Nice, yeah. In the other building? In the network site upstairs with the engineers. Okay. Yeah, my team are so lovely and they're so people focused. That's good. Breath of fresh air for you? Yeah. Being in a very nice people focused area. Righto brother. So just your name and if you can spell it, that'd be awesome for me. Spell? Yeah, okay. Paul Gordon. P-A-U-L. G-O-D. P-A-U-L. G-O-R-D-O-N. Awesome. Tell us a little bit about your role at Horizon. How long you been in this area? Yeah, sure. I've been working for Horizon for 10 years now. Various locations around the country. Brisbane, Toowoomba and now Mackay. And I look after a maintenance contract for an external company that we provide maintenance services for. Cool. How did you first hear about RSCO? Well, the Horizon head office is there. Yeah. Well, I was here not too far down the road and Horizon is one of the signature sponsors of Orange Sky. I started volunteering here on a Wednesday morning and the concept's just fantastic. Bringing those sort of simple services to people connects them also to then a range of other services and just gives them that sense of belonging and it's very aligned to our company values and hence wanted to be involved. Cool. That's cool man. Can you tell me a bit about those aligning values and how that sort of fits with how you came to be supporting Arizona? Sure. Arizon is very much focused on giving back to the community in which we operate. As Australia's largest rail freight organisation, we are located all around the country. It's a very inclusive culture, a culture based on ensuring that we deliver excellence in everything we do. Included within that is making sure that we support the communities that we operate. That's cool. Do you get a chance to come to ship very often? How do you feel when you come to our ship? Yeah. So now we've started a barbecue trailer down in Serena. Serena is about 30km south of here in Mackay. There's a pod down there also. And we wanted to bring that food service offering to the Orange Sky pod down there. So we asked our apprentices down at the maintenance facility to build a purpose built trailer as one of their projects, which they did. And in classic engineering and Arizon form, we went all out. And it's a really nifty looking trailer. So now on a Monday, we get the loco depot, the wagon depot, the transformation team, the overhaul facility and my team on an eight week rotating roster. And we head down there and cook sausages, onions and provide it to the friends of Orange Sky in the hope that food brings them in to then connect them to the services that they may need from time to time. That's cool. I'm really obsessed with this. I'm really obsessed with this idea of partnership recently. What do you think represents a partnership between you and Orange Sky in totality, not just financial or other things? What does a partnership mean to you? Sure. Well, beyond the financial support that we provide, a lot of Arizon staff, myself included, provide that volunteering support as well. That's quite important because of that core principle of making sure that we... support the communities in which we operate. So we're donating both time and dollars. That's cool, man. So Orange Sky is about washing, conversation, connection, all these types of things. Is there something that stands out for you that... Like if you talk about impact, what do you think the impact is that's supporting the community here? The mixture of things, the people that can plan for a single one or what do you think? I think what's changed my perspective around the definition of homelessness or what that classical view of someone living on the streets is that's shifted quite a lot. Has been my experience. Cost of living crisis is real. Often it doesn't take much to be on that knife edge between everything's okay to all of a sudden you're living out of your car. In a place like Mackay, you know, with vacancy rates at less than 1%, my own view of what it is to be homeless has shifted quite fundamentally. And then also it's just that social connection. There are people that come down to use the services and to have a nice sausage sizzle for no other reason but to connect with other human beings, which I think is a wonderful concept in and of itself. That's cool, man. Do you think there's a vision that Horizon has of what Orange Sky should be growing or focusing on in the future? Or is it kind of like you trust them, you just go with it? Or are there different ways in which you as an organisation would like Orange Sky to grow, I guess, in Australia and maybe around the world? Yeah, I think there's probably other people in our organisation that could comment on that. But the concept's quite simple and powerful. Because of that simplicity, I don't think we're in a position to provide that guidance beyond the support that we do in various parts of the country that we operate. That's cool, man. It's always one of those things, I think people have this dream, Orange Sky can be everything, but the simplicity is sometimes where the power is. Down in Serena, for example, Lisa's doing some work with a local bank. There's an unused sort of toilet block down there. And she's wanting to come in. And she's wanting to convert that into a shower and a toilet. So when you think of you've got shower, toilet, laundry services and food, that's kind of like the golden triangle of providing that dignity of service. So there's things like that, obviously, that we can support when it makes sense to do so. But I think the fundamental principle is very sound. And so I suppose since not knowing who Orange Sky is, to being a supporter and stuff, personally, what's next for you in terms of your appreciation? Yeah. And your appreciation or engagement with whether it's Orange Sky homelessness or social issues? Do you have a particular vision or something you'd like to do? Yeah, sure. Well, we've just kicked off this barbecue trailer down in Serena there. We're eight weeks into launching that service. So for the next couple of months, we just want to really make sure we bed that down and create that consistency of service so that we can create that awareness for those people in need. I haven't really thought beyond that. Cool. Is there anything you reckon I didn't touch on that you think you should from an Horizon perspective or anything you'd like to say that's like specific that wasn't captured or? No, I think we wear orange all day and Orange Sky is an orange brand and that's a match made in heaven. Wait, did you plan that or was that just something that came up? No, I saw Ashley in the background. Thanks, brother. Thanks, mate. Well done. I'll just take a quick photo. You actually do? That's all right. Yeah.\n",

Why can't I have a picture? You can in a minute, I reckon. We can do that. It's always about the kids. I'd rather you do it than me. I hate talking on camera. Just talk to me. Don't worry about the camera. All right, Rad, do you want Sunny's on or off? It's up to you. I'd rather him on. Is that annoying or does it look crap?

So it's R-I-double-K-I and then it's D-O-W-N-M-A-N. Cool. So I'm going to ask you the same question I just asked you. How long have you been working at Orange Sky and how did you first hear about it? Orange Sky probably for around six weeks or so, so I'm relatively new. I actually, I'd heard about them for a while. However, I did see a post on Facebook from a local counsellor saying that the service is at a point where they're desperately needing volunteers and that it would possibly be shut down if they didn't get some more volunteers for the service. And I thought, right, now's the time to jump on board. I don't want it to be shut down because I think it's a great service. So within a day or so, I'll be able to get some more volunteers. Okay. So within a day or so, I'd already signed up. So yeah, within a week I was here. Yep. Cool. What was the compulsion do you think and why do you think, like what's your philosophy and why it's important I guess for this community especially? I think the community desperately needs something like this. I think that there is a stigma about, you know, like coming to something like this, being in the community, you know, being in the community and being in the community and being in the community. And so there's a stigma about the fact that we are in the public eye and admitting that you might need a bit of help. However, I think with the help of the local like NDIS and council and things like that. Sorry. Blakey, can you sit over there? Quick. He's recording at the moment. I'll come and take a photo in a minute. Quick, quick, sorry. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. So I think that the, you know, it's a bit of a... Yeah. I think that the, you know, we've had some meetings since I've been on board with the local NDIS and they're talking about bringing their clients down themselves just to, I guess, so they don't feel so ashamed or that they're not coming by themselves, you know. Totally. What's the area like, I suppose, in general? Like do you feel... Do people talk about people struggling with their clients? Yeah. Yeah. Do you feel like there's a lot of people struggling around here often? Is it something that's kind of... Yeah. ...public eye and thought about a lot? I do think like there is, I know that there's a lot of housing, you know, community housing and stuff around here. So there is a few, I'm not sure on the stats, but there is probably quite a few unemployed and people from different backgrounds. And like I said, quite a bit of housing in this area. But I think that's a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. So I definitely think there's a community of people that would utilise it. It just needs to be promoted maybe a little bit more or... Yeah. What's the... What do you think the most important part of the service is? Do you think there's a specific part? Is it washing, conversations, connection? Yeah. Or is it like a combination of all the pieces? Well, I mean, one of the reasons why I joined is I feel like I have a bit of a knack for just... I have a bit of a knack for talking to people. You know, like I feel like I can talk to anyone from different backgrounds. So I feel like for me, that was going to be the easiest part is just to get people in. You know, like if I can tell you a quick story, there was a gentleman who was walking along this path just last week and you could see that he was sort of... He kept looking over, but he didn't really want to come over. And I feel like if it wasn't for me walking up to him, just asking how his day was, how he's going, within a few minutes he was here having a feed because there's another service provider here providing like a bit of a breakfast. So he had something to eat. We had a chat. He was telling me about how he's living out of one of the toilets and that he's living in a house. Yeah. And he was just desperate for some food. And I think the conversation itself was good for him because he just wanted someone to chat to. He got some information about local services he can use or utilise. He actually had a toothache at the time and he was like, you know, how do I deal with this? And, you know, we referred him to the hospital and, you know, it was just a... It was... It was... It was just that... Just that... Him walking past and me approaching him. Yeah. I don't believe if I hadn't have gone up to him, then he wouldn't have come over here. So, yeah. What do you think happens over time as friends continue to come? Like, do you feel like there might be a change the more often they come and the more connected they are? Like, is there an impact in that way as well? Like, the longer they come, the more... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As friends, the longer they come, the better they can possibly feel or their general sense of wellbeing can possibly increase. Yeah, absolutely. I mean I haven't been here long enough to know those sorts of things and what the long term impacts are, but I can see that just having conversations with people and providing that service for people, it's helping them out. Yeah. heard stories of some of the other volunteers here that were struggling and just wanted to give back so now they're volunteering so it's sort of that you know cycle that yeah. Yeah so interesting what's the best part of your sort of experience in this whole thing like as certain parts that you like more than others and are there things that you take away from every shift feeling a particular way? I just feel like I'm giving back a little bit to the community and at a time when they desperately needed it and now I feel like it's I've taken on board the I need to now search for more volunteers myself and I've already started the conversations with a lot of people who weren't even aware of what Orange Sky was or what they did and I've just had that conversation just this afternoon with someone somebody at the my son's school you know and they're like well what is Orange Sky why are you wearing that t-shirt you know like the brightest person walking around the school so yeah it's just that in itself getting the word out there it's been great yeah. Awesome and what's do you have a style in which you engage people with Orange Sky and tell them why it's awesome like is there something that you say that's in relation to why they should volunteer like if someone else. I just like I said I just love having chats with people you know so if nothing else you know some people don't even want to get anything washed but they're walking past and I just love how you going how you been you know what's what are you up to today you know I just love that interaction and for someone who is also a mother who's been through the same things as me and I just feel like that's just a part of life. And I don't often you know you you suck doing mum duties at home and not having that adult conversation it's good to get out and have a chat to people. Cool I reckon that's it yeah unless you had anything else specific. No no I'm good I think I've spoken enough did I.\n",

      "Transcript": "**Jesus Interview**\n\nPart 1:\n\nHere's the English translation:\n\n**José, you have to speak to him. Don't you use the microphone?**\nNo.\n**I thought you had one.**\nOne by one?\n**Yes, microphone.**\nOne by one?\n**Yes, one by one. Yes, good. A little bit like this.**\nI want the chair in it. I want the chair in it.\n**You want the chair?**\nYeah.\n**What?**\nThe bench.\nAh, today no. Ah, good. I've got the same socks, man. And I didn’t wear them. What a shame! Next time. Next time, yes. Alright.\n**Just his name and his job.**\nYour name and your job? Your name and what you do?\nI'm Jesús Teruel, from Fundación Diagrama. I'm the territorial director for Murcia. So, I coordinate the youth reform and protection centers and integration programs here in Murcia, all working with young people.\n**Could you spell out your full name, please?**\nJ E S U S T E R U E L. Jesús Teruel.\n**And I guess how long you've worked here, why you started working here, and your philosophy.**\nI was a volunteer during high school and university. I worked in my hometown, Alcantarilla, with youth who had special needs and vulnerable youth who didn't attend school. That's how I met Fundación Diagrama’s president.\n**How many years ago was that?**\nThat was around '88-'89. In 1992, Diagrama was officially founded. In '91, we started working at the first center opened by Fundación Diagrama, which is this one, La Zarza, opened in '92. José, the current director, started then as well, so he’s been part of this history from the beginning, specifically at this center. As a coordinator, I started in '92 as the director of this center, then moved to Andalucía, to Aljaraque, Ciudad Real, Madrid, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, also to Ourense, opening several centers for Fundación Diagrama. Then in 2000, I returned to Murcia. We began operating under the new law (5/2000), effective January 13, 2001—the law we currently use. Essentially, my entire professional life has revolved around working with young people and Fundación Diagrama. I studied pedagogy. That's roughly my professional history.\n**And why do you enjoy working in this sector?**\nInitially, it was about becoming aware of the needs of the most vulnerable. From there, I began working in my neighborhood, my local parish, running youth workshops, providing alternatives to just hanging around on the streets. That's where my vocation originated. My entire career path has been about this. It's not an easy path, though. It's tough—there are many rewarding moments, but it’s filled with challenges, demands, and commitments, both personal and family-related. Your family needs to understand because even though things are now better organized and structured, the nature of the job requires 24/7 availability, every day of the year. Your family can't always bear the burden of your professional choices; you must also commit to your own family, your spouse, your children. It's a balancing act, which I suppose applies to all professions with a vocational aspect. We've worked hard to professionalize this field, but without a vocational element, it's impossible. Everyone—from the cook to the center’s director, the technical staff, and educators—needs to genuinely care about these young people and want to help them. If not, this isn't the right place.\n**I'd love to hear about the growth of Diagrama, how difficult it was, what you personally invested, and why you're still here, why this still matters.**\nIt’s challenging because day-to-day work brings happiness, satisfaction, and keeps you going. I'm not someone who constantly stops to justify or reflect on everything—I operate more instinctively. The difficulty during Diagrama’s growth was consistently communicating that young people are at the heart of our work and that our purpose is genuinely helping them. One problem was, as Diagrama expanded beyond Murcia into other regions, it became challenging for everyone to work and think exactly the same way. That was initially a goal of mine, but I've let go of that because each center has its own character and particularities. Each director has their personality. But the common goal—working with young people—remains essential.\nSome directors are more dynamic, more affectionate with the kids; others express affection differently. Everyone shows their care, responsibility, and closeness differently. I’m very tactile—hugging, kissing, affectionate—but I can’t impose this style on everyone. Still, it's essential the young person feels we're genuinely here to help. That doesn’t mean giving them everything they want—we don't indulge whims.\nWe constantly walk a fine line. To some in society, we're jailers who restrict rights and punish young people. I’m astonished when I hear that. Yet, we receive regular visits from prosecutors, judges, and the administration, so I'm at ease. Our center remains transparent. On the other hand, some say the kids here do whatever they want, go on excursions, to the cinema, and have sports activities—living better than anyone else. These extremes have been the most challenging part. Even among my own friends, some criticize us for being harsh, others say we're like a hotel. That's difficult.\nSometimes I openly discuss this; other times I say, “I'm just going to keep doing my job as best I can,” like all who work in this field. The emotional involvement is inevitable, making this work demanding. It requires maturity and personal growth to face these realities.\nWhy am I still here? The good thing is, I never ask myself this, which means I'm content. If I constantly questioned it, I'd fall into depression or lose my motivation. Occasionally, someone asks why I'm still here, and I respond that this is genuinely what I've always done, what fulfills me, despite the numerous personal, familial, and relational challenges.\n**I hope I've answered your questions clearly. Did you have any doubts left? Please let me know so we can interact and clarify them better. Any more questions?**\nI think because he touched on many cultures. I was interested in Diagrama’s cultural aspects. I'm going to wrap up now; the judge is here. But I think you've answered most of it. One question I had was about Diagrama’s culture—in terms of how people… I'm going to wrap up since the judge is here. But you've answered most of those questions. The one thing I'm very interested in… If not, come here, we'll introduce you to David, and we'll introduce him. I'm interested in… Why do you think that…? One second. Come here, let me introduce you.\n\n\nPart 2:\n\nYes, you can walk around, you can record everything—no young people’s faces, as usual—but feel free to move around, there's no issue. You'll notice all the interactions with young people in Australia. I'd like to explore this concept: What would it be like if you hadn't come to Australia to witness this? How would he approach explaining to people why this relational interaction with young people is essential, something we don't fully grasp in Australia? Every time he visits, he's struck by the contrast, by how Australia doesn't quite understand. How would you explain its importance—the good relationships and closeness you must have with young people working in this sector?\nIt’s difficult, really challenging. But I'd make a parallel with professionals who are parents—being a youth worker is a profession, you receive a salary, but it's also a calling. Raising awareness or sensitizing people to this need comes from understanding that the young person fulfilling a judicial sentence or facing vulnerability is someone who genuinely needs help. I believe we should all consider giving them a second chance, helping them reintegrate into society.\nSo, making a parallel with parenthood—every parent understands how tough adolescence is, staying alert, losing sleep worrying whether their child will return home safely. Young people require very personalized attention and an understanding of their circumstances. I say understanding, not justifying. Because young people serving a judicial sentence first need to clearly grasp that they’re accountable for their actions. They're here right now as an opportunity, but they're serving a sentence—a measure. But if the approach is solely punitive and disciplinary, we won't achieve any real change.\nIf I want my adolescent child to successfully navigate adolescence, overcome difficulties, and grow into a responsible adult who cares for others, expresses emotions healthily, and holds helpful values, I must transfer these principles to our work in the centers. We aren't jailers; we're not just enforcing a sentence to pass the months until they leave. We're here to work with them, to transmit values, to show them there's a different way to respond to situations. And for us, as adults and professionals, being there with them during this process is crucial.\nOne of our goals—and some may criticize this—is for the young person to be happy here. Because being happy, feeling good, allows them to change and absorb new concepts and ways of expressing their emotions. There are young people who arrive bursting with anger, and you think, well, we all feel anger. The difference is we've learned to channel it. Let's try to teach them that, right?\nIt's not an easy job, but the real satisfaction comes when, years later, you encounter a young person who spent time here, who recognizes you, greets you warmly, remembers your name, and embraces you. It makes you realize, \"Wow, we’re supporting acceptance, difference, teaching responsibility, and helping them find their place.\"\nAlright, everything's good. Thanks very much.\n",

And you were telling me about washing it before. How do you wash the mattress? Oh, I just hand wash. And why do you hand wash?\nWhat's that about? I just love it. [00:01:00] I'm a silly lad. Tell us what do you reckon other people should get in this mattress and why? For one, it's good for when you need outdoor spaces. It's good for outdoor. Oh, even like you said, you can Make it into a bed. You can even turn it into a table. Even like you said, so I've done it myself.\nYeah, and it works. Comes from an Aboriginal person, it works. Yeah. Yeah, that's super interesting. Why do you think it works from an Aboriginal perspective? What's that, what, why, can you explain a bit more? Oh for me, I no longer like to just lay around anywhere and lay around anyhow. So for me, I can just take it here and there.\nJust to get out and walk about. Even just going down a little bit. Down the corner, of my yard, just laying down in there. What would your message be to other communities about the beds? If they were thinking about using them, but not sure, what would you say to other people about trying it out?\nTry it. Try it. You won't regret it, I tell you. You won't regret it, trust me. If I can do it, you can. And how do you reckon, so we've got to [00:02:00] make 100 beds this weekend, how do you think we best Work with the community and support the families and stuff doing it. What's our best way to do that? Mate, like you got it here.\nIt's just for you like, you can also Like maybe put something up like a, to a little business note to let people know when you're coming over and when you're going So, you'll have more people ready for you the next time you come over You see, like me, I was looking for you straight away when I saw you.\nI just came straight back. It was pretty exciting when we came and you just set it up straight away. And I remember, I think you saw Nick at the barge. Do you remember what you said to him? Yeah, we were supposed to have this interview, yeah. But I couldn't go out, I didn't catch you. You were supposed to be at the the ranger's station.\nBut you weren't there. Do you remember what you said to Nick? Nah, he just asked me if we can go like this. How did you like that? What you call, we came and saw you, but you went down. I said, oh, you, sorry. But what did you say to him when he when he said, do you do [00:03:00] like it? I said him, I was good.\nYeah. And then he said, will just come see you and so you can, gimme a better point of view and have a little recording. So like this, but I couldn't find you. And what do you think we should do in the future with the beds? Like how, what do you, what would you like to see in the future for the beds?\nI don't know, probably pee with my blanket. Bigger or smaller. Yeah. But I prefer smaller. Yeah. Single size bed, yeah. Okay, cool. And there's one more little message about the beds. What would you say to someone who was not sure about it? One last time. If they were not sure about getting a bed, what would you say to them?\nOh, I would say, yeah, get it. For sure, brother, yeah. If people have ideas like this, usually wouldn't have been here any, but doing this, That's a good idea. I reckon many people should be able to do it. Just try it. Please, just try it. You won't get it. Hehe.\nI get it wrong.\n",

      "Transcript": "Why not? That's good. So if you just see your name and spell it, you just talk straight... Oh, actually, if you click that, like, here, if that makes sense? Oh, actually, click it the other way. Yeah. Put this inside. Yeah. Under your shirt. It doesn't mind. So put this on the outside. Yeah, that on the outside and that in your shirt. Gotcha. All right. Put that behind your shirt, so you're even hiding that thing. Right. So, I've got it. Yeah, boom. That's it. Ah, gotcha. Right. Have nothing. Good work. Good work. I look like I'm greenling. Full natural. Hide the tech. Yeah, full natural. Hide all the tech. Doesn't get any more natural than this. Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. All right. First of all, just do your name and spell it, so we know what your name is and we can spell it. My name's Samantha Brust. B-R-E-U-S-T. Cool. Samantha, tell me a tiny bit about yourself, so people know who you are, I guess. So, I got involved in a... Oh, yeah. I got involved in Orange Sky when I was working for a company called Connect, and I was the general manager of that company, and we were looking for a social cause that we could link with. And literally, the reason was that our logo was orange, and so was Orange Sky. And QBE Insurance was the sponsor at the time, so we were also partnered with them, and it was a really good opportunity, and it was very popular. The Sudsy Challenge in particular went really well with Connect, but I started personally volunteering myself. And after I'd done a couple of things... I'd done a couple of weeks of volunteering, I said to my husband, you should come down. And he was like, oh, I don't know if it's my jam. I'm an allied health professional, and so I work in a space where helping people who've got vulnerabilities is pretty common in my world, but he's an engineer. And anyway, that's ended up being a match made in heaven, and we both volunteer every fortnight now and love that. And yeah, Nick does hoses and washing machines and stuff like that, and chats to everyone about rugby, and I just do the washing and folding part. So yeah, it's great. We love it. It's cool. And yeah, good yarn with AJ. What's it like working with AJ, who's experienced it, then come during sports bowling? Yeah, it's great. I mean, AJ is just awesome. He's a great human, and he's really helped, I guess, to create a connection where he knows people. A lot of the faces that we might not see all the time, he'll know from around the streets himself. And the fact that he was a friend back in the day, he's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. And he's a great guy. And that he's been able to really turn his whole life around, and he's done it through the dedication of volunteering. Orange Sky is only one of the organisations he volunteers for. He effectively makes a career of that now. And yeah, he's just a great guy, and someone that I might not normally have much of an opportunity to get to know. And that's one of the great things about Orange Sky that I really like, is that you're working with people from all sorts of different walks of life and things that they do. So yeah. That's so great. I mean, I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I mean, I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. I think that's the best thing about Orange Sky. Or just like what I'm used to… But what's that mean to you, er as a person? Well, I think friendship, is, kind of, I guess just the, for a lot of people, blend into my personality. Interesting. Thank you. Well, sharing that experience with us on the motel room… fulfill us. Thank you. …I really enjoy that. Thank you! Sounds as though you want to come back and have a drink with me next time. True that. And if I do! I would love to entertain my two friends! I would love that! But for me, it's probably homey because I and Orange Sky have been putting in so much What's that mean to you in terms of like, not just what our Skype is, but what does friendship mean to you? And so how does that support you as well as a person? I think friendship is kind of the, I guess the base of what brings connection to humans. And I think no matter, maybe, you know, COVID kind of showed us as a population that, you know, friendship or connectivity with other humans is so vital to survival. And actually all the other trappings, you know, are almost inconsequential if you don't have social connections. So friendship, yeah, I'm very lucky that I have a friendship network that I know when times are tough will support me, but also people to enjoy fun times with. And actually you do see that on the streets as well. The friends really do engage with each other and support each other. And I think that's been my greatest learning through doing the volunteering, is that there's actually a really respectful code generally on the street. And I think that's a really good thing because you can see the streets between individuals, and they do look after each other. And I love how if you are a volunteer with Orange Sky, you're just embraced into that. So, you know, often in everyday life now, I'll come across people. I work in the, I worked in the city for a little while recently, and I now run a set of medical practices and we have a clinic in town. And, you know, so I'll be walking around and I'll see friends that I know from the weekend and they'll often not recognise me initially and they'll say, oh, you look really familiar. And I'll be like, yeah, I work for Orange Sky. And they're like, oh yeah, okay, yeah. So I love that it gives instant connectivity. It's really special. That connection piece has always been really strong. Like it's in the, like that sort of catchphrase is from the beginning. What's your perception as like, just sort of adding onto that, of how does Orange Sky, what's Orange Sky's part of that connection process as part of the broader ecosystem with homelessness or wellbeing or whatever? Yeah, I think it's such a safe space, Orange Sky. You know, it's one of the, there's no competition around it. It's basically, you know, even when you're working to get things that you need to survive, food and shelter, those sorts of things, I guess it sets up a little bit of a competition kind of feeling amongst people that can be a bit fractious. But Orange Sky doesn't have any of that. It's just really gorgeous that people can come, sit, relax. They have to wait. They have to be there to get their clothes back again. So it's the only service that is offered around here that has that kind of element where you have to be there for an extended period of time. And so as a result of that, the conversations can develop very naturally rather than when you're in a queue waiting for a commodity, it's a bit more difficult to have that natural conversation develop. So I think that connectivity is really sponsored by the way Orange Sky goes about its business. And I love that we see, yeah, I think it's so important to see the same people every two weeks when we volunteer every fortnight. And I love that it's the same people and they literally come and seek you out just to say hi, even if they're not having their washing done, which is cool. So great. Like volunteering is a quite a common occurrence, but Orange Sky has like a different form of volunteering in a way in which there's a lot of like interaction. Most of it is like talking and connecting and stuff. Some people might be on the fence around volunteering because of that interactive part. What would you say about people that might be on the fence because they're not sure about, you know, they're not sure about that connection piece or like what's been like advantageous for you in volunteering as part of it? Yeah, look, I mean, people are people. And I think that the example of Mick and I, and no doubt you'll meet Mick sometime soon, but you know, Mick's natural space is not in this kind of environment where you're speaking to people that you don't know about all sorts of things. Whereas I think that came a little more easily. That part was what drew me to that. But people have the same fundamental interests and desires. We all talk about whatever's interesting to us. We talk about movies, we talk about books, we talk about sport and we talk about life in general. And it's really, some of the really deep and connected conversations that I've had at Orange Sky have been, you know, out of nothing, just out of sitting next to someone and sharing a moment more than anything. And what I've always found really interesting about that is, I think, that's what I've always found really interesting about that is, how people really appreciate small things in life, even though they have nothing. And it really actually reminds me to have some gratitude sometimes because, you know, these people are often in extraordinarily difficult circumstances and that they still, you know, there's always pleases and thank yous and they're always so grateful for the tiny little bit we give, comparative to the hardship that they encounter. And I really love, I really love that part about it. That's what makes us come when it's raining and a bit miserable. I'm going to leverage your awesome yarns here and ramp it up a notch and ask you a more tough question maybe. So Orange Sky's coming to 10 years. What do you reckon Orange Sky's next trajectory is? Like, I think some charities get big and then they get dry and they just get more money but don't have as much impact. What do you think will help Orange Sky continue to have impact? Even though it's like an old hat in the game, I guess. Well, you know, this is a little bit left of centre, but, you know, in the position where at work, I'm looking for opportunities to be engaged with things that have an environmental, sustainable, that ESG component of running a small business, like I do, is actually really complex for companies. So I think linking together that kind of cause no harm to the world and only do good piece is a really big opportunity for Orange Sky. And when I think about it from a sponsorship or... Hey, Gerry, how are you? I'm fine, yeah. Look at Gerry's feet. Come here and have a look. This is Gerry. Hey, Gerry, what's going on? He's got the best beanie in the world on today and his head's probably lots warmer than mine. What's happening today, Gerry? You're waiting for your... You know what I'm like? It's raining. You're waiting for your clothes, aren't you? Yeah, of course. Gerry's load is in drying with Orange Sky at the moment. Oh, cool. Yeah, so Gerry's one of our regular visitors. This gentleman's recording some footage for Orange Sky. Orange Sky. Are you happy to be on Orange Sky video? You've got me regular. I guess the guy was in your shoes. Oh, were you a volunteer once? Yeah. Were you? For Orange Sky? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. So Gerry regularly visits us. Yeah, I usually come... And it's always good for a chat, aren't you? I usually go to Goldmoor. Yeah. With AJ. Yeah. But now it's closed, so I come here. So Gerry and AJ go way back, don't you? Is Goswell's closed? Closed? Is Goswell's closed? So that's why you come back here? It's for the holidays. Oh, for the school holidays. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I get that. That's cool. Yeah. Do you reckon we could swap out and we could have a yarn... Of course. ...one-on-one? Absolutely. You happy to have a yarn with me? Yeah. Can we put the mic?\n",

      "Transcript": "Oh, why is that? Alright. You're not going to be behaving like that, are you? No. I probably will, because I'm like real thing with my... when I get nervous, sorry. That's okay. Just make sure you're in focus. Sorry, do you want a seat or something? We've got a seat in the back of the car. I think it's fine. Bend your knee. Don't use your back as a crane. That's a good tip, actually. Alright, so just your name and spell it. Oh, no, you don't need to spell it. I know your name. Just your name and... I guess I used to say it. Yeah, your name, where you work, and just a little bit about... Yeah, what you're working. So, my name is Jo Kingey. I am the CNC for Healthy Skin. I've been with Queensland Health in North West for the last year. And before this role, I was the nurse navigator for RHD. Cool. Tell us a little bit about the community, I guess, first. Like, what's your role? How do you feel the community sort of is going from your perspective, like what you do? And what are some of the risk factors that are involved in the community? So, for the past year, as the nurse navigator for RHD and Healthy Skin, we have been going out into Mornington Island, Domogee and Normanton. It's been challenging. But very rewarding. We've been seeing some big changes out there, especially around the RHD stuff. Healthy Skin's programme is relatively new. We just did Domogee last week, which the community was very welcoming to us. Yeah, so... Cool. Yeah. Yeah, tell me a little bit about... RHD from your perspective and, like, some of the things in which you're trying to work towards in terms of outcomes for the community. So, RHD is rheumatic heart disease. It's a result of a Strep A infection that can attack your kidneys and your heart. It is 100% preventable. And, unfortunately, it is very well-known in small communities like Domogee, Mornington and Mount Isa. It has been... Can I just cut there? Yeah, sure. Sorry. Yeah, OK. The benefits, what I want to see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, when I first started a year ago, in the RHD factor, there was a lot of challenges. Sorry, can I mention the inquest and all that sort of stuff, or no? I don't know. What do you think? Is it important for the narrative? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, when I started last year, a year ago, in the RHD sector, it was quite challenging. It was a small team that we had. I'm going out into... I'm going out into remote areas was quite challenging. However, I've seen in the last 12 months a big change in this. The communities have been very opening and welcoming for us to come in and help them. The bisulin uptake was very poor last year, and this has now increased, especially in Domogee. They had... They had a 100% bisulin compliance end of last year, and their rates are about 90, 95% at the moment. So, that was non-existent before I started. This is a result of a good team that has been put in place, which you were talking to Abby. Unfortunately, Jayden couldn't talk. He's... He's working in remote at the moment. But it's about us all coming together and working as a team. What I want to see in the near future is a decrease of RHD, which kind of links into my program at the moment, which is healthy skin and promoting education around school sores, sore throats. And I think, you know, it's a big step, and we have to get our kids back into healthy lifestyles and all that, which will ultimately bring down the RHD rates, more presentations into primary health care before they end up getting ARF. And then RHD. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about what you know about Orange Sky, I guess. Like, do you know Orange Sky? What do you know about it? Orange Sky is... Orange Sky is... So, I've known about this. I've worked, my background in nursing has been mainly in remote areas. So I was working in Palm Island and that's when I first came across Orange Sky in Palm Island which was really good in there. A lot of people didn't have washing machines and all that sort of stuff so they were accessing that. Now it's now in Dumeji which it's been pretty good there. With the Healthy Skin team that we're working in on in Mount Isa, it has been challenging because part of our program is going into the houses, working with the families about you know making sure you'll get your sores seen to. If you do have scabies or anything like that, that you need to get your sores seen to. If you do have scabies or anything like that, that you need to be washing your linen and all that sort of stuff, your clothes, having clean clothes, clean linen. Unfortunately there's a lot of families in this area that don't have washing machines. So for our Healthy Skin team there has been a barrier because we've had to use the public laundry and having to use that instead of having Orange Sky to kind of come in and support us with that. I have heard that Orange Sky hopefully is coming on board. There was a two-week trial a few months ago which worked really well. So the RHD team were going out doing stuff with rheumatic heart disease patients and doing assessments. They were then bringing Healthy Skin and then Healthy Skin were linking in with Orange Sky and then they were bringing the van into the actual areas like Yelambie and all that and basically doing the Bisolin side of things that for RHD. Then doing skin checks and then also cleaning out the house and then doing the washing. So it was all done in one area and areas that are really needed, needing support and help. That's cool. So from a really high level what does washing do for someone who has those risk factors? How does that help in terms of reducing the risks? So washing your clothes, having clean linen and clean clothes is a necessity really. You know when you've got things like impetigo, scabies and all that sort of stuff, you've got your clothes, your line and your clothes, you've got your clothes, your line and your bed and all that sort of stuff. You need to have clean clothing just like you need to get up and have a shower every morning with soap and all that. If you're not cleaning your clothes and getting treatment, if we're going into the house as a Healthy Skin mob, we're treating them but if we're walking out and not doing a holistic approach on things, we're treating the skin issues but then they're just going to jump into bed with dirty linen and it's just going to re- the cycle's not going to break kind of thing. You need clean linen, you need clean clothes to break that cycle of the skin infections that are going on. Yeah. Cool. That's good. That's great. Yeah. I think that's it but is there anything else? What else do you think other things that you feel like you should touch on? Yeah. Yeah. In relation to what you do, like outcomes, what's collaboration and partnership for you? I would, yeah. So for me, I really want to talk about the shame factor in regards to having orange sky turn up. We need to make it more, I don't know what words, like more people shouldn't be feeling shame about the orange sky van coming to your house. It should be, oh look, this is awesome that they're there. Not like, oh shame, orange skies here. They're going to know that I've got this going on and they're thinking that I'm dirty and all that because that's not what it's about. So we need to make it more accepting in the community instead of pointing fingers and all that. So how we're going to get around that barrier kind of thing is something we as our HD team and the Healthy Skin team need to come together and kind of have yarns about. Also, what else did I want to talk about? The importance of Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here's my one question for everybody is, for the individual混ra and my book, Iص, I arises about seeing more Aboriginal health workers and practitioners working on the ground and working with the community type thing. Because having me, that comes from another country, in here, and trying to help in that there is a lot of barriers there. Whereas, if we are using community, like Aboriginal health workers who are coming from likeckeemahje, Mornesmith, and Mount Isa, they're going to connect with the, they're going to be more forthcoming than what it would be if I was to go in by myself and yeah, try and get support. That's basically it. Yeah. That's so good. That last bit was awesome. Yeah. That was a good banger, wasn't it? Yeah, that's it. Cool. Yay.\n",

So all you have to do is tell me your name and first name and last name, and spell it. Okay. And you can talk straight to me. That's, that's just weird. Okay. I'm\n\nSpeaker 16: Pam, PAM, or Pamela Ramsey. R-A-M-S-A-Y from Melbourne, obviously. What else do you need to Oh, spell it? Uh, yeah.\n\nR-A-M-S-A-Y. Amazing. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Tell me a bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 16: Well, I am. I'm nearly 70 years old. Hmm. Don't like saying that out loud. Um, I'm retired. I've been retired for a few years now. I'm widowed. I, my husband died a long time ago. Uh, I've got two grown up daughters and four grandsons. Um, so when I retired, um, I'm actually, I'm involved in a charity in Bali.\n\nUh, where we run a, I'm a massive animal lover and we run a des sexing [00:01:00] program for dogs and cats. And when Covid hit. I couldn't travel to Bali. I couldn't do any fundraising here, so I looked, I'd just retired. So I looked around for basically something to fill my time because Covid destroyed my retirement plans.\n\nMm-hmm. Um, and I found these guys on the website. I think I Googled volunteering opportunities or. Something like that because I didn't want to work with food and I didn't want to work in an op shop. And I went, oh, that looks good. And here I am, not quite four years later, I do usually twice a week. Um, yeah.\n\nSo good to be able. I love it. I love it here. It's, um, it's friendly. I live quite close to here and I actually know. Some of the people that come here, I see, oh, I don't really know them, [00:02:00] but I run into them in the shops and we have a chat and um, it's, you know, it's nice. It's a very homey sort of community around here.\n\nA bit different to some of the other challenging places that I travel to. Some of them are a bit more challenging than here. Here is very easy, very friendly, as you can see. Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Awesome spot.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, um. Um, is there something that's changed in you from starting to volunteer to now in terms of like maybe what help is or what homelessness is or anything around those types of things?\n\nUm,\n\nSpeaker 16: yeah, I think, I think, I think there, well we do, we do in here and we come across quite a few genuinely homeless. People, there's a lot of people living in their cars. Um, a lot of people live up in the mountains in the national park. Mm-hmm. You know, they'll [00:03:00] pitch a tent somewhere quiet up there. But most of the people that we deal with here, and also at Dandenong, where I go quite a lot, are not really homeless, but more disadvantaged and being able to help, you know, even if it's just your.\n\n10 or $15 a week to go to the laundromat to come here, I think makes a huge difference to their finances. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, I'm fortunate enough that I don't have to live on a tiny little pension, but, you know, it, it's a tough gig, um, especially for people who've gotta pay rent, doesn't leave them with very much.\n\nSo a lot of the people, they come here for a meal. They might come here for meals, they'll get their washing done, they go somewhere else tomorrow night for a meal. A lot of them travel to three or four different places through the week. Um, [00:04:00] which, you know, obviously helps out. Um, so yeah, I, I think let, there's, well, don't get me wrong, I, I'm not saying that there's not an issue with homelessness because there most certainly is, but, um.\n\nCertainly around here. Uh, it's not as much as I thought it would be, or they're just not coming here. There are, there are lots of, still lots of homeless people around here. There's a couple of guys that I see sitting outside the supermarkets and stuff that I never see come here. You know, I stop and have a chat to them and tell them about this place, but they don't want to come.\n\nA lot of them don't. They wanna be just left alone. Mm-hmm. Um, so yeah. Yeah. So I guess in that way it's, it's changed.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, I'm really interested in this idea of like, what is a story and how do people tell them? What's the idea of stories around the van, I guess? And are those stories powerful for you, for the people that come?\n\nOh [00:05:00] look,\n\nSpeaker 16: what's that like? Well, I think, uh, a lot of the people that come here look on us as their counselors. Um, we get told lots of stuff that probably don't. Need to know. Um, and, but it, it's good. I love it that they're comfortable enough, people are comfortable enough to come and tell us their troubles.\n\nUm, yeah, I mean obviously I'm not gonna share the stories that they tell us 'cause it's their, their stories. But, um, yeah, we do, we do hear lots and I'm sure they'd be happy to tell you. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: And what's, what's, where, where do you think that role of the volunteer is most, you know, more important? Like,\n\nSpeaker 16: well, it is definitely as a pseudo counselor, as well as, and, and a lot of the people that come here, uh, especially don't get their washing done, but they still come out and have a chat and, [00:06:00] you know, tell us their, they tell us their troubles.\n\nThey tell us the good stuff as well. Um, yeah, so. Uh, yeah, I think, um, certainly there's, there's certainly more to orange skies than doing people's washing. Um, and you know, we've become quite close to, to the point where if they're not here, I worry about them, which Steve in there always says, don't worry.\n\nThey, they come back. But I'll go home and worry about where, you know, somebody that I think is a bit vulnerable is if I don't see them the following week. Mm. Um, I've probably got better at that over the, over the four years. Yeah. Don't lay awake at night as much as I used to. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Um, what's been part of growth or enjoyment or whatever for you for this?\n\nLike what, what, why do you keep coming back? Oh, personally,\n\nSpeaker 16: [00:07:00] uh, look, people volunteer for all sorts of different reasons and, um, you know. Some of the volunteers that I've met, some, some of them do it to get hours on a uni degree or on a course or something. Some do it. I, I grew up in a family. We volunteered.\n\nI was brought up to always give back. Um, my mother was a doer, you know, she was involved in, she was one of those ladies that did that, did the flowers, and polished the brass, and she was a girl guide leader and. It's just, I don't, I don't know. It's just a thing I've always, I've always done. And once I retired, I was able to do more of it.\n\nAnd as I said, covid, I probably wouldn't have done it without Covid 'cause I would've just continued doing my, um, barley gig. Um, but I had time on my hands and I'm not good at having time on my hands. I have to fill my [00:08:00] time. Sure. So, yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, volunteering's just what. You know what people do, you, people either do, they're either a giver or a taker, I guess, but you know, and personally, you, you know, you, it makes you, it makes you feel good to help people, um, makes you feel good inside to know that you've helped somebody.\n\nYou are even, you know, just, and, and some people are so grateful to have their washing done. People who are genuinely homeless and you're able to give them. Especially in winter, you know, a nice basket of nice folded, clean, dry, nice smelling, washing makes them feel really good. So it makes me feel good.\n\nThat's really it. So\n\nSpeaker 15: awesome. Yeah. So good. Hey, I'm just gonna take a photo.\n\nSpeaker 16: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 15: I reckon I can do it like this.\n",

      "Transcript": "I'll give you a little sound test. Yep, testing. How's this? Yeah, that's it. Testing, testing. Okay, all right. Got a little bit of sound play. That's good. It adds some character. We'll get one more walk and then we're gone. All right, brother. Tell us your name and spell it for me. That's right. Just look at me. Yep. William Radke. W-I-L-L-I-A-M. Radke. R-A-D-K-E. Cool, man. Tell us a little bit about your school first. What school is it and a little bit about what your year is and stuff like that. Yep, so I go to St. Patrick's College, Mackay. I'm in grade 12 this year. I'm school captain. Yeah, I love going to school. It's a good school. Sure. And what else about Mackay? What do you like about Mackay? Have you been here very long? Yeah, yeah. I've lived always in Mackay. I love the beaches. I go fishing. I love the sport, the community and stuff that happens. Cool. And how did you first hear about Mackay? What did you first hear about Orange Sky? It was just an initiative through the school. We started the brekkie van a few years ago. We'd just come down to Orange Sky. We cook breakfast, the snags and some eggs while they wash their clothes, while it's drying. We cook them and then we have a conversation, which is really important. Wow. And like being a young fella, what do you feel, what do you feel like people like yourself, your age, what do you think they should interact with our friends and create opportunities? Yeah. Cool. Yeah, well, it's really important because everyone benefits out of it. And then when you come down here, you really understand and you can emphasise what it is like. And through that, then you can, you can lead to actions that do help. The brekkie van is an amazing opportunity to get active within the community. It's not just donating to a charity. It's getting down here. It's cooking the snags yourself and it's giving to these people. Cool, man. What's like, what do you think you'll take with you? Like I guess you go to school, you learn, you have education. Yeah. But why do you think it's important to have things outside of school that are community based? Yeah, definitely. Well, there's no point just knowing the numbers in the book. It's about talking to people one on one. It's about looking people in the eye and saying stuff that matters. Because in a job, in life, you're going to have to talk to people and you're going to have to do stuff that matters, that helps the community. And the brekkie van in Orange Sky is the perfect opportunity to make this happen. Cool. And what's it kind of feel like when you come down here? What's the process? Yeah, it's a good community. You rock up in the morning at 6am. You get the snags ready. You cook the barbie. You have the serving table. People start rocking up. They put their clothes in the washing machine. And then while they're doing that, you serve breakfast. There's tea and coffee. And then after that, you'll sit down. You have a good chat. And it's all very good for everyone. Sick. And like, what's the school community's vision, do you think, with supporting this stuff? Yeah. And like, what are you going to do with it in the future? Yeah. Well, I think it's really important for every student to get involved. It makes every student get down here to understand. And then that helps us in our future as well, where we take an action within our community. And I think many students after leaving school will continue to volunteer in groups like Orange Sky, where we can all help the wider community. And what do you think the impact of Orange Sky is, I guess, like, from a school and student perspective? Is it the washing, the conversation, the connection? What do you think is most important? Oh, it's huge. I think the conversation is the most important thing because, yes, the washing and the food is very important. But it's the conversations. It's the cathartic experience, getting to talk to people. It's giving advice. We hear some amazing stories. And as a student, you learn a lot. And it goes both ways. Everyone benefits from it. On this one, the car. I was just trying to do this to try and like, for the world's worst sun visor. Anything else you wanted to say about like the school, Orange Sky, or is there any other things that you want to say? Yeah, it's just a great opportunity for people to get active within the community. It benefits everyone. And it's an opportunity we're very lucky to have as students at St. Patrick's to come down here and to participate in the break event and Orange Sky. And I encourage anyone to do it in likewise opportunities in the area. Wow. Mate, you're a legend. Well done. Thank you. That was very well spoken. You've been doing a bit of that at school, yeah? Oh, a little bit, yeah. Cool. They'll tell you. Hey, just come here. I'll do a quick photo in front of the- Can I take a picture? I like the kids, boys. I'll do a picture. I'm not going to take pictures. That's okay. I'm not going to take a picture of you. We're doing a lot of good things. Yeah. That's nice. Right. So that's all, right? Just come here. I'll do my best just to see how bright this is. Yeah. Definitely. Well, we'll have to let it go. Yeah. That's good. I hate to be in the photograph. Good feedback. Alright brother, look at me. Come around here a little way and stop there. Alright. Well done. Thank you. Thanks brother. Yep, um, yep. Have you got a friend? Yep. Have you got a friend? Yep. Have you got a friend? Yep. Have you got a friend? Yep. Have you got a friend? Yep. Um, yep. That'll be quick mention is- Oh, we didn't talk but he, he said to, um, have this follow up as a spokesperson. We'd already spoken to him. I was keen to get a couple of words from him. Oh, if he's keen. Hey, Beth. How you doing? Good to be back. You got a minute for two words? Yeah, yeah definitely. Cool, come sit down. I had like, what, I turned fifty-eight this week, so, sixty per target. I'm just tackling The sun but that's okay. So what you can do with this you can actually put this behind of this in front Okay, it's like a magnet. So this on the back like under you. It's like that sort of thing Yes, so put the magnet on the front I reckon because then you hide that. Oh, okay. So I spin it around Yeah, okay. Let's do that. Are you right with that sun Ben?

      "Transcript": "Navjot Soni - Washing Machine Project\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nMy name is Navjot. \n\nI'm the founder of The Washing Machine Project and the washing machine project is addressing a huge global problem. 60% of the world have to hand wash clothes, and the burden of hand washing clothes is disproportionately placed on women and girls.\n\nIt takes up to 20 hours a week to do this backbreaking activity. It denies them opportunities to work, study, and rest. And we think that's really unfair at the washing machine project. And we're changing that one wash at a time. \n\nAt the heart of the Washing machine project we put the users at the center of everything that we do. It started on a promise to my next door neighbor, a lady called Divya who used to spend hours and hours a day, hand washing clothes.\n\nI promised her an alternative to that and that's why we called our machines the washing machine named after her. And. Every time that we [00:01:00] see someone visit someone across the world, we make sure to try and understand their needs and their behaviors so that we put their feedback into our design process.\n\nSo we've designed and manufactured the world's first flat packable manual washing machine. And it's based on user's feedback. And for me personally I get a spring in my step every time I wake up in the morning. This is the purpose that I wanna pursue. And I'm so lucky that I've managed to persuade other people to follow me on this journey.\n\nBut most importantly. We are here to serve people like Dvia and the 60% of the world. That hand wash goes. \n\nThe impact of the washing machine project and it's machines have been really profound. Some things I've just completely not expected, for [00:02:00] example, there's a lady in Uganda called Salma, who is in a foster care home, and she now earns money off the machine to pay for her diploma.\n\nWe have Patricia, who a school girl, 13 years old, wants to become a surgeon in a boarding school, in Senya primary school in Uganda, who often has to choose between. Studying or washing her clothes, she no longer has to make that choice. She can prioritize. What she wants to do is become a surgeon.\n\nWe have stories of people in refugee camps that have lost everything but have said, this makes me have more self-respect to have clean clothes and. For me, that's really important, keeping the users at the heart of everything that we do. And today we're here in, in Athens bringing together [00:03:00] incredible organizations, orange Sky, Ithaca, and dropping the ocean who are doing similar things in their work.\n\nWhether it's serving homeless people or refugees. It's very rare that you have organizations that have similar missions and want to be a collective. So this has been a kind of six or seven year dream of mine now, and I'm so glad that we're here together and you can feel the energy we're already like vibing off each other. \n\nIf this is what the future of our alliance looks like, then I think we're gonna be a really, we are gonna be a really good place really good organisations making really good impacts and putting the people that they serve at the heart of what they do.\n\nIt's important to understand each other's challenges because some challenges are very similar.\n\nSome are very [00:04:00] different. For example, I'm really interested and curious to know how Ithaca and dropping the ocean work with governments. 'cause that's something that we want to start to do. So there, I'm sure there's other organizations in a similar field that want to understand more about other aspects of what we do.\n\nFor example, our marketing and PR are really good. And I think it's about sharing ideas. And we are, we're better together. It's, we're making amazing happen for a better world. And, there's more that we can do together than apart. And I think having similar challenges and working though through those challenges together it's a quick, it's obvious.\n\nIt's like a one plus one equal three moment. My team will tell you that I'm the most competitive person ever. It's probably not a healthy thing, but it keeps us focused. I think it's important to set ambitious goals, to have something that we can aim at. So for the washing machine project, we want to impact a million people by 2030.\n\nSo [00:05:00] long steep curve ahead. But me personally, I had this vision of bringing organizations together. I was fed up of having separate organizations, separate conversations with organizations. And, I'm a connector, I'm a community builder, and I want people all around the table.\n\nSo I guess for me, visualizing it, thinking it. Helps bring everyone together. And I hope, my, my wish for communities and alliances like these are to just keep flourishing and for I've found a hack in my life. Which is the more you give is the more you get. It's a really selfish way of looking at it.\n\nBut the more you give to society, the more you reap the rewards of society. And I'm so energized by just the last two hours. Being together. And I'm really excited with how this pans out in the future and I can see this forming into something amazing, and [00:06:00] challenging what's existing.\n\nBecause I think we need to continue to innovate and continue to evolve and, we've been. We've all been a part of organizations or tried to be a part of organizations that, are not taking this seriously and there's a real need. Four different organizations with hundreds of employees have.\n\nShowcase that need, and I think being together is helpful to highlight that need as well. Amazing. Now I've gotta talk to this other fellow.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Anthony Hegerty\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nI've gotta remember to clap my hands 'cause I always forget.\n\nAnd then 2.8 I was at, I think I was 2.8.\n\nFuck. That's close enough, I reckon. Okay, so you're gonna look at me over here? Yeah. I'm gonna check my eye line. It's pretty rad, Cole. So all you need to do is, I can actually read your name on your badge there, but maybe tell me your name and spell it for me. Is helpful? Yeah. Remember? So my name is Anthony Hegerty.\n\nH-E-G-A-R-T-Y. Cool. And Anthony, tell us a little bit about yourself first. X out of work, you mean? Okay. Where do I start? So I live out in high fields. Have a couple of dogs married, two kids. One of the kids is in Brisbane, one still lives with us. I play the drums. I play the bass guitar. I do a [00:01:00] lot of online gaming.\n\nYep. Cool. How'd you first hear about Tom Net? Oh, okay. I was in between jobs and Tom Net was going through a, a little bit of a rough patch and they were looking for someone to fill a position here. And a suggestion was made to go a little bit left field in terms of the job or the person who was going to fill that job.\n\nAnd I'd been in business management, hospitality management for quite a few years. And it had nothing to do with mental health, nothing to do with older people except from a family point of view. And I was approached by Louise, who was the manager then. She proposed an idea as to what, I would potentially do here.\n\nAnd I thought, I've got nothing to lose. Seems like an interesting idea. 42-year-old working in an older men's organization was a little wow, that's a bit possibly left field. And I said, yep, why not? I'll give it a try. I, [00:02:00] and yeah, 12, 12 years later. Wow. Still here. What's some of the thematics or values or moments over those 12 years that stand out for you?\n\nI. I think probably making friends with a lot of the fellows. I think I've, I think I've made an environment for them to talk to me not only as a counselor, but also as a friend and given them hopefully a safe environment where they can share stuff that's going on in their lives. Without any judgment.\n\nAnd without, I don't give them advice. You go, mate. Okay. You can go through. How are you? Hi Charlie. I'm good. Filming. It's no Netflix special or anything. It's just a little video. You're all good. Thanks, rather. So I think, yeah and seeing the difference in the fellas and the whole benefit of fellows getting [00:03:00] together.\n\nAnd, just being able to share stuff with each other in a, hopefully again, an environment that makes it safe for them to do that. Yeah, it just yeah, it just seems to happen. What's it like when someone new comes, what do you see as in their journey? Yeah. As they come and hang out with with Tom Net I I guess I secretly wish that they, hopefully are going to enjoy it and see that the benefit of just fellows getting together, but then also taking that, that next step of.\n\nNot only coming here and walking through the door meeting fellows, but then also going back out in the community that, that's my ultimate goal for these fellows is to not just, and I don't say it as just sitting around talking 'cause that's very valuable. It's about going back out in the community and trying to, find your tribe, find a community and programs that we [00:04:00] run.\n\nGive, they have that ability for fellows to find their tribe. So for ex, for example with a reading program up at the local host high school, there's nothing better than walking into the school and students are saying, Hey, Mr. Whatever and feeling a part of the place or the teachers saying, hi Anthony, or Hi Angus, or whatever.\n\nThat's, how can you not like that? And. You don't get that with every volunteering opportunity. Having young people and older people all welcoming you along and being part of that community. So that's what we try to do. It's and that's what I want the fellows to get. I want them to experience that.\n\nBecause a lot of times, they've worked their selves to death in their jobs for 50 years, and then they're looking for something. And hopefully we can provide that. So I like to see that's my goal for them. Part of the stuff that's special is it's, I think there's always this idea of [00:05:00] social impact when you have an organization or a charity or a not-for-profit.\n\nAnd part of what I see here is. Impact for the tom net people, but also impact for the community. But then I think there's this third space where people don't think about, which is what's the impact, what's the compound impact of those young people having elders and stuff? How do you see that as like an impact, opportunity or how do, how can you talk about that where people get to understand that impact?\n\nWe, we love the youth based programs. We're part of, even though our motto is older men supporting other older men, we do that as well in youth programs. So our older men are getting benefit from it, and then the youth are getting benefit from it. But I see that in terms of probably the two programs like the Flexi School and the one that we do up at Centenary High.\n\nThe impact that our [00:06:00] fellows, even in just a small way, we're only talking an hour a week that our fellows spend with these teenagers or students, but. These students actually want to get somewhere, they want to get their driver's license, they want to get a job, they want to get their HSC, so they actually want to be part of the program as well.\n\nSo it's not like our fellows are going into a program where there's pushback from the students, but they don't want to be part of it, or they're forced to be a part of it. So the impact that, that our fellows are making. They're just part of that, so they're part of that bigger picture of these students.\n\nThese students might forget about 'em in three years time, but at least they've helped them learn how to read a grade one book, and they're in grade 12. So the impact that they're making on those children or students, I don't, it can't be measured. It can be measured by them getting their license and getting a job and all that [00:07:00] sort of stuff.\n\nIt's just a small part in that whole picture, I think. Does that make sense? Oh, awesome. So good. What's what's some of the challenges for, to over the next little while? Funding is always a challenge. I don't have a lot to do with that, but I know it's an issue. I think also.\n\nA challenge that we're having at the moment is the I think this demographic for a lot of them have had an increased abundance of wealth, so therefore they're out spending that money, so they're out traveling and we are potentially missing out on a lot of those people or those men who may have not done as much traveling because of.\n\nThey may not have had the money to do it, whereas now they might. That's a small percentage. I'm not saying everyone's in that position, but our organization doesn't, we don't, we look at all different walks of [00:08:00] life for men. So it doesn't really matter what stage someone's in terms of either their wealth or their health or just what they're doing in retirement.\n\nI. That doesn't really play any part in being able to become a member of Mnet. So I guess in a way we probably are missing out on a certain portion of the men who might normally come to Mnet, which we want to be part of Mnet, because the whole retirement thing doesn't just affect people in low socioeconomic circumstances.\n\nIt, it affects, professionals. People as well. There's plenty of research on that in terms of the effects of retirement on professionals. They struggle, can struggle just as much as someone who might have been a laborer all their life. And that's what makes it interesting because, one day, you might be dealing with, or talking to someone who's been a farmer their whole life.\n\nThey've got a unique set of issues going on in their life, but then the next day you are [00:09:00] talking to a. A judge or a barrister who's going through exactly the same issues and you're like, wow. Hell, it's interesting. So good. And the next five years say, is there a little five year dream thing that you've got in your mind or what's like a milestone that you are looking forward to?\n\nI think for me, I would love to be able to. Travel the country, giving presentations to older fellas and not convincing them, but certainly putting forward the idea of getting involved in these sorts of activities from a social and a volunteering point of view. I, to me, volunteering is almost the number one thing for fellows should be doing in retirement.\n\nWhile I appreciate fellows might like playing golf every day of the week, there may not be as much purpose in that as there is in [00:10:00] doing volunteering for youth based programs or visiting aged care facilities. So I think that would be a really good golf for someone like me. I think I could do that, but I also think I'd like to be able to set up a program.\n\nTo have a men's group in just about every aged care facility as well, so that men are visiting other fellows who are isolated in aged care facilities. Men suffer really, they have a hard time in aged care facilities. Most of them are 80% women in age care facilities. And men suffer from health issues that prevent them from being social when they get older.\n\nSo that then forces them to stay in their rooms and not get any social interaction. So to be able to provide, as we do already, but to be [00:11:00] able to provide social interaction for older fellas in age care facilities. All retirement villages on a massive scale would be just absolutely fantastic. This is awesome.\n\nIs there anything, that you've always wanted to talk about around time that you think people don't know about? Or is there areas we haven't touched on that you think are important? That we make the most outta catching? I think the biggest thing that I think a lot of fellows, and I'm generalizing obviously I don't think fellows give things a good enough chance in terms of what the outcomes should be or could be.\n\nThey'll do something once or twice and they go, ah, this is not for me, and then they won't do it again. I think the biggest thing for us is. And I tell fellas when they considered joining Tom or coming to Mnet, that you've gotta give it at least [00:12:00] three or four goes before you make up your mind.\n\nDon't come once and go, I hated that. And then continue doing what you're doing. So I think to try and get to tell fellas that you've gotta give things a chance, whatever it is especially here yeah, you've got to just gotta take the plunge and go, I'll give it, I'll give it three or four goes.\n\nIf I don't like it, then fine. And then we can help you find something else if you want. But they've gotta give it at least a good shot and then make a decision rather than just go, ah, I've been once and that wasn't for me. I'm not going back. I think that's probably something that. People would need to know.\n\nI dunno if that answered the question or not. Sorry. Good, bro. All right. That's about it. Unless there's anything else. I'm gonna take a quick photo if there's anything else. How long have you got Ben?\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Kate Bjur\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nKate Bjur: Name is Kate Buer. \n\nSpeaker 7: B J U R. \n\nI'm currently working for Peak Care, which is a peak body for children and families in Queensland.\n\n~And ~I'm the Executive Director for Research and Advocacy. \n\nMy history is pretty much always surrounded, children and young people are always at the centre. I've had some time in education, child protection, youth justice and through\n\nKate Bjur: and legislation and other roles within government looking at the whole system around child protection, youth justice, those types of systems.\n\n~Gosh, it's really hard to do anything else for me. ~This is an absolute passion of mine. I'm just dedicated to young people. Particularly around those teenage years. I think that's a window of opportunity. It's a time when all of us need people who surround us, people we can trust, people who've got our backs.\n\nWe all are [00:01:00] going through identity work at that time. And anyone who's in any of those systems, usually has quite a lot to unpack from their childhood. Often a lot of mistreatment and trauma. But still, for me, those years are the opportunity to focus on the future and make changes in places where the support is right and it's provided and it's timely.\n\nMy experience is that Young people can absolutely make the changes needed to live the lives that we all hope and expect for our kids.\n\nBelonging and connection is massive. I did a lot of research into why young [00:02:00] people join gangs and how young people can be supported to leave gangs. Often it's the belonging and connection they were looking for that they'd missed earlier that brings them into the gang. Usually doesn't turn out to be what they had hoped it would be, and in the end It's a different kind of belonging that can then help them leave, maybe they then belong to a family or starting their own family or they find a job that they really care about and a group of people that they can work with on a common purpose.\n\nI think we all need. To have a solid sense of our own identity. That comes into play a lot with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander people and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities who've sometimes felt outside of the common culture but also ~people ~from groups like LGBTQIA plus, there are vulnerabilities there, but every person ~is going through and ~needs to have a sense of their identity.\n\n~And so ~for me, connection and identity are massive that connect all humans. \n\nSpeaker 10: ~Yeah, ~let's jump into Diagramma. Why did [00:03:00] you go there? \n\nSpeaker 9: So I'd heard about Diagramma. I was working in the youth detention system and looking at best practice models from around the world. I'd seen some stuff online.\n\nSpeaker: I'd read things and heard things, but I had no idea what it was going to feel like when I actually got ~to go ~there. I went on a Churchill Fellowship. I was lucky enough to be one of the hundred odd people every year that Australia sends overseas to investigate something they're passionate about.\n\nMy commitment to the Churchill Trust was that I would learn and bring my knowledge back to Australia. The Spanish diagram model was one of ~the countries, ~the six countries ~that ~I went to and explored how they do youth detention. ~And ~I just can't tell you how blown away I was from the very second that I walked in.\n\n~I, ~my first impression was, I was looking around and seeing things. that ~stuff in ~my center would consider very risky. I saw young people using power tools. I saw, gym equipment that we wouldn't [00:04:00] necessarily approve because of a risk to human safety. There was very few people who were in that security guard role.\n\n~And ~my first question for the people running those places was why do I feel so safe? Why is it okay for me to just be walking around here? There were families arriving, and walking through the center. ~And ~I was told basically two things happen in Diagramma that contribute to that. One is the young people are working towards something very valuable to them.\n\nAnd that comes with being able to show that you can live and work and operate in a respectful way. A gradual loosening of the strict rules ~in the rule book, ~gradually getting more responsibility over how you run your day, gradually earning the right ~to be able ~to go out into the community. I saw a group of young men with high vis vests on, head to the door of the reception at one place, take out tool belts and things out of a locker and head off for the day.\n\nAnd I really wanted to explore why that was so [00:05:00] valuable to young people to the point where they would ~work and ~work with their positive behavior and showing safe behaviors to be able to do that. ~And I, so ~I sat down for lunch with this young man who I will always remember ~and he was talking about, ~this was a Monday morning.\n\nHe just had a family weekend, so he got released for the weekend to go home. He talked to me about having had some friends over on ~the ~Friday or ~the ~Saturday night and had some drinks with them. And he talked to me about having a fight with his dad. And I thought, ooh, risky. Again, I'd been running a youth detention centre in Queensland and I thought All I was seeing was a short term risk perspective.\n\nAnd after I heard this young man's story ~about his reflection was, ~now I've booked some extra sessions with my drug and alcohol counsellor, ~I know that I've got more work to do there. ~I've also got a family therapy session with Dad booked in for later this week. I know I've got more work to do there so that when I get out and when I get home I'll be ready and I've practised those skills.\n\nAnd so I started thinking about short term Risk for long term gain and what's the trade off, the number of young people who leave [00:06:00] diagramma centers and never offend again is unbelievable, best in the world. And I think a big part of it is that preparing for life on the outside, staying connected to community, building community connections where you don't already have them, and that gradual trust being built and developed until you Are ~you ~ready to be on your own in the community again?\n\nBen: A lot of people talk to me ~around ~like it's yours and\n\nit's made for them.\n\nSpeaker: It's such a great question because I rave about certain things that I saw in Scandinavian countries and that society doesn't exactly equate to here and I've raved about things I saw in Spain and the US and none of those communities are the same as they are here so I've done two things.\n\nOne is I've tried to look for elements of all of the successful models that I [00:07:00] saw and bring them together and say what do those models have in common? Things like a gradual reintegration. Integration with community and making sure that families are always involved, a ~co ~couple of the things that work in lots of places.\n\nSo that's step one. ~And the other thing is, I think, is that ~young people ~here ~currently involved in the system, young people who have been involved in the system, aboriginal elders, community members, people who work in our youth justice services, we actually need to really help them understand and engage and see if we can figure out if it's appropriate for here.\n\nAnd the other thing that I ~probably ~recommend would be piloting it, starting small, seeing if it works in our context, and then growing from there. \n\nBen: What's the main, I don't want to get too prickly, but what's like the main things you've been shipped in [00:08:00] Australia?\n\nSpeaker: It's so challenging how much money and effort we put into when things go wrong. The tertiary systems, mental health support, youth justice, child protection, homelessness. Those are things that all of the strategies around those things come back to prevention and early intervention. And there are places in the world that are focused very heavily on prevention and early intervention.\n\nAnd those are the places that have. had to wait 10 or more years for the outcomes to start rolling in. And so it's actually about, I think, implementing things that we know works, but also having the patients to follow through with that course until we see the outcomes. ~The other thing, and it comes.~\n\nBack to young people's voice again. ~I had a, an example of, so ~my team and I at Peak Care had been gathering research about [00:09:00] why early intervention is so important, why prevention is important and why supporting families early is important to reduce ~all of that all of ~that impact on the system later.\n\n~And then ~I was in a youth detention centre last year and I sat down with a young man that I knew well and I said to him, what tell me about your early primary school experiences. What was life like for you back then? And he said, He talked about mum had been running away from a violent relationship.\n\nShe took him and his five siblings with her everywhere she went, but they moved and moved ~and moved. So ~his early years of primary school were really disjointed. He went to lots of different schools. He wasn't able to make friends. He wasn't able to meet any other adult that he could ~then ~rely on.\n\nHe ended up in the child protection system. ~And again, ~multiple foster carers, multiple placements, multiple more schools. Young Aboriginal men had never had any. access ~really ~to his continuous culture and identity creation ~there. ~He fell behind academically, he started to act out because the shame of not understanding what was going on in the classroom made him feel better on the outside of the classroom [00:10:00] being punished than on the inside looking dumb.\n\nAnd then the first group of people that he ever felt accepted by was a group of young people who similarly were outside of ~the classroom. ~the classroom and ~he, ~his youth justice involvement spiraled from there. ~And ~this young man at 16 was talking me through his story and he said to me, miss, I don't think I'd be in here if they didn't give mum that help back then.\n\n~And ~I think we just have to make the connection between the research and the voices of the people who are in those systems to understand how important it is to support people as early as [00:11:00] possible.\n\n~Yeah. ~What does it feel like is incredibly accurate because the minute you go to a diagram center you can feel that something's different. You can feel that, young people are being cared for as children ~and you can feel something when you walk in. ~But not everybody gets to go and walk through a diagram center and feel that feeling that anyone who's been there can feel.\n\nThere are ways of. Every person in the community getting involved with young people in those systems and, sharing a skill with them or learning about their stories. ~There are ways to do it like that. But, ~everybody's got the same goal, fewer victims, right? I don't feel like there's a dichotomy between people who offend and victims of offenses and which ~ones ~needs ~need ~to be put first because everybody agrees that once we are successful ~That ~there aren't victims anymore.\n\nEverybody agrees on that being our baseline measure of success. ~So ~outside of re [00:12:00] offending statistics, numbers in youth detention centers, I went to a youth detention center in Scotland with 300 beds ~And ~I played a game of pool with the last two kids in there. ~So ~the last two kids under 18, who are in a high walled youth detention centre, and the rest are in residential settings.\n\n~So I, ~I think we all agree that what we want is to reduce the number of victims, reduce the offending, and the way to do that is to heal and support young people to live their best lives, ~because ~when young people have been healed and supported, they're contributing to our communities. They're not just not offending, they ~like all of us and all of our kids ~actually contribute and give back and are active members of the community and I think it would be hard not to feel that.\n\nBen: Anything else? Missing? \n\nSpeaker: ~No, all good. ~Well done. Thank you.\n\n",

I I never used to tell people we short staff, because I'm not short. Yeah. Alright, bud, tell us your name. What's your, what's your full name? My name is Cliff Plummer. How do you spell that?\n\nCliff? My last name, PLU double MER. Plumber by name, but not by trade. Tell us, tell us a bit about yourself, brother. What do you do? Well, I've been in the health area for 38 year. I retired last year, but found retirement life so boring. So back to work. Tell us all about Tenant Creek and, and what's it like here?\n\nYeah. I'm a local from here. I'm a Warga man. Yeah. But my. Country is north here. My grandfather country. [00:01:00] Yeah. At the old Phillip Creek mission area. Yeah. And yeah, I went to school up and Darwin, so Darwin is my second home sort of thing, you know, but I love coming back home. Cool. And what, what's the stuff that you, you get your most, um, amount of, sort of, um, pride and, and value from, um, from what you do?\n\nWell. Like with my role, you know, like as a Aboriginal health practitioner, I like helping people. Now I'm here with the health promotion team. See, I do a lot of health education, eh, and yeah, like getting involved, sending health messages through music and that, or YouTube, you know, is one of the things. I'm sort of looking at doing.\n\nYeah. She only just started here. Yep. [00:02:00] Um, tell us what, what do, what do you think are some of the, the issues here in, in the town that you specifically are, are looking to improve? Oh, you know, like just the main. Issues like everywhere else, you know, you got alcohol and other drugs and, and that's the sort of thing, try and target, you know, like, um, get health messages across, um, because, you know, alcohol and other drugs, you know, they, um.\n\nLike put a lot of us in hospital and that, you know, like, and long term thing, we have more health issues than that, you know. And what about sleeping? What's that's that like in community in terms of bedding and sleeping and that sort of arrangement? [00:03:00] Well, like it's really hard because with. A lot of the issues are alcohol, you know, like have noises and that, you know, and so I don't like really talking about, you know, my family making noises and all this sort thing, but you know, like that's one of the biggest issue, you know?\n\nAnd yeah, you can't sort of rest, you need to get a rash late at night, you know? Mm-hmm. And. Yeah. And what about mattresses? What are people sleeping on around there? Ah, they just get whatever from the store there. Some buy swags and that, you know, but I tried the mattress there is very comfortable and, and that's the reason why I was the first one that ask, [00:04:00] tell, tell us what it was like building the mattress.\n\nLike what, how did you find the, that process and how do you think it. It's pretty simple, you know? And yeah, easy and, but with some people would have issues. Like me, see, I had a couple of strokes and a lot of the time I can't get up. If I have two of those things, the crate stuff, I'd be okay. You know, I'd just get up and, but yeah.\n\nYeah. One, it's a bit difficult. How, how many do you think that we can make in community? What's the need do you think, in terms of building the mattresses? Oh, it's just really hard to say, you know, like, um,\n\npeople have to try it out, you know? And if you go demonstrate like in the community living area, for example, and get the community members to try it out, you know, [00:05:00] you'll get better results there, you know? Yeah. You got any, what's your, like, hopes and dreams through the community over the next little while?\n\nHave you got some things that you will hope, uh, are gonna come to fruition over the next little while and, um, for, for your, for people here? Nah, not really. I just sort of take one step at a time, you know? And yeah. And hopefully things work out, you know. Hmm, cool. Like the music in YouTube and that, that's one of my big games.\n\nYou know, health messages, I mean, not music. Yeah, I'd love to see some. Yeah. Cool. Well, yeah, yeah. No worries. Thanks Raz. Yeah.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\"text\": \" Just click on that. Nicole, so you just have to say your full name and it's done. Natalie Friday, N-A-T-A-L-I-E-F-R-I-D-A-Y. Nicole, how long? Tell me a little bit about yourself first. OK, I'll put that down. So, I'm born in Townsville and grew up on Palm Island. I spent a lot of my formative years living on Palm. Palm is a home to me because my grandparents were sent to Palm many years ago under the Aboriginal Protection Act, so they were forcibly removed from their homelands, traditional homelands. They're from Cape York Peninsula. So they're also called Palmolena Home. I identify through my grandfather as an Eastern Googiallanji person and through my grandmother I identify as an Okla person. But I also identify as a Bulgaman woman having come and growing up in Palm. We moved from Palm when I was about 11 years old up to the homelands of my grandfather's country on Eastern Gugyalangi country so we moved up to to a little place called Wujawujal and then Cook. So I spent a lot of time with my elders up in Eastern Gugyalungi country from there and then moved back down to Townsville and spent some time in Townsville which brought about me having found my partner and then having six children. So I have three boys and three girls. Moved around a little bit, just lived on their country out in Mount Isa but also moved up to Cooktown ourselves and then we moved to Cairns. So my working experience within cultural and natural resource management began working for Bulkanoo Cape York Development Corporation in Cairns under the Working on Country Ranger Program back in 2010. So I worked for the Noonkul Rangers based up at Shipton's Flat. From there, I left and then we moved back to Townsend. I then took up a position with NQ Dry Tropics, so a lot more work within the natural resource management sector. After working at NQ Dry Tropics, I moved to North Queensland Land Council, got a bit of experience with Natal Title claims and working within the realm of Natal Title determinations and applications and prescribed body corporates. From there I moved to Palm to work for Palm Island Community Company and worked as a project coordinator under our Early Childhood Learning and Parenting and Health and Wellbeing project. for young mums and then also helping children transition from kindergarten to prep and also helping parents being the first identifiers for early childhood development especially if there was kids who were beyond or in their development mental milestones that was a really good project from then I left I actually I actually did a bit of stint with Cape York partnerships working for for Cape York leaders program where they were the Cape York partnerships had given or they do a program what they do in Cape York leaders where they offer scholarships and support provide support services for kids coming from Camp York and through boarding school so I helped there as a student support teacher based at Cathedral in Townsville for Cape York kids who were sent down there for boarding school and then I had a little break which then took me back home on Yellinger country where I worked with Jebel Binay Yellinger country where I worked with Jebel Binay Yellinger Aboriginal Corporation as a report writing consultant helping them write their annual report and putting together a reporting framework because it was a very first annual report that they did. From there I moved down and back down to Palm Island and worked for my Yuma group under the umbrella of Rainbow Gateway as a mentor on the community development planning program. So working with job seekers or those who have just been placed in jobs and helping them mentor them once they've been placed in job to help them you know pretty much retain their employment or whatever support services they need connecting them referring them being a sort of a liaison person between a newly placed participant to newly placed participant to with service providers or the employee and then I left and I worked for as an executive officer with the Pudmore and Shire Council to just an executive officer to the councillors and the mayor exclusively and that was quite a learning experience for me because it just more it was just a different legislation and just a different realm of environment for me to work in. But then I also picked up a job with the Rangers, so the Minga Minga Rangers, and left the work with the council, and so I'm now full-time with the Rangers. Amazing. Yeah. What an experience. Yeah, it's quite an experience. Yeah. What an experience. Yeah, it's quite an experience. Yeah. And today, what are we doing today? What's your connection to what's happening today? Well, being a senior ranger with the Minga Minga Ranger Program, from my understanding, the task or the project that we've done today was to take our team out with a collaborative effort with the Orpheus Island Research Centre and JCU and a diver spot out here which is a very cultural significant site to the Mungburra people but with their permission they've allowed some Boogerman people in and in the story and it's just it's a woman's dreaming site so it was was just an opportunity to capture some of the site on footage and just get down there and have a look at it visually. Amazing. And what do you feel like being here and being connected to this place? Palm Island has a lot of natural beauty, but also it has a lot of cultural values that I value a lot and I feel that are very sacred. So for me, I think that's what makes the Pomol community so strong is that there's this collaborative stewardship, environmental stewardship between the Wulgaman and the Mumbarra people. So that's why, because it's not just like, oh, they're really close and connected to the country, but it's more they actually care for the country and getting out here and they're very protective of the waters and the lands that surround Palm Island. It's a very natural beauty, yeah. I think you spoke so well about this stuff. You're going to have to get in front of that camera one day, right? No. Pretty good. What do you hope this stuff does, like in terms of us coming out here and telling this story, what do you hope is the effect of that? I just hope that first of all I'm a big advocate for traditional ecological knowledge, so just trying to get a bit of Indigenous knowledge out there and understanding that it's really in line with modern day science. So traditional science and modern day science are the same sciences, it's just a different application and a different knowledge base that's formed on it. But for me, I think for Indigenous science, the holistic science, it's not a breakup of all sciences, whereas modern science breaks up a lot of the science and it's very segmented. But I hope that with projects like this that you can capture some of the stories that are embedded within the landscape for traditional people and there's an appreciation and allows other people to not only see how like first people's perspectives, but also change some of their perceptions and how they view the environment, yeah. Rad, and last question, what's your hopes and dreams in terms of like your role in the Rangers? What do you hope to achieve? I hope to inspire the next generation to be to take a career in environmental science especially marine science and not only not only take the lead but also just be innovative and be and be be willing to make a bit of change and have a bit of passion and um i think just i think that comes with gratitude and having gratitude and having um appreciation and not only that but just um being aware and having respect for the country and the culture within it yeah so rad well done thank you Really nice to meet you. Thank you. I'm looking forward to working closer with you and seeing what we can do together. I've only just recently gone through a program with the Coral Sea Foundation and it's a Sea Women's of the Great Barrier Reef program and it just inspires women of the Great Barrier Reef to get certified training. Like I've got my scuba license now and I've got a boat license but it's also we're going out and doing marine monitoring of sites and using a lot of the data that mainstream science is used to collect and monitor and store and then use. What is that connection with modern science and traditional knowledge? It's just different tools it It's the same information. It's just... So it's the same... I think modern science collects the same information that was collected many, many years ago by First Peoples, but now they're just using different tools, instruments, and it's just presented differently. But it's the same... I think it's pretty much the same knowledge that's out there so interesting yeah amazing well thanks for sitting down are you here for like the next few days are you going i'm going to leave on friday okay what are you doing tomorrow tomorrow i'll be probably at the ranger base doing time sheets yeah actually i've got to get that in by 10 a.m. in the morning Oh cool, Rich is allowing me to stay at the range of stations so hopefully I'm not too much of a pain in the arse No, you gonna pull up a bed or something? Well yeah like Nick's coming on Friday so we'll keep with what beds like for them but until then I'll have to put on a swag or something because that's what we're here on, on the weekend. We're just going to build beds. We've got 100 beds we're going to build. Oh, wow. Yeah. It's a big event this weekend. Yeah, so we're just going to rock up with a footy car and see who wants to bed and make them up. I think I really like that Paige come along. She's only just left school. Yeah. Yeah, she's awesome. She's joined the range. She's got a lot of intimate knowledge just from being out and interacting with like the ocean. She goes out on the reef a lot. Yeah, good energy too. Yeah, but it's like for me when I do a course or when I'm doing some training or even if it's just meeting new people, I try to just do it first before the next generation comes through so then I know what sort of advice I can give the next generation in doing it. It's awesome to have local people coming through these programs and being able to be the influencers. Well I worked with the Ranger Group up on my grandfather's country and my very first project was to go in the State Archives of Queensland and repatriate all the data that was on the State Archives of Queensland and repatriate all the data that was on the State Archives. So that was a three month job of just sitting in the State Office in Cairns and just going through like boxes, archive boxes of this site, they call them little site cards, they were like yellow site cards and had like all these cultural sites that were documented. Some had photographs, some just had little pictures. Some had audio files and then it was just putting them in and scanning them and putting it onto a cultural database for elders to hold onto. Yeah, it took a while but we got it all back and then it just met off just building upon that and some of the attributes that they captured on their site card we looked at it and we thought no we could capture more data. So it was going back to our elders and actually doing lots of whiteboard sessions and saying so this is what historically the state has collected in terms of cultural knowledge what are the things that we want to capture and like my elders had written down all the other things that they want to capture and it was really good who else It was really good. Who else do you reckon I should yarn with? Should I yarn with Aunty? Yeah, Aunty Peg. I think she should. She's there. Oh, she's good. Thanks so much. I made a big mess, I think. No, that's not me. Is it? No, I don't think so. I hope I did that right. It was amazing. Well done. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but there's going to be a delay.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "Rich and Ranger\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRich and Ranger: Ah, there'll be about 15 of us, eh? 10 to 15. Yeah. Maybe more. What's the make up? We'll be everyone together. Yeah. So kayak ranges are based out of here. And they have about 10. Yeah. Some are fee for service. Fee for service ranges run under contracts. Yeah. So they're not full time. They're casual. Yeah. And then we have a state government funding and federal funding through EHP and IAS ranges.\n\nRight. So there's 8 ranges that are employed through the IAS and EHP. Give and take every year, depends on how much money they want to throw back towards kayak. And then, yes, they've got fee for service rangers, the full time rangers are EHP IAS rangers, so they're full time, they get all the entitlements.\n\nAnd then we have Nari Bujong Jarra, that's the National Parks. Nari Bujong Jarra is the National Parks for the islands. So Queensland Parks and Wildlife throw a chunk of money back at kayak to employ the MBD rangers, that's Nari Bujong Jarra. And we [00:01:00] have about four or five of them rangers. that are employed joint management with Queensland Parks and Wildlife.\n\nSo Queensland Parks and Wildlife have about eight rangers that are employed here. Wow. Yeah, so we have Queensland Parks and Wildlife rangers, EHP rangers, IAS rangers, MBD rangers, and we've just started up the Marine Parks. So now we've got Marine Parks rangers getting ready to start on board as well. But also, these two dongers, one of them's based for machine and operations.\n\nSo we got, well I'll show you them in a minute when we go down there, all our tractors, backhoes. So that's a specific staff member that's assigned to, right? Yeah, so that's just for, yeah, that's for the maintenance for tracks and machineries. Yep. And in here's parks. Yep. And kayak. Yep. Say, um, tools, equipment, stuff like that, we'll go and have a look.\n\nAnd Uncle Darren's office is here, and the boss's office is there. So breakdowns and that kind of gear doesn't impact the mangrove operation? No. Because you've got these things. That's right. So if we need to, if we need to use a machine to go and do track [00:02:00] work, Parks will have our own, through Parks, our own tractors and stuff like that.\n\nBut if we don't and we need to use kayak, then we just go to their machine operator and go, Look, we need you to go and do this, so and so, and then he takes that obligation on to make sure that they do. And if they've got a, Charge kayak, or charge anyone, or any parks and that, but they'll do it, so. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, so it's all circles like that. Oh, okay, yeah, so it's circular. Yeah, yeah, all circles. Yeah, um, and then the other one is machinery feeds boats. Yes, machineries. Okay. But then they got another one for boats. Yeah. So in that shed there are two giant boats. Yeah. So that comes under. So let's have a look at that one, then we'll talk through the boats.\n\nIs that alright? Yeah. This is amazing. This is bloody good, because I, I dream this stuff, and the boys just go, You know, and I go, hold on wait a sec, slow up, we've got to be compliant before, yeah. Here we go. These are the old ones, these are some of the [00:03:00] Rangers when they did their first radio, Rodeo for Turtles.\n\nRodeo, wow. This fella here, when he was young, that's him now. Oh wow. Yeah. Oh wow. There's Jakey, he's not up there. Which he's not up there either. But yeah. He's about, what, twelve thirds in there? Yeah. And there he is there. And he works on Morton now. He works on Morton now? Yeah.\n\nThis is all the land areas that we work on. So you can have asparagus, but asparagus grows everywhere through the whole island. So we don't just look after Australia. We've got goat island, bird island. Peel Island, all these other bay islands that we have to manage and look after too, um, but yeah, Bidu bush surveys, track maintenance, could be on any track on the island, planned burns, Yarramin walking tracks, so we've got walking tracks we've got to maintain for the tourists and tourist season.\n\nUm, yeah, everything. [00:04:00] Dry rainforest, so we've got dry rainforest and a wet rainforest. So, can I just focus, come back, because we've got a real interest on Yarrawin. Yep. In terms of, I want to shoot them all. Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to hold them, I'm going to go, okay, oh well, now I'm going to manage them all.\n\nYeah. So, you've got a designated area where those things go, so they don't impact on the rest of the country. Yep. Brilliant. That's it. Brilliant. Yeah, that's the way. That is good. And then sea country. That is good. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. A great management. Has a great management. Well, I'll see you next time.\n\nCrazy. That's just our conference room. That's where we have all our meetings. Oh yeah. Okay. Projector. So everything goes. There's our map. And the island. Oh my lord. So that's only one island. So there's another one. Moreton Island. Yep. I see you manage Moreton too. Yes. So, we have about 10 rangers on Moreton Island now.\n\nThat are employed through Kayak, Edmund Campen. And they're full time rangers [00:05:00] that work over there. So we're still looking to employ more. So the good thing with Kayak is they only employ bloodline descendant people. They don't employ non Indigenous people because it's an Aboriginal organisation. We're there to empower our people and uplift them.\n\nIf someone else was wanting to work as a ranger, we'd tell them to apply for a job through Queensland Parks and Wildlife because Queensland Parks and Wildlife is still dictated by government and you can be built for benefit. But also we own Min Camping and Min Camping run all the campgrounds. So there's about 15 campsites along Flinders.\n\nAnd another 2, 000 sites along Main Beach. So we own, run and manage them. So we can also employ non Indigenous people to help manage them parts of Country as well. But for Kayak, for the Rangers through Kayak, and Moreton Island, we try to employ Indigenous people, Bloodline Descendants. Yeah. Because there's over 600 members for Kayak and 12 family.\n\nReps. Yep. So the head 12 family reps. Yep. And then your board, your CEO, [00:06:00] everyone else all filters down. Yeah. But the head honchos are them 12 family reps. Yeah. All the 12 family reps have all grandkids and kids and kids, you know, there's a big line of people there that need to get up and start getting shit done.\n\nYeah. Help benefit our people and get shit done for the future. Yeah. For the kids. That's how I see it. So everyone get up and do it, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Well, this is all mining weeks. But it all got handed back. Oh my god. So pretty much from here down was all mining leased. So no mines anymore? Nah, nah.\n\nBut it's still blocked off. A lot of it's still all locked off and you can't access it. Um, yeah. You've only got three roads. You've got one road that goes here out to Main Beach. Yeah. And that's it. You're allowed to cruise along the beach. And then you have the other road that goes out to Emmity Point.\n\nYeah. And then to Point Lookout. You can't go anywhere else off the track. There's only one more track that goes through the island here and that's you can that's the access for drive track for tourists Yeah, but you can't go off it and you can't go anywhere [00:07:00] else. Okay, so from here So now we're going into the future ecotourism mining is leaving Yeah, we've got to open up ground for tourists.\n\nYeah to visit but also access this cultural significant areas Yeah, so blue lakes men's sacred water like yeah We will open it up, but educate them not to swim in the lake. So now we've done 20Ks of walking tracks, all the way around. Um, it's World Heritage listed. So you can't send machines. We do. Yeah, they've got to be done by hand.\n\nSo you've got to GPS the tracks, and then go back through with mattocks, muddocks, and muck rakes, shovels, chainsaws, you name it. Yeah, all them tracks were done by hand. And now they're doing another track. We just did one out here near Tripod Hill. Now there's a track that's about 10 K's in here. And now they're doing another track out this way.\n\nSo yeah. 10 K? Yeah. Oh, all up, over, just the one here is [00:08:00] about 20 K's. This one's about 10 K's, and this one will probably be more. And they're still working on this one. They've still got about 800 metres left. Wow. All by hand, no machine. Yeah, no machine at all. Yeah, that's, that's to keep yourself fit. But everything from here, south, except the beach, has been, has not been accessed because of the mining lease.\n\nSo you have to have a mining permit, mining inductions, blah, blah, blah, whatever. So, in saying that, my father and a lot of old people have gone to their graves, not even allowed to access any part of country south of Dunnidge. So when government comes through and go, when are you going to open up the gate so we can all go down to the south end?\n\nOr when you get the followers on the, on the bay islands, when are you going to build a bridge across here so we can go to Australia? It's like, sorry, no fucking bridge coming here because my ancestors and my people didn't even get enough time to see that country. So we got to manage it and look after it.\n\nSo our people can go in there before we exploit it to [00:09:00] tourism and tourists. So yeah, still a lot of blocked off country. That, that's a great story. Um, I need my old people to hear that because you get pushed and pulled. Oh yeah. Yeah. But, um, yeah. Yeah. There's that much country that our mob haven't seen. So my thing is when they complain and go or what track are you going to open up for the tourists to go down?\n\nSo I looked at this track here, and this is an old track that used to run from Emberty point to point lookout So my idea was Open that track up. He's already fucked it all up. He's already ruined it all. Go and ruin that one again. Yeah, it's not hasn't been open for years. Yeah, instead of trying to create a whole new track down here and destroy good perfect land It's like I can't keep destroying the land.\n\nYou already destroyed. Yeah. Yeah, and instead of them instead of them swimming here We say go swim in the keyholes because this keyholes is man made from the mines. So the mines made this So it's like go destroy your man made lake. So yeah, [00:10:00] so what? Similarly, but not on this sort of level of scale. Yeah, we would do walking tracks and lead them away from places.\n\nYep. And then the other thing that we would do is, yeah, it's about auditing and making sure that, yeah, you know where those story places are. Yeah. Yeah, it's just, it's hard, hard bloody work. Yeah. But we always push. Yep, like we'll go through here. Our main threat's all in here, and that's a big swamp, 18 mile swamp.\n\nSo literally 18 miles long. So if a fire was to start here, it's not going to stop. If a fire starts anywhere in that swamp, it just all lights up. Yeah. And then it wraps around, and these are all little swampy edges off the edge of the island. Yeah. And these are all like swamp. So when the fire goes up on the island, it goes up bad.\n\nThat's why you always hear about it on the news, because Australia's just full of shit. Is this beech or mangrove? Nah, beach. Beach. Yeah, and then that's all, all um [00:11:00] So the swamps catch the runoff, huh? Oh yeah. There's paper barks, everything in that peat mine. It's all peat. Everything. So And then down here we've got our cypress camps.\n\nAnd boring. There's a boring and a cypress camp down along here. Okay. So the cypress trees down there are 500 to 1, 000 years old. So the trees wouldn't get that old unless someone maintained the land underneath them. Yeah. And that was our mob. And when the fire goes through, you see all the shells and stone artifacts under it.\n\nYeah. So it's class. So we've gone and down there with machines to mulch. Because all that growth for 50 years, I'm not looking after country. Yeah. So all them banksies have grown up for the last 50 years because we've all been stuck in town. Yeah. So now we send the rangers down there to go and take all that undergrowth out to save the cypresses.\n\nYeah. Cypress camps down there that look like rainforests though. Yeah. Cake is down there. That is fantastic. It's mad. Yeah, it's fantastic. Go out the back way, yeah, look, we'll go look for some more stuff. Wow. Look at how long you've had it for. Well, I'm going to have [00:12:00] two shots of this. I'm, I'm, I'm Youse off today or tomorrow?\n\nYeah, uh, today, but Here, look this way. You'll have to come back. I'm going to try and come back before Um, before. As you can see all our lockers, all our fire gear. Oh, sorry. You alright? Lockers. I'd love to get a fire. The stuff that our rangers. Yeah. I just say, where's our lockers? And they go, Oh, yeah, okay.\n\nThis makes it easier. Crazy, crazy, good. Someone's sitting here. How do you manage, how do you manage, um, uniforms and stuff? Um, I just buy them, order them and buy them. Have they got sort of like, okay, you get a certain amount, a certain amount given to you. And then after that, yeah. With Parks and Wildlife, it's all online.\n\nSo Parks and Wildlife are linked in with Workwear. So Workwear have their own [00:13:00] category, you're allowed, you know, eight shirts, eight long pants and then you've got all these other shirts and shorts and boots and everything. You just go and order it all and they send it back. With Kayak, they've got to put a order in, they get it, get it embroidered and send it back as well that way.\n\nOkay, cool. There you go. They've got their big fire bag. Yeah, yeah. Full of stuff. See, some of them have got wet shirts, so when we go out on warm water country. Yeah.\n\nOur boys want to go to the standards, but they've got all that bull. Ah, good job. Yeah, they got it, yeah. So all our Rangers at least have fire level one ticket. Yeah. So they can all go out and hit fire. Some of us have fire level two. Yeah. So that's crew leader, so you can run the whole sector. Yeah. And then some of us have the IC, so the incident control.\n\nEven runs that whole fire sector again. Wow. So that was the idea, was to not be dictated. By QFIS or other people coming [00:14:00] over when it comes to a fire ground telling us blackfellas what to do on the ground So it's like fuck this we go and train our mob up. Yeah to get them qualifications So when a fire happens, we run it we control it and they listen to us.\n\nYeah. Yeah, that's the big benefits there with that one Do you do cultural grounds now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so we mix the cultural stuff within Yeah, so we just don't, we just, they haven't given us authority to start nightburns, which I think is the money factor. But we need to work out a way this year where we can do more nighttime burns than we are daytime burns.\n\nYeah. Only because of that coolness in the, in the temperature. Yeah, we, on Palm Ridge, it's nighttime. Yeah. We light up in the afternoon and away you go. So this little thing in here, this is all the kayak gear. Right. So the kayak rangers and FIFA service rangers, they get their bit of money and they throw all their stuff in here.\n\nWill's over there servicing the saw now. How you going Will? How old are you Will? [00:15:00] 21. 21! Alright. My boys absolutely just drives me nuts. Nah, they're going to love it. Yeah, that's how all the chainsaws have got marks on it. So here's got kayak and it's got the 5037. Yeah, so that belongs in the truck 5037.\n\nYeah, specifically for that. And that's why he's cleaning it now because he's used, he's pulled it out of the truck, used it, and he's gonna go put it back. Yeah. Otherwise if you want to use one not out of the truck, there's Hunter here, all stuff. So you've got policy and procedure about. If you use it, you clean it straight away that day.\n\nIt has to be cleaned that day. Otherwise you can get growled by. Well, cause there's everyone around. We shit stir each other. Yeah. In a good way. So, you know, if it makes you want to do it next time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like, fucking go clean it now or you're going to lose your job. It's like, nah. And everyone just shit stirs each other.\n\nSo they end up getting it done. Nah, that's good. Yeah, in a good way. Yeah, I know. Yeah. We got a lot of young ones too. So the [00:16:00] young ones are good. They need to learn. So it's good for them to So work culture is, is a big, work culture is a good here. Yeah, good option. Yeah, everyone gets along well. Yeah.\n\nEveryone gets along then. How long did it take you to build that? Oh, it's always menia. Because we all grew up with each other on the island. We all know each other since we were all little kids. These boys, when I was little. Little, little, you know? These fellas would teach my kids. That's what's going to happen.\n\nI'm going to teach my kids, these fellas are going to teach my kids. And that's how we want it. Yeah, back out burner. I see you've got cameras. Yeah, yeah, we have. They're not so much for our rangers in case someone comes in to steal shit. Yeah. So your generator is under here? That's got our fire gear. The state's locked because some rangers like to take stuff without telling.\n\nYeah. But um, so with the fire gear we're talking clamps, hoses, attachments. Yeah. Everything's all in there. So we buy everything. So if something fucks [00:17:00] up we got it here ready to go. Yeah. That one there has all the Makita saws, everything Makita. Toolboxes, we're always buying new fucking toolboxes every year because tools go walkabout with blackfellas.\n\nYeah. Every Makita thing you can think of. Yeah. That's mainly for the platforms, walkways. You know, a little battery saw, if you don't want to use a petrol powered one, angle grinders. Okay. Everything. I've got, I've got a storeman here, um, William, I need to send down there and spend some time. Yep. You can't, you can't tell them, you get someone to show them, then they can model.\n\nYeah. Do you have trucks like these? Sorry, we haven't got, I live on, we've got eight islands to look over, we haven't even got a boat, so, yeah, crazy. Ah, this is good. But that's also, see [00:18:00] that? That's a table, you pull the table out, and you've got a table to do your servicing. Oh, okay, fair enough. 300 litre tank, or this one I think is a bit bigger.\n\nSo that's QPWS standard? Yep, this one is, yeah. And we try and get the kayak cars exactly the same. Yeah. They might have a different pump set up. Yeah. So that car over there, that's a kayak car. That one. So, so he looks after your, um, in terms of the standard of work truck. Every, as, as Toyota, he, he does that for you.\n\nNah, we got a mechanic just up the road here, Rick Lewis. Yeah. I'll take his up there in a minute. Yeah. So Rick Lewis just up the road, he does all the, Like if there's something wrong, we send it straight to him. He fixes it, get back on the road again. Okay. So today you had to fix two of the fire trucks up, the pumps weren't working too good.\n\nYep. But that's the same with Kayak as well. Kayak and MBD, if they have something wrong, we just send it straight up to Rick Lewis. Yeah. And he's our fabricator, mechanic, slash everything. Yep, the lighting setup. [00:19:00] Yeah, they are good. Yeah. This one, this is a good truck because it's got all the switches here.\n\nSee?\n\nOh, ho, ho.\n\nThey fixed it. That was the problem. This here was, wasn't working.\n\nThat's all more fly hoses and attachments. [00:20:00] Ah, yeah. So\n\nit says, you, you can hold 300, 300 litres. Yep. Yeah, 300 litres in that little back lip. F k me. It's got the chainsaws. This side of the issue though. What's in there? Oh, yeah. Tools, your toolbox. Cleaning stuff. And whatever else you want to put in there. Yeah, nice. Yeah, it's good the single cabs are good. You can store everything on them.\n\nSingle cabs, not dual. Yeah, OK, gotcha. You can hold more water on it too. Yep.\n\nFuck.\n\nYou got washing machines and dryers in there for your Yeah. [00:21:00] bits and pieces. And there's a freezer. They bought a big giant freezer there. Wow. For, it's a biohazard one. So, sometimes you get called in or you get animals Yep. that have, um, been attacked by dogs. Yep. And you need to keep it to send back over town for forensics.\n\nYep, yep. Because we're on a remote island. Yeah. So we'll freeze them, put them in a garbage bag, freeze it and put it in there until Okay. until they want it over town. Right.\n\nSo, in terms of training, tell me about KPWS training standards and Training? Yeah. Oh, training whenever we're not doing fires. Yep. So, we just finished our coxswains. Yeah. So I just finished that. Um, compliance training, whatever training we need, they'll get it done ASAP. Yeah. Yeah. Fire. Everything. I've just done the drone course.\n\nYep. So some of us can fly drones up to 25 kilos. Yep. And that's with the thermo imaging. Yep. And I use them for koalas before we [00:22:00] do burns. Okay. They go spotting koalas. Right. Excellent. So they're two parks machines. Okay. That's, we've still got two more of these on Peel Island, so Peel Island's the island out in the middle.\n\nYeah. And it's just easier to get around on. Yeah. These are used to get into some of the cypress camps, because we can't drive our four drives in there. Yeah. This one was used for swamps, because it's an amphibian, you can drive it straight into the water. That's why this is here, for the motor. Yeah. You take the tank out, so this tank comes out, there's two little seats in the back.\n\nPut a motor on the back of this and drive straight into the water and it floats. So it's an amphibian Mad machine this one. Yeah, so with the large swamp area We're breaking the swamp up into three sections or four sections This here can help make a track straight through the swamp Yeah And then keep running over that track and then you can cut that swamp in the sections and burn off In little areas instead of having a whole [00:23:00] swamp burn Have it burnt off in little sections And this is the machine to help get through the swamp.\n\nOkay. Where the other ones won't get through it. Yeah. Yeah. That's a community boat. So the land council bought that like 15 years ago. Help me out. Community boat. What do you mean by that? Anyone in the community can buy it. You can have a, not buy it, but use it. Yeah. To go hunting for turtle, whatever. Yeah.\n\nMaybe if you want to go fishing. So me and my kids have been, we were using that over the Christy holidays. Yeah. There's a big tube in there. So I've been towing around on the tube. Yeah. So yeah, community boat, but you gotta have a bit more, a bit of experience out of being driving boats, like you can't just take it if you just got your boat license.\n\nYeah. So yeah, we're, who's got a key? I need a key. I'll see if Bailey's still here. Let me ring him. We'll keep going around here while I'm waiting to get a key for this gate, this big thing here. We might have to bounce in like 10 as well. Yeah, okay. Hey? We might have to bounce in about 10 minutes. Yep.\n\nWe're gonna [00:24:00] do the 2. 30 barge. Oh, lucky. Yeah, we're going to do a lap around here and we're done. The boats are in that shed, so I'm going to ring someone, but we've got a couple of machines around here. That's a mulcher, an 18 inch mulcher, one of the biggest mulchers you can buy. Yeah,\n\nthere Uncle Darren's, he's redoing this one up. So using that from parts. Okay. Are you on base? Oh, are you gone? Yeah, of course. When are you coming back? Never? Oh, I'll see you when you get back. Righto. See ya. Righto. That's a steam weeder. So we want to try and get out of chemicals used for weeds. Can you repeat that again?\n\nSteam weeder? Steam weeder. It's um, [00:25:00] used for Yeah. So instead of using chemicals, this will produce hot water, and the hot water will kill your weeds. Yeah. So any weeds that are around, it's got the big hoses on the back, 60 metre hoses. Wow. Goes through here, goes into the big boiler, at a certain temperature, will, will kill any weeds you can think of.\n\nYeah. So, yeah, 50, 000 machine. With the two hoses on the back of it, so. Wow. And being on an island, that's what we're trying to do, is get away from using chemicals on spraying, anything on country, and use the steam heater because it's just straight hot water. And it doesn't affect anything. Wow. And these should have,\n\nSo they're all the different attachments. So if you're attacking big weeds, smaller weeds, and if you want to get asparagus, Because asparagus it's hard to get in, that, get into the crown, and just hit it with the steam weeder, and you're laughing, and that'll kill it. [00:26:00] So that's the way to go. Plus, I reckon, if you get a hold of one of these, same, because we're on the island now, so if we got this, we can dictate to Raelyn City Council, and other agencies, that look to go and spray chemicals on country, we can dictate and tell them, no, no more spraying chemicals, we've got a steam weeder, you can employ us.\n\nContract us to go and do the weed work for you. Otherwise they'll go buy a steam weeder, then you have two steam weeders on an island. So we've got to tap into that. I want this to tap in with the, they've got a girls rangers crew coming up soon. So as a main in source for the fee for service rangers.\n\nThis is going to be an in source for them to keep their money rolling until they've got employed. So if they can get a contract off everyone for this, then that's one source of income for fee for service. Very clever. Very clever. Probably, uh, they're like a fuel container, aren't they? What's that? Ah, nah, that's just our storage ones.\n\nSo she can store, yeah, anything. I think [00:27:00] one's kayaks, one's Oh, yeah, one is fuel. Um, so What's this, what's this used for? Polities. No, no, the bloody skid, skid steer. Yeah, skid steer. So, there's two of them. So Kayak bought two min campers, got one, and there's one on Moreton Island for the Moreton crew. What do you use this for?\n\nMulching our tracks. Mulching your tracks. Mulching tracks, fire tracks, fire trails, track maintenances, you name it. So you've got the big mulcher on the front. They also got a, they got a excavator with a six metre boom on it with a mulcher on it as well. So that can do hillsides. So this one's flat ground.\n\nThen anything on the hillsides, we send the excavator through with the arm, and then he hits the hillsides. And that's the way to go. Okay. Oh yeah. And then we, and then after that's done, then we just use the tractors, and the tractor slashers to maintain everything. Okay. [00:28:00] Heavy lifting and Fuck. That's crazy good stuff.\n\nI don't think this is open. Nah, key locked. I left my keys in the bloody other truck and the girls took it. Okay. Well, it just means that I'll send you photos of the boat when they come through. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we've got two boats in here. One's a mini barge that can fit the side by side on. So literally put the ramp down.\n\nA mini barge. And you can drive the side by side on it. And the other one's a big inflatable boat for the elders. So it was mainly, it's like a fisheries and a police boat. Yeah. A big inflatable one. So that was used for the elders to get them off and off on the beaches with the ramp at the front. Yep. And now we just upgraded to another boat that's going to be here next year.\n\nOkay. About, yeah, nearly a million dollar boat. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a [00:29:00] fully closed and cabin one. So when you come to the boat, um, in terms of QPW, okay, I'll keep banging on back to that. So. So do you put, how does that work? Like you get a certain amount of dollars. Yep. To bloody run your main, your operations.\n\nBut if you need capital expenditures, do you have to apply for it? Or you put a request in? How does that work for you? I think we put a request in for what we want. Yeah, that's another boat. That was our NAIDOC day. Is that a stabie? Do that again. Oh, okay. It's in there. Yeah, it's got wheels on it. Shit, man.\n\nYeah. That's the one for you, you just fail. Then you just go straight into the water. Dale, look. That thing looks like a little airplane. Yeah, pretty much.[00:30:00] \n\nThat's so cool. Have you done, um, any other sort of cultural exchanges with other rangers in Queensland? Uh, we've been up to Bunya Mountains. We do the senior ranger indigenous programs over town. But nothing, no one's really come to the island to do one yet. So it needs to happen. When the palm moth come, it'll be the first time.\n\nYeah, that pretty much will be the first time. Yeah. You go up to the palm. Oh, they'll love it. There's plenty here for them to do. Well, I think it, it's not so much also one with one visit having, having the elders, then the other would be to, for us to then program it. Yep. So we talked to our in indigenous, um, range of program and I said, look, I, I, I need our guys to be, it's one thing to be in the mainstream space.\n\nIt's another thing to be taught. Different sort of standards and that kind of stuff by your own, and Yeah, that's right. Cause you just, [00:31:00] you just lift your game, sort of thing. Whereas you, some of the times the boys are just going, Ah, F him, you know, because of that race stuff, and you go, Oh, they gotta get that out of their head.\n\nYou gotta get, nah, you can't do that boys. Nah. I'm trying to see if I've got the photo of these other boats here. Yeah. Saw a cool, um, Iveco Daily 4x4 this morning. Where's that? One of your rain shoes. Oh, yeah. He's going out in it. Yeah, we've got to swap that over, eh? Nah, some belt keeps breaking in on the front of it.\n\nSo we keep getting it fixed. So we're going to get a new one. But I don't think they should get another Iveco. They should just get a Land Cruiser. Because we're always struggling for, for fucking cars. That's like this morning we were struggling for cars. Nah, I can't even fortify it, eh. So the Iveco, you didn't learn?\n\nOh, I tried it off the drive. It's too big. Too bumpy and, yeah. Well, some of the rangers love it. So they, [00:32:00] yeah, they like it, but I don't. Ah, okay, cool. Yeah, when I get photos, I'll send them to you on that boat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, they're pretty big. So, yeah, again, the idea was just to touch base, sail low and have a look, see?\n\nYep. The other thing was, we're hoping to come back in February, March. Yep. I mean, we're hoping to bring elders and some, some rangers and do a few things instead for, you know, three, four days, something like that. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and um, and then connect in. How many are you hoping to bring down? Uh, it would, yeah, it'll probably be, uh, two senior staff.\n\nYep. And maybe, um, and some elders, um, elder rangers. Yeah, yeah. You know, initially. Yep. And then, and then that, then. Um, those, they will then start to hatch a plan about what would this look like in terms of maybe even formalising something. Yep. That, that we, that is done on a regular basis. Yeah, cause we'll take you for a drive down the south then.\n\nYeah. To them [00:33:00] Cypress camps. Where they've been working and. Yeah. Other places on the island and even if we can get our senior boat in and take him out on the boat for a cruise. Yeah. So one of the islands or something. Yeah. And I know that every man and his dog will wanna, um, come but I think. If we can just manage that so we're mobile.\n\nYeah, yeah, that's right. And then that way then we can plan accordingly and then Yep. And the goal will be that in my headspace, we've said to the guys, look, I want you to go and potentially do a, um, either of 'em 10 day or a month stint in another spot. Yep. Um, yeah. And, but yeah, and, and I've talked to the department saying about and they just went, yeah, absolutely.\n\nYeah. That's it. You know, and if, if one of the social benefits is that you have people from that country who have been removed, who are connecting to their own story, yeah, that's right, that's crazy. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. No, Australia's a good, good example and [00:34:00] a lot we can offer a lot of, a lot of people in a big way.\n\nYeah. And then the other part then, our senior Natalie, I'd love to be able. Like, who manages your backend, your, in terms of your administration and that kind of stuff? Yeah, in the shade, go this side. That's not you, is it? Nah, I was doing it. Nah, we've got other people that are in there. Yeah. That can help feed, feed your information there.\n\nYeah, yeah. Yeah. So Natalie would love to be in that. My senior would love to, yeah, just spend a week here and just get energized. Yeah, that's right. See what's going on and take it back home. Yeah, yeah, so that's a good. Yeah I always say it's good motivation for the younger ones. Yeah. Especially the younger lazy ones, that wanna do stuff.\n\nWhat did you do today, Leroy? Nah, that's not work. Ha ha ha ha ha. Alright, get in here, get that dog.[00:35:00] \n\nWho the fuck is, oh there's a dog. Oh crap, yeah yeah yeah. He was running down that person again. Ha ha ha ha. Nah, Stradi's good. The good thing here with Parcs is, they get better help. Where some parks over town, they got nothing. Because we got an Aboriginal Land Council and parks, they can get everything and anything.\n\nOh wow. So if they want a new car, or if they want a new boat, and they can justify it, like elders need it, whatever, you know, blah, blah, blah. And if kayak don't have enough money, then parks can throw in half. State government can throw in a third of it. Oh, so you just, oh my gosh. It's got three ways in it.\n\nYeah. It's smarter, not harder. Oh, wow. And that's why I try to tell it, Morton Island, because Morton Island had national parks over there too. And they didn't want, it took us five years to get our claim on Morton Island. Yeah. Because the park rangers over there didn't want nothing to do with the native titles and Aboriginal people.\n\nWhich boat are you on? This one or near the barge? Uh, the one near the barge. The, uh, [00:36:00] Sea Week one. Yep. Yeah, so it took over five years because them fellas didn't want nothing to do with blackfellas coming to take over country. Yeah. And I tried telling them, I was like, yeah. Because they were scared their jobs were going to get missed out.\n\nI said, you're not going to lose your job. I said, you'll have your same job, don't worry about that. I said, but you see that tractor? How old is that tractor? Oh, it's old, it's shit and all this. I said, don't you want a new tractor? Well, what do you mean? So if you link up with Kayak and the Aboriginal Land Council, I said we'll go halves on a brand new tractor for this island, and you've got a brand new tractor.\n\nI said, but if you want to carry on like an idiot, I said, we'll just leave that shitty tractor here for you and you'll get nothing. So now they're starting to realize. Yeah. Oh shit, we better work in with these fellas. We get new equipment. Yeah. And when we first started the Ranger Base, we used to get all the hand me down stuff from the mainland.\n\nYeah. So they used to send us all the second hand stuff from the mainland, but now it's turned around. It's like, nah, we get all the brand new stuff and we give them all our hand me down stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's the way you want it. Yeah. [00:37:00] Yeah. At the end of the day, that's all our government money, you know, that's all natural resources.\n\nWe should be entitled to do what we've got to do with it, any way we have to. Yeah, well, see we've got this indigenous ranger program, and I just go, well, I'll fund them to the level of QPWS. And they go, yeah, well you've got to train them. We're looking up to the same country. So, Rich, do we need to grab, um, do you mind if we go to the, um, rec center?\n\nYou know, the recreational accommodation just here on the right?

      "Transcript": "Okay, you just tell me your name, Jerry, and can you spell it for me? Your name and spell it? Okay. Well, say your name and then spell your name. My name is Jerry Pasovsky. J-I-R-I Pasovsky. P-A-S-O-V-S-K-Y for Yankee. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Well, I come to Australia on the 9th of January, 1997. Retired mining engineer. Drove taxi spot there to the east. Oh, I sparred only in the real estate firm. I think this is not working. This is so bad. I may have pressed the button. Oh, yeah. Geez, Jerry. Okay. Okay, kick off. Tell me about yourself. I come to Australia on the 9th of January, 1970. Couldn't speak English. I knew only six words in English, yes, no, thank you, and John Wayne. Two years later, I was at WIU. 1974, I was at Calgary School of Mines. In 1978, I graduated at Calgary School of Mines in two disciplines. Had an awesome time in the mining industry up north. Happened to manage the second largest gold mining plant in Australia. When I left the mining industry, I became the part owner in the real estate firm in my lane. I was a part-time, or partner, shall we say. Right around about 1991, I started driving taxis for some 30 years. Now I'm retired, 80 years of age, and just about the size of it. And why do you use only Sky? We never know what's around the corner. How do you do that? At one stage, I was heading to be a wealthy man. I had about 10 real estate properties to my name. Today, I've got only half of the house, and my ex-wife is still in it. I was sometime homeless. Now I'm renting property in Armadale. And what do you think of our new Sky? What do you what? What do you think of our new Sky and what they do? Great. Young, young cheque from Queensland. As I said, I used to be a volunteer for them about eight years ago. And, yeah, great stuff. Why do you think it's good for people to be able to wash their clothes and hang out at Orange Sky? Why is it good that Orange Sky is here to help? Why is it good for people? Well, I suppose the health and hygiene are one of the most important things. Also, it gives the homeless people to interact with other individuals. And that's all I can say. You look at me again, I missed you. And what do you think of the volunteers at Orange Sky? Volunteers? Well, I'm volunteering myself somewhere else. So I've got no problem. It hasn't been a long time. As a matter of fact, a long time ago, a long time ago, I never really believed in volunteering. I was of the opinion when I, a politician, become a volunteer, I'd be one also. Thank you for asking. What's next for you? What's going to happen next for you, I think? What are you hoping? Um. Well, I'm going to plan what to do with my name, 110. Okay. Whether I'll be last that long, I don't know. I've been always relatively healthy, first 40 years in Australia, even though working 16 to 18 hours a day. I've never had one sick a day. I'm going to try to get better. I'm going to try to get better. I'm going to try to get better every day. Currently I'm battling with cardiovascular disease. Forty nine ago, I nearly died, arriving in the hospital ED, with blood pressure 34 over nothing, or very little. I've got the installed defibrillator in my chest. Very little. I've got this there. Well, I don't know, I don't know. I'm just talking about myself. So, I'm ready to start. I'm part of this. I'm working. So, I'm ready to go. I want to see you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm not planning to meet you, but I'm sure I'll be. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. I don't know why I was driving too well.\n",

A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Even for this guy down there with the, doing the tricks or whatever with the slingy. There's hope for him. Cool, man. Are you going to stand there, you reckon? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. Cool. I'll get you crispy in this frame. Maybe come one little step. Sure, man. And stop. That's great. Oh, that's just mine. I know. Sound rating. Sound rating or whatever. Yeah, right. Yeah. All right, man. Tell me your name and spell it would be awesome. Sure. And you can just look at me. Yeah. Okay. My name's Luke. L-U-K-E. Cool. And what's your last name? Napier. N-A-P-I-E-R. Wicked. Yes. Tell us a tiny little bit about yourself, Luke. I'm nearly 40 years old. I've been doing Orange Sky volunteering here for the past year. For the past five years, I've been a born again Christian. That is a major part of my life. Prior to that, I did not have a life. I'm self-employed. I work for myself. This is for me doing this type of thing is actually so it's much more than the laundry. It's making connections, actually hearing what people need. And yeah. How'd you hear about Orange Sky? So four years ago, I was a student at the University of New York. I was a student at the University of New York. I was working Ligturismo for basically two years. And I did my business there. I ran the business, and then I, I was at my business Klein City. fellowship plan three years ago at my church. We were going to do a laundry and shower truck service. survey stuff because I was like wanting to volunteer with SES and the whatever I had I'd said that I wanted to do as far as like you know my because it goes with the questionnaire of do you like to help people do you like to be hands-on this and that this and that and eventually it said oh we found something suitable for you laundry sir and laundry with this and I was like with my spiritual belief I was like wow lord you know you brought me back to the laundry and once upon a time I also worked in the laundry so seems laundry is part of where I'm meant to be and I do love the spiritual thing about it is that me with my faith Jesus washes us until we have salvation you know our faith is the belief is that people are kind of um how to say look not in any way of finger pointing at people but we we are dirty in in in ways of the world and not holy basically and Jesus washes us clean allows us to have a fresh start um a new start um that's the best thing about Jesus and and his hope is that you know he gives us a new start and I love that that's with the laundry is it's washing clothes it's you know you know washing our the garments for people to to be clean again it's very it's cool like that now like this isn't a hugely deep thing but I do like the little um the little kind of roundabout ways um you know things that like this always seem to happen for me yeah that's cool man that's cool um what keeps you coming back to Orange Sky what are the special things about it that can keep you excited about um about doing this stuff um so I do like uh I'll be out on the streets um doing ministry out on the streets as well so I do make connections with people um when they see me here as well they um it just helps really build the create uh build more of a relationship with people so they actually see more elements of helping them other than just being out on the streets um some a lot of homeless people I shouldn't say a lot some of the homeless people don't take street ministers too seriously they think that they're just coming out for one reason but then coming here they also see yes this guy is actually doing stuff helping us like this so it just gives me a little bit um better leverage so to speak um to as far as building relationships with them where they have trust um Orange Sky releases podcasts with the F word and the F word with friends yeah can you conceptualize that idea of friendship not just in what Orange Sky does but in your own life as well what's the power of friendship yeah um 100% for me the meaning of life is relationships with people we were not created to be alone um you know loving your loving one another helping one another um my belief with what the bible says is that um there's no greater love than to lay one's life down for his brother for his friend um so that's the power of friendship yeah but it's one of my biggest credences in life yeah yeah um what so tell us a little bit about like this is quite a unique Orange Sky service can you sort of explain how it works with Tranby and the Washington one sure um so Tranby is you know one of the um main homeless subs here in Perth um there's a few other you got More Street which has the mobile service Ruawah I don't know uh there's Ruawah over in Northbridge as well so this is a one of the primary services surprising us places for the guys to come to. Washing is incredibly important. There are people who you know are on the street just through bad circumstances sometimes and are trying their best to say get work and they need to have clean clothes for and showers for job interviews this type of stuff. It's an incredibly important service to help those people and just for people to have a little bit of self respect definitely. What would you say to people who are thinking about volunteering but not sure or like the elements that they're scared about or worried about? Don't worry. Absolutely don't worry. And don't feel that you can't volunteer enough. Whatever you can do time-wise even if it's once a year that makes a huge difference. If 50 people volunteered once a year that's 50 times more than you can do. 50 extra weeks you know 50 shifts covered so every little bit counts from everybody 100% can't stress that enough. You're always watched. You've got your communication with each other so that's always safe. You build up rapport with the friends as well so you gauge what's you know who you can be more relaxed around who to be mindful of but always be respectful and courteous and that kind of covers your butt. Don't stress but don't stress just volunteer. You know it's it's yeah. Very like so I've been trying to recruit for here and it's you know because we need we need volunteers. Yeah I hope that's why you're here is to help try and get volunteers. Yeah. I think story is one of the most powerful tools right. Yeah. To convey. Yeah. Messaging. Anything else you wanted to say. Yeah don't actually underestimate what we're doing here. There's a lot of things that we can do. The connections that we do make here like when I say don't underestimate I mean for the people whoever's going to read this or watch it whatever. It is definitely making a difference in a big way. You might not always see it immediately but down the track you will see it. You'll see the difference in people's lives and there's no great yeah really honestly this is time well worth well spent. Well worth doing. It's very easy to live for ourselves but it's much more rewarding to live for someone else and to help someone else giving your time. You know we touched on time today and time your time can't be given or taken. So when you give your time for somebody else that's one of the biggest things that you can do. Yeah. Right. Okay. Well done mate. Cool man.\n",

She oversees van operations and the multipurpose center, offering laundry facilities. Marilee's background in international relations and psychology led her to this work to help address the needs of homeless individuals in Greece.",

      "Transcript": "Arillie - Ithaca\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nDJI\\_20250321175913\\_0040\\_D: Tell me your name and spell it for me would be great too. Okay, perfect. So I'm Marilee, M-A-R-I-L-L-I-E. Amazing. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about, uh, yourself and your role, um, here. Okay. So here I'm the operations coordinator. So I'm responsible for the van and for the employees of the van. So the employees of the van are people who come from vulnerable backgrounds.\n\nUh, so I mean. In charge of helping them reintegrate and helping them with their, their everyday tasks. Uh, I'm also in charge of the multipurpose center for the homeless, and we have their five washing machines, a five drying machine, so I'm in charge for the smooth operation of the center. Amazing. Um, what draws you to this type of work?\n\nLike why do you do this work? So, uh, I studied international relations and also had a minor in psychology. And I decided that I really wanted to do something that has to do with people. And because [00:01:00] here in Greece we have so many, uh, homeless people that they don't have any services. I thought that this initiative was amazing and I was really excited of participating.\n\nSo I had my internship here, uh, and now I, I work here. Amazing. Um, tell us a little bit about what it's like on shift here. Like what, what does happened just then, this experience? Yeah. Uh, so here people come, they know the, the spot because of word of mouth. They, we've been here operating for many years, so people know it.\n\nSo they come and they bring the bags with the clothes, uh, and we put numbers on each bag so that we know for which person is. Uh, wet bag, and then we put them on the washing machines. We wash them right on the spot and then on the drying machines, and we dry them, and then we give them, we give them back.\n\nOf course, there, there are some problems, uh, during the sift of course, because there are people who, who really want to wash. But if we have, for example, 25 people, then we won't be able to. [00:02:00] To help more people. So sometimes there is a bit of tension, but, but it's going well. What's the interaction like with people who use the van?\n\nUm, it's really nice. Um, as I've told you, of course there are people who with many different backgrounds and they come here and sometimes they, they may have tensions between them and they don't get in fights, but. They, they have tension. So we have to be very careful on keeping, uh, the same rules every day, uh, in terms with the line and who's gonna take priority or not.\n\nOf course it's difficult, but with just empathy and understanding, I think it's What bit of conversations happen around the van do you think? Ah, it depends. Every day. Some people just come and talk about their days. Of course. Uh, we also have a social worker here who, who helps them. Today's is not here, but we have Tuesdays and [00:03:00] Thursdays, the social worker, the conversations, um, as I can recall today, for example, uh, a gentleman came and he just started saying that he's going to the beach today because it's a really sunny day.\n\nSo you see like every type of of conversations and of course, that it's a really important service that we have here. Uh, and we get a lot of thank you every day. Amazing. So there's, uh, some people here from different parts of the world today. Yeah. We're talking about this thing of a what this idea of a global type mm-hmm.\n\nAlliance of people coming together looks like. What's your, what's your take on what that is and the opportunity? Yeah. I think that a lot of people forget that hygiene and clean clothes are very important for, for people because we also, we always. Talk about other services that they should have access to.\n\nBut we always forget that clean clothes is the, the first step for reintegrating into society. Because if they don't have clean clothes, of course they're not gonna get interviews. For example, [00:04:00] they, they won't be able to operate in everyday lives. So I think that it's. Important to raise awareness on how important it is to, to have, uh, clean clothes, to, to, to be hygienic in order to, to have dignity in general in your, your life.\n\nAnd what difference do you think having, um, a group of people from all around the world talking about this around Just one, I think, yeah. The important thing is to, to raise awareness globally because yes, we do it here. Uh, we were the first, uh. Laundry unit in Europe. Uh, and we understand from that that this is not very well known and it's not something that people think about.\n\nSo if there's a huge group of people worldwide, I think it's gonna raise more awareness, advocacy, and then. Hopefully more initiatives like that, uh, will be in the world. Cool. And have you, um, learned much about the other groups yet here, or is today that, that you're, uh, yes. I think today, uh, I wanna [00:05:00] meet you all and listen to, to what you do.\n\nUh, I have a glimpse of that, but I just wanna meet you today and talk about it. Amazing. Uh, is there anything else you wanted to say we missed or something important topic that I, uh, no, just like, uh, I'm really excited about today. I. Think it's, uh, it's very important because you see, we, we have this here and it's, uh, it's a small community of people.\n\nOf course, we cannot help as many people as we wish to. Uh, so I think that it's, it's, it's very, very important and I'm really glad that you guys are here. Amazing. Well done. Well spoken.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "Michael Quinn\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nOh yeah, that should be fine.\n\nAll right. So you just have to look at me. You don't have to worry about this. This is just like there, but fine. And let's start with your full name.\n\nI've got a clap too. Or his, oh, I've got microphone in here because means that I can't actually hear you. Oh, okay. That'd be a, that'd be a schoolboy error. It would be. Alright. I think we'll have to start again. Okay. Okay. My name is Michael Quinn. I'm 81. I was born in East Africa, came to Australia in 1962 when I was 18.\n\nAnd, I had a wonderful life so far, so good. How do you spell, is it Quinn? [00:01:00] QUI double N. Yeah, it is amazing. Tell me a little bit about how, what got you to Tom net? What was the journey to coming here? I had a marriage breakup in da. I'd lived in Darwin for 45 years and I had a marriage breakup, which meant that I have to leave town basically.\n\nAnd I came to Toowoomba because I had a daughter who lived in Crows Nest at the time, and she was the only relative I have who had a house with a spare bedroom. So I moved in there for a couple of months and that didn't work mutually to both of our advantages. So I started looking around town for a place to live over a period of months, rented a couple of commercial units.\n\nAnd eventually I managed to get a place in a retirement village run by the Church of Christ called a CC Court. And at the time, one of the members that was there since died, but there was two other members of Tom Net there, [00:02:00] and they said, why don't you come along and see what we do? Tom Net took me long as a guest and I, I liked the idea of having a men's group that you could relate to.\n\nAnd I joined up about two and a half years ago. Yeah. What are the things that keep you coming back to Tom then? The companionship that you, I come every Tuesday morning usually. And it's a nice group of men, most of 'em just ex farmers and things that I've not done anything, had anything to do with farming, but it's nice to hear how their lives went and, there's been some very useful people to know who've been in Toowoomba most of their lives. So you want to know where to get something or how to get something fixed. They're the guys to see. And yeah, it's just a companionship and it becomes a fixture in your calendar, every week, Tuesday morning, top net.\n\nDon't make any doctor's appointments or anything else, Toni. And from that, of course, I've volunteered for. Go, we'd go around to men's [00:03:00] homes, aged men's homes, talk to the guys there, just shoot the breeze, introduce ourselves. We run a barbecue at the BMS hardware shop once a month, raise money, sell sausage sandwiches just like Bunnings.\n\nAnd they're just activities which are enjoyable to do, so I have a cousin who lives in Mulbar and I go and visit her every out now and then. But I've got a son and a daughter in Toowoomba, so I've got a little bit of family here and I like, although I don't like the weather's too cold for me compared to being in Darwin for most of your life.\n\nBut I like Tom net and I like the attitude of the people here. And it's more interesting than a men's shed type of thing where you need to make things. I had a stroke. And I can't use my left arm. I enjoy it for that reason, that it's a sort of men's group without the tools, if you like, and they're a nice bunch of people.\n\nAnd if you ever wanted any help, this is the sort of place you need to be a member of to get it. [00:04:00] Yeah. What are the, some of the things that some of those fellows in community that aren't coming to Tom Net are facing, do you think? What are the challenges that Derman face. I think if they're in an aged care residence type of place they are very much restricted to their room and the immediate surrounds from that room knowing to the dining room or the toilet, or that's their world, so along we come and it's a nice sunny day. We'll go sit out in the garden outside. Most of the retirement villages are quite well set up, and sometimes they've they've had a bit of a barbecue lunch, which we didn't cook. The girls there cook it and it's just nice to get sit and chat to 'em and they meet more people.\n\nIt gives them people skills, which. At their age is deteriorating greatly, but I quite enjoy it. I spent 30 [00:05:00] years in Darwin being a potter as a hobby. We had a number of hobby businesses and I'm giving a talk here in a couple of weeks. I'm showing some slides on pottery and talking about pottery.\n\nSo that's the sort of contact you have with people, I had a very interesting aviation background, which I'm mostly gonna talk about. So it just helps to broaden your knowledge of the people here and they know, likewise get to know you a bit better, which is nice. Tell me a bit more about the aviation stuff.\n\nWhat's that? I was with air Traffic Services, which is an offshoot of air traffic control. Where they provide a communications and search and rescue watch on aircraft all around Australia. Wow. Controllers look after the stuff around the airports. Yeah, we, I did that in Cairns, Townsville, Weipa, Gove, Catherine in the territory.\n\nDarwin, yeah. It was it was a great [00:06:00] job. Yeah. How do some of those experiences get shared in on there? Do you have the ability apart? Yeah. Apart from just having a conversation. If somebody asks, what did you do when you were in, in Darwin? There is the opportunity to give a talk, a more formal talk with photos to back up your background.\n\nWhich I suppose most men's clubs would've something like that, but. Not nowhere that I've been before has got it like it is here. It's very good. Anthony's a very knowledgeable person, so yeah. He'll help you with anything technical. Are there certain activities that you go out and do in community you like more than others in terms of the school or other things?\n\nWhat are the ones? No. I'm, I don't mind going to the old people's homes, although it's quite difficult sometimes to talk to some guys there. Reticent talk. But there are a number of other activities we take part in. We do helping at some schools with some of the kids that are, [00:07:00] have done their driving license test and they need to build up their hours on the road.\n\nSo we will go for driving tests. I haven't been doing that, but that's another quite an interesting thing. Yeah, that's about my limit at the moment. Bearing in mind, I've only been in here a couple of years, so yeah. But I thoroughly enjoy it. It's it's a very pleasant place to come.\n\nHow diverse are the experiences of people here? Do you, is it, do you think there's similar people are drawn to this or are there lots of diverse characters? Oh, no, they're all diverse. Although there is a. A, a significant in influence of people who used to be farmers at Morey. There's probably a third of the members here are retired farmers.\n\nBut there's a number of different people who had occupations. There's one guy used to work for Casio as a salesperson, installing, adding machines and that sort of thing in shops and businesses. Yeah, so there's quite a [00:08:00] variety of people. Some of them are happy to talk about their past. Some of 'em are a bit quiet, bit reserved, but it's certainly a big influence of the farming community, not only Moree, but around this part of the world.\n\nAnd they'll often tell you about the various tractors they've driven and how much they cost to the price of land and how the weather is something that influences you every day as a farmer. Whether they're gonna get rain next year or all this, but I think they're a nice bunch of people.\n\nYeah. What do you think people need to know more about Tom led in the community? 'cause I think at the club there, I think they were saying that maybe not a lot of people know about yet. What do you think people should know about? I think it needs to be promoted on the media a bit more.\n\nProbably that could help with advertising. When we do the barbecues at BMS in Stenner Street we always have a few pamphlets out on the table. People walk over and say, [00:09:00] who are you guys with? What are you raising money for? All this sort of thing. So we tell 'em, and we usually try and get a pamphlet to them and if they're an elderly person.\n\nSomebody that looks like they might be approaching or are just retired, we give 'em a come, do see us and have a chat and tell us about it and join up with Tomland. And often a very positive response. I can only say since I've been here, there's been probably seven or eight people join up as new members.\n\nYeah, that's cool. The word is getting around and they do have. I think Anthony and Shannon do something on the radio, although I haven't heard it. I've heard 'em talking about it. But I think a bit more publicity from the media and they obviously need to work out how they get supported financially.\n\nYes. What are the things in which you would say support you and [00:10:00] all the followers here that would like. Almost be able to tell that story about why this is important. I don't know. I dunno how other than having some sort of camera person follow you around when you go to these activities and take some shots of you actually selling sausage sandwiches to people at BMS on a Saturday morning, that type of thing. I dunno that there's much else really you can do except send out lots of pamphlets and letterbox drops and those sort of things.\n\nI think I dunno much about the financial background of Tom and how they, but I know they get government grants and we had a new organization, a new group start in Gatten recently and, we had a big barbecue day there and public were invited and some of the gatten residents came and that sort of thing.\n\nAnd looks like there's quite a small but positive group of men [00:11:00] there. Instant forming a, an a branch of Tom. And a couple of the guests were fairly high up in the Queensland government. I don't know whether they were ministers or minister for social services or what, but they came along and to see them developing this sort of, friendship amongst men.\n\nSo I went away quite positive about the future for the finance side of it. But that's outta my league. I don't know. Don't have much to do with it. Yeah. Cool. So we've covered everything, but is there anything that you've always wanted to say about Tom Ned or have feelings about, or things we didn't cover?\n\nNo, I other than to say I encourage anyone that's at a loose end after having retired or finding their life has changed dramatically. I was 72 when I had my stroke and I, at 72, I had no intention. Retirement was a word I never used. I would've kept. Making [00:12:00] pots and running a pottery business for as long as I could do it.\n\n'cause it was quite, it wasn't overly lucrative, but it was productive enough to give me an income. And in a place like Darwin, there's only, it was probably only three or four regular people living from pottery. And I had a part-time job at the uni teaching it was all roses. But once you have a stroke and you can't use one hand.\n\nYou just can't do pottery. But for people thinking about what am I gonna do in retirement coming along and volunteering, being involved in an organization like Tom Net you can't go wrong. There's a lot of things you can do. You can donate blood, you can go to the men's shed and make wooden toys for people and that sort of thing, but I don't think you get quite the same.\n\nIntimate connection between men in a group as you do here. And that's probably the most important part of it for me. Really good way to [00:13:00] explain it. Yeah. I don't live or die on the fact that I go to Tom on Tuesdays, but it is important in my life and after my mental break problem with my ex-wife having something that was routine.\n\nNon pressurizing type of thing to do afterwards was great. Yeah.\n\n",

Sure. Just your full name and spell it first. Actually with this, sorry. Do you mind if I give it a bit of a j Sure. Oh yeah. It's a wild thing. So you can go like that.\n\nOh, there you go. Oh, easy, sweet. All right. Cole, just your full name and spell it first. Georgie Ebit, G-E-O-R-G-I-E-I-B-B-O-T-T. Rad. Let's talk bit about yourself first. So I'm a Tasmanian born and bred. Worked and studied here my whole life, and think Tazzie is an awesome place to raise my family and to live and grow old.\n\nSo good. It's wicked weather at the moment. Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it? Yeah. Rolling. How'd you feel about Orange Sky the first time? I was looking for a volunteering opportunity a few years ago, and I just did some Google searching [00:01:00] and orange sky came up and it was really easy to volunteer.\n\nSo I just jumped online and answered a few questions and then did the online induction and. Training modules and signed on. So it was just very straightforward. Whereas some of the other volunteering opportunities that I looked at were a bit tricky and seemed a bit complicated. Yeah. Tell us a bit about this shift and how, so we've been coming here to the Atch Hospital for maybe a year, maybe 18 months.\n\nAnd so we do laundry for the patients who are here, who are often staying here for a long time getting rehabilitated from different injuries and diseases and stuff. And the laundry that we do for them is for the people that don't have access to friends and family to do their own laundry. So most patients here would have people coming and going and checking on them and doing their laundry, but yeah, we wash for those that [00:02:00] don't.\n\nWhat's do you have much engagement with them? So they hang with them, or is it just no, unfortunately we don't, A lot of them aren't that mobile they don't come down and hang out with us, unfortunately. Sometimes we do or we see them if they're going for a walk with a occupational therapist or a physio or something and they'll come and say hi and thank you.\n\nBut no, we don't hang out like we would another shift. What what impact do you think it has on them in terms of. I think it's huge because otherwise they have to, would have to pay a pretty hefty price to get it done through the hospital and it's not very efficient. And a lot of people that come here are on low incomes and pensions, so yeah, having to pay top dollar to have your washing done would be a big yeah, take a big chunk outta their budget.\n\nIt's something I. Never even thought about that. If you're in hospital having your laundry done. It almost seems a bit weird. Which [00:03:00] is, yeah. Is, and what part of Orange sky do you think is one sort of element of it, of all the other elements around washing, showers, community and stuff, which ones resonate with you the most and why do you keep turning up, I also volunteer at a shift in North Hobart on a Wednesday. And my reason for volunteering is actually the connection with the friends that come along. I get a lot out of hearing their story and just being there to listen to them and, chat to them while they're having their laundry done.\n\nSo that's, I suppose the reason I do it. Coming here, obviously we don't get that interaction, but the staff that we interact with are really grateful. And whenever someone new walks by, curious people ask about it, and it's just really nice to be able to explain the orange sky story and what we do and how the shifts are different and at different locations.\n\nSo yeah, pretty cool. ICO skipped over 10 years of service. What's I always, I'm trying [00:04:00] to ask people this over the next 10 years, what do you think is important for onco to consider? Is it growing, is it staying the same? Is it like doing new things? What for you do you think would be most important?\n\nI think just focusing on what we do and what we do well. And that is just the base. Service for people in need, so doing the laundry and the support and the chat. With the friends that come along I think really important is valuing volunteers and making sure that all volunteers are welcome and it's really easy to volunteer here in Hobart.\n\nWe have issues with getting volunteers and getting people to hang around. So I think that needs to be our priority to make sure that we have enough volunteers because without. People like me, we can't do run shifts and we periodically have to cancel shifts and because of lack of volunteers. So it's really important.\n\nSuch, yeah, such an important part of it. [00:05:00] Cool. Is there anything you've always wanted to say about R Sky allowed the chance to, that you always want to, or to anyone interested in volunteering? Yeah. Get on board it's so much more fulfilling and more rewarding than I ever imagined. So I, yeah.\n\nJump in. See more volunteers. Yeah. Wouldn't that be good? Yeah. Yeah. All right. That's it.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I've been doing this for six years. I just love it, travelling around, talking to people. Yeah, yeah. It's such a cool vibe. Cool man, tell us your name and spell it's good too, just in case. Yeah, so my name's Tom Bowyer. B-O-W-Y-E-R. Tom's spelled the normal way. Clicked in and that's probably why it's wigging out on me. Cool man, I'm just going to go around here a little bit so you're looking at me a little bit more. Yep. Um, so bad at like making this perfect. I swear I'm way more professional than this. Oh no, it's fine. It's perfectly, you know, I'm big on behind the scenes. Oh sick. So that sort of stuff. Behind the scenes is my favourite thing. Oh yeah. Right, so. Can our brother tell me your name, sorry, and spell it? My name's Tom Bowyer. It's spelled B-O-W-Y-E-R. Tom's spelled the usual way. Cool man, tell us where we are and what we're doing here. So we are at Christchurch Cathedral and we are doing community lunch. So yeah, so this is a program that was started around 40 years ago. And it's to help people who are doing it rough in the community get a decent meal. So we run it once a fortnight. It's in conjunction with the cathedral, which is across the road. And we have also help from normally the grammar school, Newcastle Grammar School, but also sometimes this week, the Newcastle Wanderers Rugby Club. Cool man. Why do you do it? The honest answer is my mum told me. So my mum is the Dean of the cathedral and during COVID she, when everything was shut down and when radiuses were happening, she said, you need to go over there and do it. And I did. And I just fell in love with it. I fell in love with being able to give back to the community. Giving back to the community has been one of the big things in my life. I've been always volunteering, always trying to help people. And this just sort of started in Iceland. That's cool man. What's the community like here in terms of like, what's it feel, can you explain what it feels like when everyone's here, I guess, and engaging and that kind of stuff? Yeah, it just feels so great. It's seeing people come back and, you know, sit down and have a nice meal and they're talking with each other. They're sharing their stories. You know, sometimes they'll talk to us and there's one guy who every week when we're closing up shop, he'll come over and have a natter about the nights to me, which is great. And yeah, and also for the volunteers as well, because a lot of the time we've got kids from the school coming. And so it's great to see the kids sort of both get a chance to, to interact outside of school and do some good work and realise that this is what, you know, volunteering actually looks like. And yeah. That's real cool. Orange Sky's out there, what do you reckon about them? Oh, they're great. Great bunch of folks and also doing really important work. You know, people have to have clean clothes since Orange Sky have started coming here. It's just, it's been like a missing piece. You know, something that we really, because we really want to do more. And being able to say we can give you food, we can give you clean clothes, we can give you a chance to sit down and talk with the people at Orange Sky. And that's just been great. Cool. What's this theme of connection conversation, laundry, food, and then there's this whole other space of like mental health housing. What's, is there a connection point there? Is there like different reasons for like, for different types of services? Like, what do you think the, like does there need to be a connection between those things? Or can they be separate in terms of life, I guess? I don't really know. It's above my pay grade really. I'm just a normal volunteer. I guess what do you feel is important about the things here, like washing, laundry, conversation, connection? Like why do you think that's important for these fellows? Yeah, I think it's all about providing a sense of community, providing a sense of safety as well. So we get people bringing their, some guests will bring their kids here. And on one level, it's a bit heartbreaking because you don't want to see kids grow up with that sort of hardship. But another level, I sort of feel sort of a bit warm about it and go, we are that safe place. We are the place where they can bring their kids and they can go, our kid can have a nice meal here and a nice chance to, you know, interact with people. Let's go there. Why do you keep coming back, I guess? Like what keeps you coming back here and doing stuff? Like do you get old sometimes? You're like, oh, I shouldn't have to do this. Or is it like something you look forward to? It is something I look forward to, yeah. It's, there's something else I say to the kids. So sometimes if we've got a little bit of space, I'll give them a talk about why I do it. And I always say I do it because my mum tells me to. It gives me a great sense of security. It gives me a sense of smugness when I'm talking to my friends and going, oh, I can't catch up with you this weekend. I'm doing community volunteering. And the third reason is if people like us don't do it, then no one else will. We are, there are other places in Newcastle, but there aren't enough. And we need to be there to be able to say we can provide food, we can provide laundry, we can provide shelter. We can do this. And I say to the kids as well, it's not like if you're working at a cafe or whatever and you call in sick and go, oh, sorry mate, you know, can't come in today. And you know, you can organise someone to fill in for your shift. We have however many kids we have. We've done it with two kids. We've done it with 20 kids. What do you reckon the kids get out of it? Like from a life skill perspective, why do you reckon it's an important or a good thing for them to be able to engage with as a school student? I think being, having that sense of volunteering, community volunteering instilled in you when you're young age. I'm a bit biased because I had it. And so I remember when I was in high school, I'd come home from school every Monday and my mum and I would do a run of Aldi and just pick up huge bulk packages of food and cordial and stuff and then take it home and make it all up into little hampers and then drive it out to families doing it rough in the community. And I think that sense of social justice, that sense of going, we need to do this. We need to give back to the community. You see a lot of people these days, kids and adults who just don't realise that and think, you know, try not to look at this sort of stuff and go, you know, think it's really nice, but they don't want to do it. And I go, you've got to do it. You've got to try. It's so good to have like an excuse to create a show. It's so good to have an excuse to create a different type of connection with people that you might not stop and talk to. And yeah, I wonder what that does for the broader societal stuff too, right? A lot of kids get that experience from their school rather than just learning to be awesome themselves. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what's the school's connection, I guess? Does it actively support kids to do this? Does it kind of sit in the background or what's the school's vibe? Yeah, so the school's really supportive about it. So most weeks in school term we'll have at least one teacher, generally two teachers come. They will really bang the drum and tell the kids, you've got to do this. There are some kids who will come in every week of the term. There are some kids who will only come in when it's their turn to come in. There are some kids who will come in during the holidays. And yeah, and it is that sense of they realise how good it feels to give back. Give back to the community and yeah. And the schools, like I say, really support it. And it's the same with the rugby club as well. So the rugby club, it's a bit different because they only do it once every three months, but there's some who come every time the rugby club is in. They'll come and they'll come back and go, this was so good, I want to do it again. Sarad. Well done, well spoken.\n",

      "Transcript": "Nic - Orange Sky\n===\n\n[00:00:00] Orange sky is Australia's first ever mobile laundry for people experiencing hardship and homelessness.\n\nWe started in October, 2014 in Brisbane with this idea of putting two washing machines and two dryers in a van and driving around and washing and drying clothes for free. And now Orange Sky has services all around Australia and New Zealand. Our mission is to positively connect communities and how we do that.\n\nThrough that thing we started with, which is washing, but also now showers, volunteers in remote communities, but most importantly providing really basic human rights to people in the community.\n\nWhen we started Orange Sky 10 years ago, we had this really simple idea, which was to bring laundry to people who needed it, and never, we could never have imagined the impact that Orange Sky would have on the world. The simplicity of what we do. But the realization that there's people all around the world that don't have access to this really basic human right.\n\nOver the last 10 years, we've seen people from all around the [00:01:00] world reach out and say. That they are interested in orange sky or they're inspired by orange sky or that they need an orange sky in their community. And here in Athens is one of those examples with Ithaca Laundry reaching out and launching their own laundry vans.\n\nTo bring organizations like the washing machine project, like Drop in the Ocean, Ithaca Laundry together is I think, how complex issues like homelessness or the lack of access to hygiene. Services, like washing machines can be sold through, not through one organization, through collaborative partnerships. \n\nThere's a lot of unknowns about the future, and we don't know how big something like this would grow. We never thought that orange sky would be where it is today. But I think also what we know is that if we stay grounded in our belief is where the biggest impact can happen.\n\nThat's why, this alliance isn't owned or operated by anyone. It's a group of like-minded organizations coming together and saying. We want to, we know that, one plus one is greater than two. [00:02:00] And the opportunity to be better will only help our organizations deliver more impact where it's needed.\n\nBehind every load of washing is a human. And that's the heart of what all of these organizations have in common, is people that are fleeing violence, people that don't have a safe place to call home.\n\nPeople that still manually hand wash their clothes, people that don't have a safe place to sleep. And I think that. Is behind every load of washing people. But also behind every organization is people. And I think, regardless of where you are, the opportunity to build a center of excellence and mastery is really important. \n\nThis is the first time that four organizations operating in the laundry space have come together. We have Ithaca Laundry that run a mobile laundry here in Athens in Greece. We have drop in the ocean that run laundry services and refugee camps here in Europe. We have the washing machine project that build a fully manual flat packable washing machine for 60% of the worlds [00:03:00] who still manually hand wash clothes.\n\nAnd we have Orange sky who build mobile laundromats in Australia and New Zealand. And for the first time, all of these organizations have come together through the common thing of laundry and helping people to look at how we can collaborate as an alliance. \n\n",

      "Transcript": "Benjamin Moss: [00:00:00] Alright, that's pretty good. And then just look at me.\nWhat bros? Just send me your full name and spell it for me. Yep. Uh, Benjamin Moss. B N J A M I N M O S. Cool. Um, tell me a little bit about your role over on Stratty. So I'm a, uh, senior lecturer with the University of Queensland. I'm based at the Moreton Bay Research Station. Uh, where I do teaching and research.\nMainly in the marine sciences. Tell me a little bit about, um, the last few years, I guess, and the type of work and how it feels to be on the island. Yeah, so I joined UQ about two years ago now. Um, based here on the island. The first full time academic to be based here at the Moreton Bay Research Station.\nUm, yeah, since I've arrived, I've, um, met up with the community, met with Elders and Um, heard from them about what their, um, main concerns are about [00:01:00] in the marine environment and looking to help, um, help solve some of those issues, particularly around oyster reef restoration, about bringing oyster reefs back, creating new habitats for animals and places, um, where we can go and get oysters, get food, uh, get fish and be out there in the natural environment.\nUm, why do you think it's important for, um, the, um, the focus to come from the Elders and not just from research, I think? So it's really important that the way that we do our research\nIt's really important that the way that we do our research and the way that we engage with community is really led by community and by Elders. Um There's been lots of examples in the past where science has really lost its way because it hasn't been connected with community and scientists [00:02:00] have gone and done things that are not ethical and not in line with what the community expects.\nSo it's really important that we as scientists engage with Elders and listen and understand what the concerns of the community are, what is most important for community and what is Our role as scientists is then to help, um, create the solutions that community is looking for. To help solve those problems, to help create, uh, new jobs, new industries, whatever it is that community needs.\nThat's our role. We're here to serve the community. Awesome. Um, there's been recent, um, some recent support around things like justice on the island and, um, there seems to be a lot of, like opportunity to be able to, um, lead their own programs and stuff. Um, how does that trickle over, I guess, to all areas from science to wellbeing to other things?\nYeah, I've been really inspired by [00:03:00] what Elders are doing with their justice reinvestment, um, initiatives. Um, it's really good to see that it's just a holistic view of how, um, the community comes together to support everybody. And my role as part of that is, is in through research and teaching and outreach with the community, um, to support that just a little bit in that whole picture, um, based around the marine environment and that just being a small part of the whole.\nAnd how important is it for, um, people like Sean, I guess, to, um, be part of the restoration of an industry like oysters and, um, What part does that play in the community, if that's, if they can be successful in, um, sort of like, solving, um, some of the issues with the oysters, or like, um, how does that trickle into the economy of the island and that type of stuff?\nYeah, it's really important that we get everybody working together, so it's not [00:04:00] just the university and the community, but there's also, uh, industry partners and our First Nations businesses are really important as well. So when we all work together, then we can have a better chance of solving those big issues.\nSo, um, for instance, things like employment, um, that just can't necessarily come from one group. So where we can work together with industry, with our first nations business partners, then we can create those opportunities for employment. Um, if we try and just do that each in our own little groups, we're not going to do as well as if we all work together.\nTell us about today. What did we do today? So today we had our Deadly Marine Science Program here at the Moreton Bay Research Station as part of, uh, Elders, uh, School Holiday Program and we run this, uh, every year. Our marine, Deadly Marine Science Days, usually once every holidays. Today, we had the kids [00:05:00] doing three different activities.\nThe first one was looking at the different layers of the ocean, and they created a little model ocean in containers with different layers of materials. That was pretty fun. Our second activity, we had a little bit of chemistry, looking at a bit of chromatography, a bit of how colors separate. and looking at, um, how different types of metals when you heat them up, how they give off different colors of light.\nAnd then finally we looked at some of the animals that make their homes in some of the shellfish reefs that we're restoring here in Moreton Bay. So some really cool and different science and some really fun activities. And if we've got the kids having fun, uh, sometimes we can sneak a little bit of learning in there as well.\nSo yeah, it was a really great day and really great to see. And what's the importance of, um, education and knowledge, um, coming up through the generations and from young kids, um, at this stage? Look, this is really hugely important. We know, [00:06:00] um, how important education is for, um, for outcomes in our lives, for, um, whether you want to go and get a job, whether you want to start up your own business, whatever it is that you want to do in life, having a really good foundation of education is really key for that.\nUm, if you don't know about something, then you might be running into a situation where you run into some harm or. Um, You don't know how to get out of it. So that's why education is super important. And so that's part of what we do as part of these, um, Deadly Marine Science Days, is we're just getting the kids having fun.\nAnd through that, then we can sneak in some learning about some different things as well. And what's the impact of having Elders and young people in that same space together learning and, and, uh, having that process? It's hugely important to have both our Elders and our young people in the same room together learning from each other.\nOur Elders are such a wealth of knowledge. Um, [00:07:00] they've been here for so long and, and gaining all the knowledge and, and experience. And, um, I myself, I'm still relatively young. I'm looking to my Elders to gain that knowledge, to gain that understanding about where I am, what's going on, including here in the marine environment as well.\nSo, um, Our Elders are a really key source of knowledge. And so we shouldn't just think that the science on its own is a really good source of knowledge and it's a really good way to understand the world. But it's also important to have our Elders as another source of knowledge and another way of understanding the world and bringing all that together.\nAnd what's next for the research station and UQ's partnership here? What do you think is going to happen over the next year or five years? Um, so. We've got multiple projects going on at the moment, um, with Elders and with the community. So we're working together with our First Nations Oyster Farmers to understand, um, better ways of [00:08:00] growing oysters, um, help those businesses grow and become more profitable.\nWe're working with, um, with Elders looking at oyster reef restoration to bring back oyster reefs in the bay. We've lost more than 95 percent of the oyster reefs that used to be here in Moreton Bay. Um, and so we're doing everything that we can to try and bring those back because they're such key habitats for oysters, um, which are really important food source.\nUm, but they're also habitat for lots of other types of animals as well. So we need to bring those back as well as looking after our other habitats as well. Other things like our sea grasses, our coral reefs. Our sand flats, our mud flats, all of these, our mangroves, all of these habitats that are really, really important in keeping our marine environments healthy, which means it keeps us healthy as well.\nSo cool. Um, last question is like, how do you, how do you go from, um, doing this locally [00:09:00] to then sharing it on a, um, national or a global level of like that Indigenous knowledge across Australia and across the world? Because people are part of it. Yeah. So, um, so when we're thinking about Indigenous knowledge, we, we do this at a small scale, like we're doing here on in Morton Bay on Stradbroke Island, understanding, um, the local conditions and how our local knowledges help us to inform, to look after the environment, to care for country.\nAnd then as we learn more and more about that, then through the use of science. And we can share that knowledge with, um, the broader world. And a great example of that is, is the knowledges that have come out around, um, fire and understanding, um, burning and looking after country. So we've had those really big bushfires in the past couple of decades, um, And now we're looking more and more to understand those [00:10:00] traditional practices of burning country and looking after country and making sure that we don't have those really big fires that just go through and burn everything and destroy and kill all the animals.\nSo if we can avoid that by understanding the many thousands of years, tens of thousands of years of, um, knowledge that has been built up in this country by First Nations peoples. Um, and. Um, then we can look after country better. Amazing. Um, anything else I think I've missed or anything you want to say? No.\nNo. I think that's it. Thanks, Ledge.\n",

Cool. That's wicked. So we put that happening, and I just sent a bit of stuff about Napa Homestead, where we are, and a bit of history of the campground and stuff as well. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah, so just a bit of stuff there. Cool. I sent the good news stories with a few images on there, but I'll also share our photos as well. Awesome. Yeah. One quick one on the walking trail. It's super exciting. We're going back up to Palm Island next week. We're working with the Minga Minga Rangers, and they're actually working on a walking track as well as part of what they're doing. So they're looking at building a boardwalk that goes through their wetlands. But I was just thinking, like, I'd love to just be able to share what their process looks and feels like just as, like, a case study and love to, like, yeah, hear about yours as well just as, like, a and love to like yeah hear about yours as well just as like a bit of knowledge sharing stuff yeah i sent that um document with the anti-government together which is pretty good so have a look at that awesome yeah even if you want to share that with the team with your yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's. I'm pretty excited that they're going. They just bought an underwater drone, and they're going to be filming a, yeah, they're going to be filming this. They've got a Manta Ray dreaming story, and there's these things called the Three Sisters, which is a cliff face under the water. So they're going to film that and then do a story about that so that they can have that on their website as like an interactive type thing, which is pretty rad. Wow, that's really cool. Yeah. Super cool. AI stuff. Yeah, yeah. What's the rangers like at Alice there? Do you have indigenous rangers there? Yes. Yeah, so it's the, yeah, the Yipa-Rinya Cheddar, which is dreaming. And it's the caterpillar dreaming here for us, the rangers. Awesome. That's what they represent. And so the Yipa-Rinya, you know, the Yipa-Rinya in, you know, the Yipa-Irinya in the Arindra language, the Yipa is the tar vine that the caterpillar eats. Cool. And then the Irinya means belonging to place and country. Amazing. And so, yeah, so you've got, you know, the caterpillars travelling all through Mbantua and travelling along for ceremony. You've got caterpillars coming from the west, which is the Njalpana caterpillar, which is all the Western Ireland mob. And then you've got the east caterpillar, which is the Nidigit caterpillar on the left side of the ranges. So amazing. That's so cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Well, yeah, I'm happy to roll with this hour, however you think useful. And then, like, also I've got some, like, specific stuff, which is, like, at the moment, I think there's about six or seven different pages which we'll build out. So at the moment it's something like home page about program services, some, not sure what it is yet, but something that relates to like cultural activities. Resources is like a, maybe we can do that later, like not a big one. Contact form obviously, and then just like some kind of like blog situation that you definitely don't have to nail straight away but it's good to have for the for the meantime um so like and i think as i said before i think we should probably try and just go super light initially for like a something that we can launch and then um we can just create the schedule um because yeah it's super interesting i'm uh doing this across a few different places at the moment and um super pumped because we get to go and spend a bunch of days in straddy just um with the kids program over there doing some story stuff um and i think there's there's there's a bunch of different like ways in which we're telling stories across community that i think hopefully can match up a little bit in terms of like if we can get a template that's almost like um how to like write a short story and then some photos and stuff. Um, I think there's some really cool sharing stuff we can do around like how we're all telling stories and then, um, yeah, and figure out how that is almost like this shared, like knowledge base of, of how to do this stuff. Um, and then, um, yeah. And like maybe, um, like, yeah, I think it's awesome if you keep sending me stuff and then if you're open to it, maybe I can do some more pointed questions over the hour to see if I can get out of you exactly, like, the stuff that you might not have, if that's okay. Yeah. No, it sounds good. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, even when we travel we like to know a little bit about the country. Yeah. And it's always really interesting for us and we always, you know, they always, oh, what are you doing? And, you know, thank you for showing us around and teaching us the landscape and what that means for us as, you know, traditional owners as well. So, no, definitely, you know, that and that homepage looks like will be our selling point, I think. Awesome. And one last thing before we kick off is like super pumped that Brodie from Mount Isa, who I've been working with on his fitness program, he got his grant from Sport and Rec, which means that he can do three camps around Adele's Grove sort of area, Dumadji sort of area, which is rad so i'd love to extend um that opportunity to your young people as well over next year if there's an opportunity where you would like some young people to come on that that it's going to be the three school holidays um and also pumped because he's been part of this amp fellowship thing um and i was with him in mount is Isaac running, helping him with his speech and pitch and stuff and he was super worried about it and then he ended up winning, which is pretty awesome. So we were, yeah, we were super pumped that he beat us, which was pretty funny. Like I'm trying to mentor him and he's beating me at stuff, which is a good sign. But, yeah, it'll be awesome to be able to um yeah to share that opportunity with young people around australia where possible yeah for sure cool cool so um i think it'd be awesome and you're okay for me to record this i guess if that's yeah Yeah. Cool. Sorry. I'd love just to go through a couple of things where it's like, what's like, I guess, I don't know if you have a bio each that you've written previously, but maybe... Yeah, we do. Cool. I could quickly send that through an email now as well amazing maybe and maybe like it's always good like if you're comfortable and it's not too weird whether you want to just like um share briefly how that bio feels to yourselves um as a little kickoff thing and then yeah and then we can sort of launch into the other bits. Yeah. Do you want me to start? I mean, I guess for me, you know, coming from two big families and pioneering families from Central Australia, you know, the Bloomfield side, which is, you know, my father's side, which is Eastern Arendelle. And he's grew up out at the Loves Creek on the station all his life. And you'll see a bit of information and you'll see his old dad and stuff in that stuff I sent through. And, you know, working from a young age, pretty much, you know, 10 years old, working from a young age, pretty much, you know, 10 years old, helping, you know, our grandfather and grandmother and granny and that, you know, get work for the, you know, white station owners and live in a shack up on the hill to next to the big house so that, you know, granny and, you know, our grandparents can, you know, be, you know, working for the white man out there. And, you know, that history is still, you know, really rich in us. You know, Dad, pretty much we're out there as often as we can. And, you know, the house, you know, was bulldozed down, but it's still there and that history is there for us. but it's still there and that history is there for us. You know, Dad comes from a really big family that way, an Aboriginal network kinship family. And so we're connected right through from, you know, Hearts Range all the way back to Santa Teresa and on his side. And I guess, you know, from that hard, you know, Stockman lifestyle, station hand and all of that, we learned from a really young age that, you know, hard labour is what they, you know, endured growing up. And I think for us, you know, we were, you know, fortunate enough to grow up on the station and be a part of, you know, mustering and getting up early, settling the horses, going out with, you know, our uncles and our father, mustering cattle, building the stockyards for the cattle, you know, in the helicopters riding bikes and learnt how to drive a car at a young age and bull catchers and all of that it was really a fun loving upbringing from that side of growing up so yeah, like Dad's the oldest, and then his father was the oldest of many other siblings, and we have a really big family connection out that way. Then, you know, the Bloomfield side is obviously our Wh white side family name. So our grandfather was the father, the son of the white station owner, one of his sons, which is Harry Bloomfield. And so that's where Dad gets his name from. But we get our Aboriginal land rights entitlements from, you know, Grandpa Max also, the Bloomfield side, because his mother was a Johnson. And so Granny was a Johnson and she's got all connections. But my father's mum was a Wiltshire. And no relation to the murdering first Wiltshire here in Central Australia, their first ever policeman that got charged with murder of an Aboriginal man. But, yes, same name. And apparently it was Nana Edna's brother's kid somehow, that side. So, yeah. But, yeah, so Nana now we get our land rights through with the Wiltshire side out of Love's Creek and you know something that we're very proud of and also have a lot of um knowledge around you know our family tree we've got all of that our kinships and we've got a lot of history in terms of, you know, the white men's records of history through Australia and stuff, which is pretty unique for a lot of Central Australian... I'm a big fan of her father was a little and he was a he was a sibling of three he had four siblings an older sister sorry and and two brothers so three siblings however the old Scotsman where we get our little name from he then went to down at the Tempe Downs area and married out there as well and had a lot of siblings a lot of maybe three three or four children down there as well, which we're all aware of and we know our family tree on the Liddell site as well. You know, our grandfather Milton was the first Aboriginal man to own a taxi service in Alice Springs. He had his own wood yard, which provided wood for many Central Australian families here. He also was part of the, you know, the Central Land Council, the build-up on that, and he's recorded in many recordings, video recordings around Central Australia, and being, you know, a leader in that aspect. And also started up the Aboriginal Legal Service, which my auntie held a position for 30 years as the CEO there. And that's where I began my working career, I guess, in the legal service as a trainee straight out of high school, 17 years old. And then I worked there for, I think I worked there for six years. Then I moved over to Far North Queensland and worked over in Cairns, travelled all over there with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service. So as far as Bamaga, we went to court and then back down to Innisfail, as far as Innisfail and then all the table lands and Mareeba and Atherton and all of that as well. I lived over there for three years um then they were going through their tender process and stuff and i thought well i want to go back home because there's so much i need to help mom and dad with you know in terms of love's creek and then embattler itself as well um i came back home um and then I worked for another three years or two years here in the family section, mainly doing criminal stuff in Queensland, and then came back and worked in the family section. Then I got my long service because they were able to put it all together so the long service leave um did a trip overseas with took my father um you know dad you know managed to send all his six kids traveling everywhere and one pay packet and um we've managed to travel you know the country playing basketball for the northern territory um site so that was pretty cool, us four sisters. Yeah, one of six. I'm a twin. My oldest brother lives in Adelaide. Other brother, two older brothers, he lives here. An older sister, myself, my twin, and a younger sister. myself, my twin and a younger sister. An auntie of, oh my god, nine nieces and six nephews. I bought a house. I've travelled. Yeah, I did the Convention of the Rights of the Child in Geneva. I went and did that and it was really good experience because you know um during that era of the intervention it was really tough because you know a lot of our Aboriginal men were looked upon as you know rapists and all of that and it was really horrible and and a lot of our kids were being removed for unnecessary reasons in terms of neglect whether that was you know just because they're running around you know a bit dirty and you know having dinner late or having brekkie late or whatever. However you know it was really a struggle for educating our mob that they needed to come in for visitation rights and keep that up to date and you know um and a lot of our mob would come into town and and not have the opportunity to see kids so that was really you know challenging time because you know they're in they made it all the way from um from community to be in town and then at the end of the day they weren't able to see their kids because they had their routine and stuff so you know trying to explain that to mob when they came into town for that was you know really sad because they have to you know jump through hoops to be able to see their kids when their kids were removed for minor you know minor issues and concerns. I think being able to be a part of the Royal Commission in the detention and child protection space in Darwin and give my experience in terms of.....give my evidence in terms of my experience here in Central Australia, what we were navigating and really challenging here for our mob here. It was good because that then, you know, like I said, led to, you know, being able to present in Geneva and being able to have an Aboriginal voice but an Aboriginal perspective as well and giving honest feedback and reality um so that was really i thought that was really great being a part of that um presented at the um snake conference which is the national yeah children's um body um and we you know presented there around the reality of Central Australia and just kind of around our perspectives as traditional owners and as Aboriginal people here as well. So I think which led to you know us being able to be in a position that we've done so much around being able to be in a position that we've done so much around um you know having um a wealth of knowledge and experience um that we were able to then kind of put that together and lean on that leading forward and setting up our business um being able to share our knowledge and culture, you know, with many different people from all walks of life and backgrounds has been really unique because they can hear the passion and also, you know, the strength in our voices, but also just around, you know, the reality. Stop being dumb. Like, this is our history. So yeah, we kind of led on to advocating for ourselves around being traditional owners and having that respect and also having that history and knowledge behind us to be able to share all of that. I think working in the legal space for over 20 years has given us, you know, our backbone in navigating many things for Tanya and I. We've always kind of winged everything, you know, Tanya comes from that family background, but, you know, her and I at the moment are challenging, you know central land council and many things and one thing we've known is to definitely put everything in writing and you know put it back on them and ask them questions and stuff like that so that we have it in writing so i think have coming from that legal background we've been able to you know push our way through and kind of winging everything that we're doing at the moment. And I also think, you know, coming from a big background, you know, with my siblings who have many friends, my family, we have many connections. We're able to tap into good people who are willing to support us and willing to help us on our journey and help us continue the progress that we've been able to start just from, you know, Tanira and I and Kirsty and mum pushing us and dad pushing us as well, you know, with dad's comments, you know, you're only going to get a yes or no, so you might as well do it. So we've been able to, know lean on them quite um quite often just around debriefing on where to now and what do you think about this and you know throwing out different perspectives which has helped us quite a bit um for our strength as well um and i think also you know having you know connections in terms of us our brother-in-law used to play for sydney swan st kilda and him now linking in with them wanting to come out and do a cultural um immersion trip type um um event with us um which tanya and i will work on next year i i know that they just did a a trip out at um maramunga country um tenant creek the collingwood footy team so similar to that um fred's keen to you know link us up and get that happening with the sydney swans and stuff so we want to be able to yeah kind of just give them an idea of the challenges that we've faced you know Tanya reminds us quite often that you know we need to think about when we weren't colonized until a hundred years later from the east coast and we're still playing catch up and we're still having to navigate this white system that everyone else has a head start on. So we're still kind of supporting our mob because a lot of our mob, yes, they are coming into town and being a part of town, but they still don't have the concept of the understanding of how to live in two worlds as as we've grown up and as we've been able to do all our life um so it's really yeah trying to continue to empower more but i think it does get a bit challenging when we do have so many language groups and so many cross-border community members coming into our small little town hub you know we need to really think about you know making everybody accountable and kind of getting you know the respect back for our own people. And we also want to be able to share the workload because we're drowning at the moment as, you know, central our own people, but also as central Australians that, you know, have worked hard to get us where we are today. So, yeah. I don't know if that was what you wanted, but... Oh, you can keep going if you want it's awesome it's um um so good and like i think the the context stuff is so hard to do on a website but if we can almost um have more context the better i think and that's something I'm trying to learn especially what I mean community is like how do you make sure that you are spending enough time getting all of the context and then working out how you can sort of distill that with the person that you're engaging with and yeah the one like and then and then I've got a few few questions if that's okay um so i want to get the motto sort of thing right and um i think you've been talking about this idea of two cultures one world um working together what's a what's the what what is that is that something that you say often and then come back to as a as a principle um and b how do you usually say that and then c i guess how would you describe that as a as like a principle we do use that a lot yeah because of the two worlds so like christie said because of that you know because we like we said we're colonized 100 years after the east coast we're 100 years behind everyone else so our young people are literally trying to live in these two different worlds so you know we're lucky because we've got language we've got ceremony we've got those cultural aspects which unfortunately the east coast lost a lot of that but then they're also trying to navigate this white world of going to school you know earning money doing all those type of things and what that looks like but we often talk about um helping these young people to be strong in both those worlds because at the moment for a young person in central australia you basically have to choose you really have to just choose whether you're going to be strong in culture and your aboriginality or if you're going to be strong in the Western world. Because, as you probably know with your work then, you know, growing up in community, schooling's not great. Most schools don't go... I think there's only one or two schools in Central Australia that go past Year 6. So to even get beyond a primary school education, we already are asking, you know, 11 and 12-year-olds to decide, are you going to be living out bush with your family or do you need to go to boarding school and be strong in the Western world? So from our perspective, for our young people, this is where they're failing the most, is that there's no strength in both those worlds it's really like a one-sided option and then for us as people living in town our kids you know because we enforce bullying and all those things our kids get to be strong in the western world but then they miss out a lot of the time on that cultural line. So we're basically creating two different groups of young Aboriginal people, these people that are strong in culture and then these people that are strong in the Western world. But they don't have both of those things, which, as we know, is what they need to survive going forward. But for us, it's probably the most significant they need to survive going forward but for us it's probably the most significant issue for young people going forward and it's the thing that we have to figure out how to tackle because we don't people well we don't see us being able to break this cycle without creating the way of young people being able to be strong in both those areas and even for adults you know if you look throughout australia even and aboriginal people there are very very few aboriginal people that you could name as being strong in both their culture and strong in the western world um you know even if you look at traditions and things like that a lot of the time they've had to make a choice or sacrifice in one of those spaces and our kids aren't doing it well I think if you add on the other compounding factors obviously of growing up in disadvantage alcoholism you know social media you know watching American gangster stuff and all that. If you add those factors to this, our kids are really failing in this space. They can't, you know, the kids that we work with, I mean, I wouldn't say that they're particularly strong in either space. Even in identity as Aboriginal people, they're not that strong in that, you know. A lot of the time, we're telling them who they are and where they're from. Yeah. Because even the language group, you know, what areas are around and stuff, you know, they'll ask someone, what's, you know, which name I've called again? They're a Mujida mob. That's the Mujida group what's you know which name i've called again they're a majidah mob that's the majidah group there you know so simple little things like that that a lot of our mobs should know um and you know look at it also yeah look a lot of the tomes our young fellas are taking through ceremony too early and they don't have a sense of understanding around, you know, what it is to be a young man and what responsibilities and stuff because a lot of our, you know, other ones that are, you know, leading that are not quite academic in terms of that knowledge sharing of women you know work history work and stuff like that so it's yeah really falls back on us to navigate that we can't as Aboriginal women because that's culturally inappropriate and then therefore we need to see you know frederick who's our brother-in-law and he needs to navigate that as an aboriginal man who's been through ceremony and there's a lot of you know factors that we take in and also you know it does put a big risk put our lives at risk you know because we are navigating this and well what are them going to know what are they talking about for and and if we didn't have this strong background of our parents of our families we wouldn't be in the position what we are um and and you know you know our father in anything hopefully that we do um and he's always kind of led us to you know you mother the one i've got to talk about you have to go to meetings you have to talk up for our family for our country now and then you've got then you've got other men there that say, well, them women shouldn't be talking. And therefore you've got our fathers saying, no, no, shut up, they're not talking for you, they're talking for me and this is my country and they can talk up for this country. So these are the things that, you know, we face quite often. And, you know, we face quite often. And, you know, thanks to our father who's been able to support us and, you know, have our back in everything that we do because we're able to share what we're doing and what our thoughts are around it, then he will be able to support that and navigate that for us as well. And I guess our role in that two-world thing has been, well, what we talk about is sort of bridge that divide. We're basically sort of castles of this sort of middleman between the two worlds, trying to help these young people and their family be strong in both those spaces and do whatever we need to do to link them into whatever they need to be linked into. Access everything that they can to strengthen themselves as young people, you know, that mentoring. So we met the other day and we were sort of saying, what has really become is that real big sister little sister smell the big brother little brother title program where we basically our workers are there for these kids for anything you know often the school will ring up and be like oh can you sit with the kids but they won't engage yeah and they're going to go to the school all day with them wants to help them too. So it's become a lot more than it was first originally meant to be, but that's just because the relationships we've built. I mean, my biggest thing that I worry about, like when we talk about this two worlds thing world's leading or there's half onto these guys you know like our kids their education is zero you know we have 17 18 year olds they i mean they could write their name but beyond that and you know my biggest thing we see coming from that legal background is how are you meant to ever advocate for yourself in any space like in any way living in the world? You know, every day we all advocate for a girl in the summer. You know, like even if you go to the shop and the scanner scans your food wrong, that kind of stuff. Our kids don't even have the ability because their education is so low to do any of that. And that's what worries me the most about how you break this cycle because if we keep having generations become an advocate on a basic level, we're never going to break the cycle that we're in with our young people. Have you ever, like it's such a visual, like explanation, description that you're providing here. Have you ever tried to draw what this means? And if you did or if you didn't, did you ever have any concepts that were interesting in relation to like, are there local symbols and stuff that relate do you think or is there like a way in which you would describe what you would want that to look like would it be some some circular things with some um joining together or like yeah has that been something you've maybe thought about previously we've done like a basic one which is exactly what you just said it's pretty much like two circles. If you send it to you, it's just two circles, and then one at the bottom that overlaps them, which is the bridging. And then each circle is also the Western world. So we've done a very basic sort of explanation one. We'll send it. Christy might have put it already in. If we send you our business sort of profile thing, it's on there. Okay, cool. Yeah, it could definitely be made a lot fancier at some point. Okay, cool. I'd love to give it a crack. One thing whilst you were talking I was thinking is there's this really interesting, I think you said it before, around like having a unique skill set because there's all of this like quite difficult to understand systemic stuff that kids need to know, whether it's legal, health, systemic justice stuff and then there's traditional knowledge in which the system doesn't know, right? Like it's this kind of really stupid situation we've got ourselves in where the system doesn't know the traditional knowledge and like the kids don't know the systemic knowledge. How would you say that you're working to, I guess there's a balance of like supporting the young people to know what's going on, but then there's also like how you're supporting the system to know do you do you have a concept of what you want to do more is there a balance in which you're trying to work towards for the business for that stuff I guess We used to do a lot more of it, but we got quite burnt out from it. Especially when we were at Flinders Uni, we were doing it quite a lot. But we do, you know, whenever we're taught, Yeah Tanya puts it in a really great way for non-Aboriginal people to get a concept of and you know being on the panel for the you know federal court judges when they hosted them 112 judges last year it was really an eye-opener to have Tanya on that panel, but giving a true and reality perspective of all of these different heads of, you know, Congress around alcohol, prosecutions around policing, and I think there was a community housing or something and Tanya's just given them a straight answer around the perspective of the life of an Aboriginal person. You can't have one or the other because there's barriers, there's challenges and all of that within that but we're quite often always giving you you know, government an insight of, you know, this is what they want to hear, this is what they need to hear. In terms of, like, even an example that, you know, our young people, you know, have dropped off and haven't engaged. because one of the young girls has an engagement because she is now, you know, at that age of 16, 17, also supporting mum around the family dynamics or supporting the whole family. So that young girl now is, you know, looking trailer with her mother because she's trying to support her mum in looking after everybody. Rather than mum supporting her going to school, getting an education and pushing her to advocate for herself and get her own little life, mum's kind of grabbed onto her, yes, you come with me and we'll go with this community for sports weekend, and we'll take the kids, and we're going to go this way for a royalty meeting, and we've got to go this way for another meeting, or ceremony. So that's the life of a young Aboriginal girl, yeah even for an aboriginal yellow policy they're in a house in town and then they've got a house in community you know and so a lot quite often our kids are sometimes in town and then they'll go back oh no we can't go to school because we're going to go back down to kent or we can't go to school we're going to go back out to Kintore, we can't go to school, we're going back out to Lint. And so quite often, you know, you're missing a week of school because you're waiting on your parents to make a decision whether you're going back out to community to Lint and to stay for however long, or you're staying in town and missing out on school because you're waiting, playing a waiting game for when the next royalty meeting is or when the next fucking, you know, ceremony or bloody sports weekend. The bush boss. The bush boss is travelling back and forth. So it's really, this is, this is unfortunately, this is how these young people live their day-to-day around you know bloody seeing if they're doing a sports weekend seeing if they're going that way for a funeral seeing if they're going you know back to community to stay because of trouble in town um i'm super interested maybe if you could try this out and you don't have to nail it, but I was wondering if you'd be able to almost walk us through, like from when a young person gets to the property to Leaves, what would their journey be throughout that process, I guess, if you would be able to tell someone what sort of a journey or process a young person might go through during a program yeah so for um we can start with um i guess the youngest we had on board um he's now um he's now 12 anthony yeah he came on board when it was 10 weeks. Wow. So we had, yeah, and so this little young fella, you know, we were able to, he wasn't originally on our list, but we said, well, because he's a younger brother, cousin to one of the other young fellas we had on, we said, all right, we'll grab him and come on, you know. So as soon as he became aware that he was a part of our team, we were able to then bring him along. He started participating in, you know, many activities and coming along up to the office, getting to know everybody, getting to know where we fit in terms of who we are as traditional learners, our family groups and, you know, who we know and who they know out of our family. We were able to then connect and find out that, you know, this little young fella's got many connections with, you know, our staff, Megan and Fred, and being able to link in that way. So for him, we were able to then be a part of his education journey, linking him back into school. We would get reports, Cody, since working with him, you know, this young fella has shown respect to us. This young fella has also been more engaged in that school. And I think, you know, our first feedback from, you know, the operation leader, which is the heads of all different government agencies, they even noticed the change in these little young people's lives, and in particular Anthony as well. And so we were getting, you know, great feedback around the support that we were able to offer these young people. You know, these young people are uptown. We would notice them and call them out and being able to engage with them and not them being cheeky like they are to other services. So that's why that respect for us because we're traditional learners and we know their family, but also we've shown a bit of up and down. He's right. What do you need? Do you want to go and get a feed before I go home? So you can have them uptown later at want to go and get a feed before i go home so you could have them up down at you know late at night and hanging around for a feed so we would quite often call them a feed and then all right do you need a lift home so i can take me home and then they'd quite often say well no that's home i just i don't want to go home yet but the town camps you know a long way out of town um nope he's home why does you know anthony want to go home so we were able to then all right well the youth teams there make sure you jump in the bath to get home so i think we were yeah able to link in with many services to be able to provide that support. Sometimes services, when we first started, services were kind of all, you know, got their stinks up and stuff because we're another service coming on board. But everyone had a job to do, you know, and it was very clear what our role was. But then, you know, many services continue to play dumb and don't know what we were there for. So we continue to support Anthony and still today. He is now, you know, hasn't been seen that much on the night notes. We have since then removed him from Operation Luna, which is high-risk Yale people. And this Yale fella now, you know, we signed him up for basketball. He then joined our basketball club. Missed out a few games because of, you know, peer pressure and stuff like that. But we were able to get him back playing last couple of weeks ago but he still isn't back on operation lunar so he's not an at risk young person he still quite often engages with everybody even when we do speak to him Fred's away at the moment but he quite often participates in programs as well. We'll continue to keep him on our list because he is a young fellow where his mum lives in Adelaide. He lives here with his auntie. He's got all these little cousin brothers that are all in this little cohort of little runamucks at the moment that we're supporting but also putting that responsibility back on the parents as well because your young people are the ones that are causing havoc at the moment and everybody's talking about this particular camp what are you doing to support your own kid or your nephew? So we've been able to support, you know, getting these young people through school, also talking to the school and teaming up with them around the support that they need as well. And these young fellas know that we do receive night notes. They do know if they do muck up, we're going to know. And it's around that, you know, respect that they don't want to disappoint us. This young fella in particular, you know, he stayed home and he's like, see, you didn't see me on the night notes, eh? And so, yes, no, I didn't. So you're good, you've been good and stayed good. We like to reward good behaviour, so we then, you know, we say, well, let's go and do a cinema day for the fellas or something, and let's look at, go for a trip and up and go for a drive and you know have a yarn and debrief and what's you know troubling you at the moment or what are you you know worried about so fred quite often does take them to have a debrief and have a little follow session with them and they do like that and they all you know they love the girls as well um that and they all you know they love the girls as well um but yeah we kind of just support in everyone that we can cool um so that yeah and what's is is there a i'm guessing at the moment the referral process is quite like um um agile and like um relationship-based? Is there a process that you're working on as well for that? Yes. So our process for referral is through this Operation Luna. So Operation Luna is, like I said, all the government agencies and heads made up from Territory Families and the Northern Territory Police. Yeah. So who's been sighted uptown, who's been, you know, the CP investigation, child protection investigation, who's on their radar. Cool. So therefore we would get, we would be able to get people referred from us, to us from the to us from the um operation lunar and so they're our most um vulnerable and at-risk young people so just attending a meeting last week there aren't really many young people on there um we do have two young people on there at the moment. However, they've been doing quite well in terms of, yeah, other, you know, young people. So, however, we're also able to get particular young people that are family and siblings of whoever we're working with because we want to be able to get everybody on that same page and support them. So we've got a few sisters, a few cousins, and a few brothers, which is great. And in particular, you know, one particular bloody language group at the moment is really what we've got cool um that's good and one one um one thing i was just thinking about is like how would you describe yourself in terms of like the part of the ecosystem do you think like do you so are you self-fitting, say that Project Operation Learner thing, do people almost be like, oh, this part of the program will fit specifically with yourselves? Or do you find that you have to almost explain to them each time why you think you can support those young people? Or do you think there is like specific things in which people already know that's like oh this is why i'll refer them across to this program like and yeah are you do you agree with what they say i guess yeah i think pretty much that when we first started we pretty much got all the young people that every other service couldn't handle. Right. Every other service. It's a pretty good way to describe yourself. They couldn't handle, they couldn't engage, they couldn't get things done. And so they kind of, well, this is the last resort. And so they've kind of referred us. And even last week they were looking at referring some young people. I think I kind of just, yeah, because they know of that strength base that we do have. It's culturally led Aboriginal authority and Aboriginal guidance and support. And so people do look for us in that even you know the manager for yorks the manager for all of the services they'll reach out look what do you think around this what can we do here so always look for that cultural um guidance from her and so we have now played a big role in this business. And so we're leading the way in case management, plan meetings, setting those up. We've got directing what needs to be done, who's taking action and what this particular young person needs. So we've really, this coming, the last coming six months, we've taken the lead on many youth programs and meetings and stuff like that. Cool. One of the Congress, one of the services have lost their funding. Is that Soulbush Enterprise or no, different? Sorry? Is that Soulbush Enterprise or no? Different. Sorry? Was that Soulbush? No, Back on Track. Oh, Back on Track. Okay, cool. Back on Track Congress, yeah. Congress, cool. So Toby rang Fred this morning and said, look, we've got all these clients that need to be referred. And Fred's like, oh, how many how many you got and they're like 20 and then Fred's like oh we can't take that on and he's like well what am I and because but I'm at the same time what 20 clients do you have that what are you doing with them what have you done with them so congress have always you know challenged us since day one right and so it would be interesting now all right well what are your 20 what are they lacking what have you done with them because we've taken about three or four from the start from back on track yeah and one in particular young girl she had a lot of challenges that we were working with um you know in terms of not being able to support her to get to school they weren't nobody was able to get her mental health assessment it made nobody was able to get her um health checks done or anything she'd been working with us for a couple of months within maybe four or three four or five months we were able to get her doctor's um health check done yeah we're able to get her mental health assessment done we're able to set her mental health assessment done, we're able to set her up with her own sentiment payments to give her a bit of independence herself, we're able to get, you know, set her up MyGov and Medicare and all of that, and she's now off Operation Lena, she was back on track for two years, and they hadn't been able to do anything with a young girl. Shit. And so we were able to, yeah, and it was great that, you know, Operation Luna acknowledged the great work that Unchakable was able to do. And able to be successful and achieving this way down the path. But yeah, it was really good because, you know, she's now off Operation Luna. Out in community. Comes in and out. Now she's back in town. But look, she's getting old enough to know that she needs to advocate for herself because a lot of the family aren't able to and no other services want her. So, yeah, we've been able to, yeah, kind of give her a little identity now and support her in that. That's cool. We're just about out of time, but that's okay. Are you okay to go for another five, ten? Is that okay? Yeah. Awesome. we're just about out of time but that's okay are you okay to go for another five ten is that awesome um one thing i was really interested in is um like there's the support for the young person and i think you was talking about it before but there is a ripple effect across family um whether it's through kinship or whether it's through just like people around or whatever is that something in which you talk about in in the work that you do in terms of your impact do you do you think there's a consideration of the work you're doing with that young person how that's rippling out to the whole family or other services maybe picking up that sort of support work and how do you think that sort of in the realm of what you do how much impact does that ripple out I guess to the whole family when you're working with those young people yeah yeah yes we we definitely have a really strong connection with our young people and their families. And so, for example, you know, we've got the grandmothers talking to Megan and Sam instead. We've got their uncles, their grandfathers. We've got everyone knowing who we are. But also knowing the connections, who we are as well. So, um, Fred in particular is, um, he's a, you know, young fella for them mob and he's another nephew. And so they always, they, you know, the family will growl at them kids. You've got to listen now. And even for Megan, she's a, he's he's there great now she's there grandmother so PB so you know they always you know look for me again and tell me as well but the services they really look for great Megan and tomorrow because they're the ones that know they have we know that they put the connection they know they've got the connection with the young person, the whole family. And so that ripple effect has kind of gone with all the services. I'll get in touch with Fred. He works closely with Robby, who's an Eastern Islander kid, Central Islander kid, and he knows the family and they listen to him, you know. Then they'll go like, oh, well, let's team up with Megan and Tamara because we know they're working really well with the girls. So like Tanya highlighted for the schools, let's get them girls to come into work because we know that they're the only ones that can control these girls and ground these girls and get them to do what we want that's awesome that's so good um this is kind of the last dish sort of question but maybe the most important um in in building the website there's obviously a reason to do it and one of them's probably how it supports you to grow and be supported by others is there is there something in which like if you think about if someone sees the site and they have the resource to support you um what do you think you would say to them around like the how you would use that that resource i guess like how would you explain to them as a philanthropist or as a government um funder or something like what's the what's kind of like the from your own mouth what's that um what would that resource do to support support the organization i guess sorry you just um dropped out there that last bit, but I think I heard, yeah, Tanner and I just kind of talked around, you know, basically that mentoring leadership, we're able to guide them in being young, independent, young people in strength in living in both worlds, you know. Awesome. Yeah, and I think the breaking the cycle, but that's based as Aboriginal-led and for traditional owners, working with traditional owners, working with language groups, many Central Australian language groups, and connecting the dots, really, and being able to be in a position to do that well. And we've got, you know, evidence already that we've been able to do that. Amazing. So we want to continue on building on that. Yep. Reduces crime, reduces, you know, intercepts the behaviour. Yep. I think just, yeah. That's awesome. And probably the toughest question, how much do you need? Oh, look. What do we need for 12 months? Yeah. We're just doing our budget stuff. I think we run at the moment. What was that? They were able to roll us over for one point. Yeah, the 1.8 was for 18 months. All right. Yep. And do you have something in with the justice reinvestment crew now at the moment? We did. And again, we were unsuccessful. Right. Right. And that gave us a bit of a headache. And were like nah, stuff will be alright. Did you get feedback or nah? No, not yet. Okay. That's one for me to chase up. Yeah. I can get on to them. And I had a really quick look at that walk thing. That's super interesting. What's your part in that, I guess, and what's the dream, I guess, from your perspective, how it will support you guys too? So we're traditional owners. We want to be able to bring these young people out on country to be able to, you know, team up and do that tour with us, being able to run things out there if they were interested. We're also in the process of leasing a grazing licence out there, so teaming up with Hewitt Agribusinessiness which is a big cattle company yeah and that way and so awesome where yeah there's so much that we're looking around that as well and why because a lot of these kids come from you know elders who were stockman yeah elders who knew the land, elders who knew how, you know, look after cattle, look after horses and all of that and grew up in stock camps. So we want to be able to share that strength with them as well and bring that mentoring ship with the elders, with that young fellow or young girl who come out of country and do something similar so we're looking at getting some cattle and just doing it around our little area while they lease the other bit all right and it's would would you classify that as a social enterprise or is it more just like um indigenous know what I mean? What would you classify that once that was going, you know, or not sure? Yeah, Indigenous business. Dad's got his own business at the moment. And, you know, he's got a gradering company we've got as well. Yeah, cool. We're managing. Cool. And he's wanting to, we're putting in a grazing, sorry, the gradering contract for three years on the Eastmax, and that's all our country that way. So Dad wants to then, you know, do all these machinery jobs, you know, and getting real jobs out in the community and learning and training. So good. So good. There's one little last pitch that I wanted to share with you and feel free to say just maybe or whatever. But I think I told you I'm working with the Diagrama crew from Spain who came and did the NT commission stuff. So I'm going to be going over there twice this year and we've started to create a bit of like a list of people who would be interested in coming over. I was just wondering if that was something that you two might be interested in in terms of representing Australia and your local area to come. And like it basically just means that we want groups from Australia, especially groups that have local knowledge, to be able to come over and sit in the youth detention centres over there and understand maybe what might be the difference between what they see there and what is currently happening in Australia and almost, like, listen and learn to diagrammer stuff through a translator as well. You don't have to know Spanish. But, yeah, I'm going to start pulling together some dates. One will be April and the other one will be September. But, yeah, no pressure, but I'm just flagging that and I might send you through some dates in case that might be something you'd be interested in doing. Oh, look look that sounds amazing and i think the opportunity will be definitely worthwhile cool i think because you know we're having working with the judges that we've got on the bench at the moment yeah we can make some real changes with our bench that we've worked with for many years in the legal space. And Woody and Carly and Anthony, the ones that we worked with through our legal career, we're in a position to kind of navigate that and kind of guide them too. So it would be really interesting to kind of see what else we can throw at them to change for us. Yeah, so the kind of, I think it's three-ish kind of areas we're really interested in testing and engaging with to get people's perspective is, A, what does the Indigenous Australian lens look like from a culturally different perspective when you're going to Spain and thinking about how that model might or might not work within that context? The second part is almost like ministers and people that can change legislation because we'll need a bit of legislation change for modelling stuff. And then also possibly some of the legal stuff where it's like some of the magistrates or court representatives that could support that more education rehabilitation focus for centres in Australia. So, but yeah, more to come. Our dumb legislation around locking 10-year-olds up is ridiculous because, you know, a lot of our lawyers are challenging that and using the Dolly and Kitak's legal argument that they're not capable of making, you know, these decisions. And so a lot of our young people are being withdrawn, charges withdrawn. And so it's so dumb that they've put in that legislation when you've got a legal argument already ready to go to state that our young people that you're locking up, they don't have the capacity to make those decisions. So it's so dumb that we're, rather than building programs that are meaningful and supporting the young person and the community and the family, they're rather locked up and then our lawyers bite that and challenge that in court like dumb so yeah that's yeah it'd be really cool and one um one quick one do you do you know tony mcavoy uh he's a barrister yeah yeah what's do you have a take on him or good or bad or what something or what's your take on it well i he's he's in he's he's currently applied to be a trustee with diagramma so um i was just wondering um if you'd had engagements or good or bad or i don't really know him so i don't know yes i know tony tony barrister. However, I think that he can talk the talk, but in reality, Bruce, we're still getting screwed over here. In Central Australia, you can make some really good outcomes. You're great in terms of land rights and maybe title. At the moment, we're getting screwed by Central Land Council. You know, you'd be in a position to kind of have these conversations with many traditional owners. And I also think that, you know, even around Aboriginal people in Central Australia, you could do so much. You know Alice Spring's been in the media that long. Yeah, totally. Why haven't you reached out? Why haven't you done that? So I think Tony, he was originally a part of, John Rawnsley, John Rawnsley is another bloke that, a lawyer that we used to work with. And so John and Tony are quite good mates. And we've met Tony a few times and yeah he teamed up with him a few times doing this true justice stuff. I think he's from legal specialty and I required a little land rights space. Gotcha, gotcha. So at the end of the day, he's close too. Yeah. So, you know, he's probably got enough on his plate with helping them up over there. Gotcha. Interesting. There was, he did, he did, there was something, there was something posted today. It was an article by Sophie Parsons and Maya George. They're defence lawyers. You know them? Sophie used to really close, she passed George. They're defence lawyers. You know them? Sophie used to really close. She passed away. Oh, hectic. They're, yeah. Oh, sorry. No, sorry. Roll Sophie. I don't know. Sophie Parsons. She's a lawyer. Yes. She's, do you know her father? Sorry, that's, her father was the first lawyer here in Central Australia. Hectic. At the Aboriginal Legal Society. He's a barrister. John Parsons. I've got his number. Yeah, Sophie Parsons is John Parsons, isn't he? I will... Remember he came for your National Indigenous Legal Conference? John. John Parsons. Hectic. He's a big top barrister. No, judge. Hectic. Yes, he's the judge. He's the first lawyer here, yeah. I'll send you through. He's really good. I'll send you through the PDF because, yeah, it's like a write-up of the Royal Commission detention stuff that was shared today. I had a really good read. It was super interesting. Yeah. And then, yeah, and then the other two people, I guess, I was, I think I told you last time that Olga Hanvan was. Olga. Yeah. And you know her kind of, or not really, or. Yeah. Yeah, Olga. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think she was at Danila dilba yeah for for a while and then yeah and then i don't you probably won't know won't know this lady her name's gabrielle trainer um she's um she has um been around for ages um just in terms of this like um boards and private sort of infrastructure stuff okay it's i think she's from victoria so it's Been around for ages just in terms of this, like, boards and private sort of infrastructure stuff. Okay. I think she's from Victoria, so it's probably like... But, yeah, they're just people in the mix for diagrammers sort of stuff. And, like, David from over there is kind of just winging it because he's just getting recommendations from anyone, right, to be a trustee. So, yeah, just checking in on some people, I guess. Yeah. I don't know Sophie personally, but I think her father, yeah, like I said, yeah. I knew my grandfather from the set up from the legal service. Um, Tony McAvoy, like you said, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's just, there's just so many people that like i find there's like lots of talkers and relationship people and then there's the doers and it's like it's so hard without like understanding context to to know because i know some of the most amazing people that never you never hear to hear name, but they're doing incredible work. That's right, yeah. And it's just that balance of not, yeah, not trying to engage. Like I think Nick called them something the other day, something like just board sitters, people who sit on boards and just like that's all they do. Oh, we know plenty of those. sitters people who sit on boards and just like that's all they do so the newest thing is that um the attorney generals for the northern territory have asked um that narja need to get rid of all their board members and we're like we've been saying it's true you know they need to do a clean sweep yeah it was a shit show that should never have happened. Yeah. And, you know, and the legal space is such a really small network of people. Yeah. And if you, you know, working with Woody, David Woodruff, who's on the bench here now. Yeah. He really does. Oh, I met him the other day. That is David Woodruff? Yeah, because one of my mates was staying with him in Alice and he was just, like, just chilling there. And then he was on the call and he just looks like, he was just sitting in his chair, looked like some old fella that just was, like, out, like, drinking tea and just, you know what I mean? Like, he was a very understated fella, but doing amazing work, right? Cool. Yeah, he's a very understated fella, but doing amazing work, right? Yeah. So, yeah, we used to work with Woody. Cool. Yeah, he seemed cool. And Woody's one of those soft-hearted fellas that, you know, give you really understanding and a glimpse of a different perspective, which is amazing. And if you get a chance to hear him talk, and we always get him to talk for our students when they come out. So cool. And they love it, you know, because he's able to give them a really deep and meaningful perspective from an Aboriginal person. He was with Matthew Pignani, you know him, from Social Traders. He did a lot of work in the Royal Commission as well. Oh, okay. He's an interesting fellow, yeah. Okay. Nah. Yeah, cool. Cool. Yes, but yes, we know them board seats and we don't want them. Amazing. You know. Cool. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's super interesting with the justice reinvestment piece. Like, I mean, they asked me for a meeting a while ago to talk about, I had a concept of, like, creating, like, a platform to help justice reinvestment stories get shared. And, like, it's very slow. And I think they're caught up in government protocols and procedures and they're really only worried about, like, who owns it and who's gonna make money out of it and I was like I really care like if we could just yeah and so like this is they begged us to apply again and we're just like and they still denied it you know so so weird yeah really so it'd be interesting to see what who has been funded but also what they recommend or what they're finding so I reckon you can totally sneak in anyway and just like we're doing a lot of work with like Stradbroke right and they're they're doing he lot of work with like Stradbroke, right, and they're doing heaps of stuff. And I'd love to almost like have you as a core partner in terms of just updating you on what they're doing and working on like, because they're working on a partnership with Mount Isa and Brodie, right? There's no reason why you couldn't do a partnership as well, doing something similar with some of that cross-cultural engagement stuff with kids and um yeah i think i think it's just continuing to show what you're what you're doing and like nick and i especially like at a curious tractor we like i think when we get denied stuff it makes us more hungry and so we just like end up doing it ourselves so whatever yeah whatever we can do to help you continue and especially because it sounds like you have a really great opportunity to leverage other forms of revenue possibly um across this stuff so yeah if there's anything like we can do to help with that stuff um yeah like nick's pretty close like with social um enterprise type stuff and business stuff. So, yeah, always interested in different models of revenue and whatever. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, we'll wait to hear back from our feedback and keep you posted and let you know. Yeah. Awesome. And, yeah, I'd love – I think – is it Larapinta Trek? Is that the one? Is that what it's called? Yeah, Larapinta Trail. Yeah, because I don't know if you know, do you know the Snow Foundation? They're from Canberra. Oh. So they do this thing called the Deadly Heart Trek. Right. Is that the, and I thought that was Larapinta Trail, and they actually had a lot of problems this year, and they've had to cancel it because they've had issues engaging with local people across the track and about, like, why they're doing it. I was just wondering whether you had heard anything about that. No, I know that they had a big joint management meeting out that way, so maybe that got brought up then. I'd love to just work out a way where I can get you in the game with them just to talk about what you're doing because essentially what's happened is they've cancelled their track because there's been issues. And if there's any chance in which you would like or be interested in supporting them to re-look at something, they're like Australia's six biggest philanthropic family they're in the canberra airport so um i think any and where we do a lot of work um with them and currently getting supported with his betting project um it might it might be i'll feel there a little bit more with nick but it might be something in which we can just do like a warm introduction um and you could meet with their um because they do they do mostly Canberra stuff but they do some remote stuff and it's mostly around like um health but they're but they're like I think always interested in any wild ideas Nick and I have so um I think like it could it could just be like a a simple warm invite thing and talk about your challenges and opportunities, especially around funding. Yeah. I think also, well, the walking trail, the walking club here is made up of many doctors. Right. And so we're the ones that tricked this trail out for us. Oh, awesome. So it's Alice Springs Walking Club. And so when we were out that way, we were seeing a walker over the hill and we were like, what the hell? And so they were tracking that for us. But, yeah, I'll send you some info around what they were able to put together in terms of a site package, what they thought what this trail could look like. That was just the government one but i've actually got the map out of all the sites and stops and stuff if you if they were interested yeah but even dad talked about a loop from the homestead that they might want to track and even those doctors might that walking club might be able to put a package or put that together just think just a couple of dot points maybe send them through to me um i'd love to sort of engage them i know and um yeah we um yeah we're going to catch up with them next week again um in canberra so um yeah be kind to y'all all right rad we didn't get a chance to do Tanya's amazing bio, but she's here. I didn't email you. Amazing. She didn't email you her bios anyway. Amazing. But, yeah, no. Awesome. Super appreciative of all that time. And I know that, like, sometimes it's quite wild, like, ripping your heart out and trying to explain everything. So thank you so much. So next steps from here, I'll just have a bit of a play i think um i'll have a few summaries for you or a few page templates um and then yeah i'm in i'm in canberra most of this week and next week and then off to palm island after that and then i go off to um korea and japan for three weeks so um i'll try and do a bit of like a updated type thing. And if we get, if we get excited and want to launch something before the end of the year and we, we get radical, we do that. But if not, if, if, well, Tanya will be in Sri Lanka and I'll be in Europe. We can, maybe we can do like a joint call from around the world. Oh, maybe we can do like a joint call from around the world or something. Yeah, let's do that. So we're all big noting ourselves and travelling this week. Sick. When do you both go away? When do you finish up for this year? Tanya finishes up Friday. Cool. And I'm not until I fly out in three weeks time. Cool. Well, maybe, yeah, maybe I'll do a little quick update by the end of this week. But, yeah, maybe we think about a launch that's maybe like fresh new year. Let's launch sometime in the middle of January and, yeah, get it out. So when did you say you were coming this way? Yeah, so we'll be there a lot. At this stage, the first trip looks like it'll be February. February. Yeah, it's looking like the middle of February we'll probably be um around Tennant Creek um for a fair few fair few days but we can we'll fly into Alice so we'll do like maybe three or four days in in Alice and yeah if if you're if you're around and um like before that maybe we can have a bit of a catch up and think about like what's some stories that you'd love to love to capture. Would you like to give you a welcome and maybe a culture tour or something when you get here? I'll be pumped. I'll be pumped as, yeah. And yeah, it's always like a really weird balance for me of almost like i always want to capture everything but then also make sure i like lean into actually participating so um yeah we'll have a balance of balance of that and um yeah as as we go i might i might try and if it's okay keep sharing some of this stuff from palm and strati and um if you see things that you're like wow that's awesome that's in line with what we're working towards um that's where i get excited where it's like oh this is some really interesting storytelling that we could cross sort of reference as ways to tell your story as well so um yeah i'll keep sharing and um please let me know it sounds amazing cool thank you ben enjoy if you have i don't talk to Sounds amazing. Cool. Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Ben. Enjoy. If you have, I don't talk to you before you go away. Make sure you have an amazing time. I hope it's a really like good relax. I'm sure you're due for a bit of relaxation and time away. And I'll try and, I'll try and do the same. Yeah, you too. Amazing. Thanks, crew. See ya. All right. Thanks, crew. Thank you for visiting. See you. See you. Bye-bye.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "Tegan Burns\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nTeagan: It's over here, Tegan. Alrighty. Uh, yeah. Okay, can you say and spell your name for me? \n\nUh, Tegan Burns. T E G A N B U R N S. \n\nTegan, what are we doing today? \n\nWe are collecting wildflowers and doing a grave cleanup at the Myora Cemetery and also at the Dunwich Cemetery with the kids as part of the, um, Youth Justice Social and Emotional Wellbeing Holiday Program.\n\nWhat's it been like so far, about halfway through? \n\nUm, it's been a really beautiful day. The kids have all gotten really, um, involved and have been really busy collecting flowers. We went down to the beach and collected some shell and coral as well. Um, we've just had some stories shared from Aunty Evie about her memories of this place.\n\nUm, and her memories of the old people of this place. So it's been really beautiful, um, to share that with the young people in the community. This is something that we used to do when we were kids, clean up the family graves. [00:01:00] Um, and it was a really special time of sharing within family groups. You know, you'd be cleaning graves and your old people would be explaining who the graves belong to and, um, telling you how you're connected.\n\nAnd so I think it's really beautiful that we can continue that tradition with the young ones today. \n\nWhat's it been like seeing the elders sort of, um, you know, sharing this experience? \n\nUm, it's really special. I love days like this where our elders and our young people get to interact and, um, build those relationships.\n\nThe relationship and the bond that the elders have with the young kids in the community is really beautiful. And they teach and share a lot of their knowledge and stories with the young people. And I think that's really important for our young ones to hear those stories and to learn, um, about that history and the knowledge that the elders have to share.\n\nDodgin here, walkin around with your old people. \n\nUm, I think I, when I look back on it now as an [00:02:00] adult, um, I was learning and being taught things on a daily basis. Like everything that we were doing, you know, my dad would be teaching and sharing stories and knowledge and language names of different things.\n\nAnd as a kid I didn't kind of realise. the importance or the significance of it, but now as an adult and as a mother myself, I look back on all of those times that at the time just seemed like day to day activities. And all of the knowledge that was passed down during those activities. And so yeah, I feel very grateful that I was able to grow up and spend my childhood on my country and be able to learn and yeah, learn from my elders.\n\nThis is so important to justice that someone For all that bridge, like, how, um, how critical is programs like today in the whole \n\nSo, when we talk about justice as a community, we talk about justice [00:03:00] holistically, and justice is not just about contact with the criminal justice system, it's, it's health justice, it's land justice, it's about our social and emotional wellbeing and our connection to place and our connection to community, um, so days like this are so important to build that, um, connection for our young people, to our elders, to our land, to our country.\n\nTaking them out to see these significant places, um, also giving them a sense of pride and identity and being proud of who they are and where they come from and the knowledge that's kept in these places and the connections that they have with their elders. So days like today are so important. \n\nAnything else you want to say?\n\nUm, \n\nno, thanks.\n\n",

I mean, they’re tougher than here.\n And the security staff wear uniforms, there are no educators.\n We don’t need to go for a day. And from 10 years on.\n Oh, that.\n And can they go inside the center, or do they have it—?\n Not much, but a little.\n Okay. Any more questions? Another question?\n**Speaker 1:** Do you like KCDC?\n **Speaker 2:** Yes.\n **Speaker 1:** Do you know what country they’re from?\n **Speaker 2:** Australia?\n **Speaker 1:** Correct. Yeah, I like them. I like “Thunderstrike,” it’s a song I really like.\n **Speaker 2:** Oh, do you have 하겠습니다? You’ve got good taste in music.\n **Speaker 1:** Thanks! Musical queries from Australia. Xochimilco. What.\n**Speaker 2:** What do you like about this place?\n **Speaker 1:** It’s more open than “Especially” or “XD.” You can leave to your company [or “go out to do your errands”], be in a house, play ping-pong. … … …\n**Speaker 2:** Do you have an “educator” concept here?\n **Speaker 1:** Yes, you have an educator you can talk to when you’re angry. It’s more calming.\n**Speaker 2:** And what is it like being the only female in a house full of men? Can you ask her that?\n **Speaker 3 (to Speaker 1):** That’s for you—he’s asking you. He asked you how it feels to be the only girl while all the others are boys.\n **Speaker 1:** Bad. I want a female companion. Every day. You’re more feminine. Whenever the bus comes, he asks, “Did a girl arrive?” Every time the fare is collected, they ask, “Is there any other female in the house?”\n Yes.\n**Speaker 2:** And what sport do they all play? Do you play a lot? Do you do sports here or in school?\n **Speaker 1:** We have sports twice a week. And we go to a park and practice, anywhere we want. If we want to practice basketball, we can. Or do push-ups, burpees… Sports.\n**Speaker 2:** And what do you expect to do when you leave here? What’s next for you after you leave this place?\n **Speaker 1:** What?\n **Speaker 2:** What do you want to do after you leave here? What do you want to do? After you leave this center, what do you want to do? What do you want to do in the future?\n **Speaker 1:** I want to be sports. (Possibly “I want to go into sports.”)\n **Speaker 2:** What do you want to do, in general? Do you want to study, do you want to work?\n **Speaker 1:** I want to study to be a police officer.\n **Speaker 2:** Ah. Do you want to be president?\n **Speaker 3:** I want to be president. Police officer? Yes? I’ve had some police officers who asked. Yes. And those… The president, a good president. And you want to work independently—work for yourself. And you—try to get a university degree, maybe a special age, engineering, become an engineer, go to university, it’s a good job, you need good grades. And president is president, right? Maybe you should study law first, though I don’t think you need that much schooling. Well, studying law is fine, it’s fine, it’s fine… (people repeating “it’s fine”).\n**Speaker 4:** Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye…\n **Speaker 5:** Do you have something to show?\n **Speaker 6:** Yes, yes, something. Come on, show it!\n **Speaker 7:** He has some of my drawings.\n **Speaker 6:** Go ahead. Do you have anything?\n **Speaker 7:** He has my drawings.\n **Speaker 6:** But don’t you have some, Marilyn?\n **Speaker 7:** Ah, okay. Yes, I’m sure I have something. He surely has them, but he doesn’t want to show them.\n**Speaker 2:** Can I ask you how the relationship is with adults here? Because, yeah, I’m interested since we have poor relationships with adults in Australia.\n **Speaker 3:** The question is: how is the relationship you have with adults here?\n **Speaker 1:** There’s a relationship, yes.\n **Speaker 2:** Why? Why is that? How do you do it? Because in Australia we’re bad at relationships with adults.\n**Speaker 1:** Eh… The “salud” [unclear, possibly “atmosphere” or “conditions”] is more flexible.\n **Speaker 2:** Yes, yes, that’s good. That’s good. In Spain… In Spain… It’s not too hard to be in a gang.\n And that. Kids are a bit more hotheaded, normally. We’re normal kids, but we have problems with adults. We’re normal kids, but we have issues with adults. Amen.\n**Speaker 6:** What?\n **Speaker 7:** What? Oh, alright. I have another one, but the other one can’t stick.\n **Speaker 6:** Well, just so we get the idea. So you also like… to take a photo, right?\n **Speaker 7:** Yeah? Do you have a “nana”? [possibly “Do you have a lullaby?” or caretaker? Hard to interpret in context]\n Yes, they’re going to be famous.\n Take out one more drawing and you have them. Don’t be silly. Of course, it’s your moment. Now or never. They’re going to know you internationally. You’re going to become famous.\n **Speaker 1:** Really? Are you going to travel to Japan? He’s getting tattoos now?\nHe’s drawing. He likes drawing and everything. And he’s very interested in Japanese stuff. He told me he was going to go to Japan. He’s going to Japan now. I have the best drawing from someone. [Another speaker chimes in] But… hurry, you don’t have to outline it. I have to finish and everything. Ask him yourself. Hurry.\n**Speaker 2:** What’s up?\n **Speaker 3 (to Speaker 2):** Look. Are you asking if he has a YouTube channel?\n **Speaker 2:** Ah, do you have a YouTube channel?\n **Speaker 3:** Ah, no. Well yes, but it’s just for business, not for fun. It’s for the dream.\n **Speaker 2:** Wow! Fantastic! Very nice!\nAny other questions?\n **Speaker 1:** Yes, a question—no. Thanks, Jesús. Are there really that many kangaroos in Australia? [laughter] How many?\nYesterday, interestingly, there was a documentary on kangaroos in Australia, and I think there were something like 20 million or so. So in the city you don’t see any kangaroos, but once you go 100 or 200 kilometers away, you see them everywhere.\n **Speaker 1:** Yeah, in “Chubiabba” (unclear).\n **Speaker 2:** Yes, well, my wife’s family has kangaroos on their property.\n **Speaker 1:** They have kangaroos on their property?\n **Speaker 2:** Yes. So anywhere that’s flat—not in the mountains but most of Australia is flat—and then if you go to the center of Australia, you’ll see some that are two meters tall.\n**Speaker 3:** Can they be like domestic animals?\n **Speaker 2:** No.\n **Speaker 3:** In a zoo, you can feed them, and they’re very calm, but I wouldn’t do it. It’s not like a pet.\n They stand up on their back legs and can rip your stomach open. They’re very aggressive. But the bigger problem is that we have too many kangaroos. At one point, the army had to go in and bomb kangaroos in the center of Australia. The mice, because there are too many mice. Three mice, three kangaroos, yes, in British…\nBut when I went to Jordan, in the Middle East, Australian kangaroos weren’t so common. Australian kangaroos are very famous. They sell them. They sell them to Jordan. We have too many kangaroos here.\n **Speaker 3:** Slowly? Kangaroos.\n **Speaker 2:** Kangaroos? We have too many kangaroos.\nYes, because of kangaroo fights and all that. And we do have some pharmacies that have balms, and we have—\n **Speaker 3:** We do?\n Yes.\n **Speaker 2:** My grandfather is an Australian champion in kangaroo… (the conversation trails off, possibly talk about allergies or competitions).\n**Speaker 1:** Could you translate something for me? I’m really surprised that there isn’t an educator figure in the centers [in Australia], that there’s only security service. That really surprised me.\n **Speaker 2:** She’s surprised because you said there’s no educator in Australia and only security staff. She’s been surprised to hear that.\n**Speaker 3:** Yeah, I think—I don’t know where it comes from, maybe the U.S. or the U.K. But I think there’s less will to do it. In Australia, we are very risk-averse, and we keep getting more so, not the other way. And we don’t understand the future impact on young people. We’re not supported, I think. And it’s a society that’s quite afraid of risk. So what it tries to do is avoid anything that’s risky. If you think about adult prisons, there aren’t educators, there are only prison officials, which is security. That’s basically the same.\n**Speaker 1:** Exactly, yeah. And here in Spain, in adult prisons they’re beginning to do more reentry programs, workshops, training, formal education so people can get some degrees. That’s all pretty recent.\n Yes, not just that, they also have the role of an “educator,” but maybe just one educator for a module of 300 inmates—and recently maybe there are 8 or 10. Some are educators, others teachers. But there are countries that haven’t turned that corner.\n**Speaker 1:** But especially for minors it surprises me, because reentry or rehabilitation is important at every life stage, but with minors—who still have so many opportunities to…\n **Speaker 2:** Capacity for change?\n **Speaker 1:** Exactly, it surprises me.\n**Speaker 3:** Do you want to change what might happen in the future so that there is an educator figure?\n **Speaker 4:** I have a theory, and people there might dislike it, but I think Australia is too privileged, and people just look out for themselves and their property and their home. They’re scared— I think we’re too wealthy.\n **Speaker 2 (translating or agreeing):** Yes, I think so. Everything is “keep the problem out,” it’s all money, money, money, and they don’t think about anything outside of that bubble. Because if you watch the news, it’s all “They broke into your house and stole your car,” so that creates tension between: “I’m rich, I have a house, I don’t want people to break in.” So they become the enemy, right?\n**Speaker 3 (continuing):** His theory, and he says a lot of people in Australia wouldn’t agree with him, is that they’re too privileged, they have too much money, so each person thinks only of themselves and what they own. And since most crimes there are house burglary or car theft, that’s what really hurts you personally, right? “They’re stealing my money.” It’s just that, there’s no violence. They go into people’s homes and take cars. So they don’t think about the future, they only think about “As long as it stays away from me.”\n(They mention the cook entering, joking that she is the most important person in the center, along with more conversation about cooking and staff.)\n**Speaker 1:** In Europe, yes, it’s true there are two or three countries that work like we do. But for adult prisons, some countries are even further along than we are.\n **Speaker 2:** Yes, for adults, the issue is actually putting it into practice and the resources, but on paper, if you look at the projects—\n **Speaker 3:** And the legislation.\n **Speaker 2:** Right, the legislation. I mean, afterwards there aren’t enough resources, but it’s like minors at first—there were no resources, but now we’re more advanced. Some places are much further along… Germany, all the Nordic countries, but of course, they’re wealthier than we are, and maybe they have a bit better politics, so… things are different.\n**Speaker 1:** My uncle was in the countryside in Salmonera, and he was the only adult educator in two prisons. Now they have ten this year. So for him, it was like, “Okay, let’s push—” But on paper, the Spanish system is among the most forward-thinking. The model I was telling you about, which I went to see recently, is basically “good behavior modules,” with an educator, a security officer, and a psychologist. That’s a juvenile center.\n**Speaker 3:** Yeah, because in the Nordic countries, for adults, there’s not as much crime overall.\n **Speaker 4:** Actually, in terms of percentages, there is more, but you know, we’re 50 million in our country and they’re only 10 million. They have more money, they have oil, we don’t. And their politicians are much more open-minded—\n **Speaker 2:** So they allow for a lot of things in order to teach them. And it’s fine that it’s better than us, we can still learn from them.\n **Speaker 1:** Sure, yeah, absolutely.\n **Speaker 2:** I’m the one who’s always touring.\n **Speaker 3:** When you’re president—\n **Speaker 2:** You’ll take notice, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n**Speaker 1:** Well, any other question before we go?\n **Speaker 2:** No. Well, thank you all so much.\n **Speaker 1:** Thank you so much.\n **Speaker 2:** Just know that everything’s been recorded.\n**End of translation.**\n\n",

      "Transcript": "So what I'm going to do, I'm thinking, I'm trying to work out how to do this, whether I, it'll be good to know, to hear my questions or not. Because what I can do is maybe, maybe what? So I can put, I can put one here for me and then for both of you, maybe I can put it like, like there. As long as I don't move. Oh, well, you know what we could do? You could just, if you put your, if you leave your hand there, that's a magnet and that's like that. Is that all right? Yeah. Cool. I'm going to step back a bit so I'm not, my noise isn't there. So if you, the first thing, could you do your, both your names and spell your names for me just so I don't get them wrong? Is that okay? I really can't spell them. I'm going to spell them. No, I think it's all right. J-U-L-I-E-S-I-M-P-S-O-M. Mine's Bob, B-O-B-30-P-U-R-D-Y. Awesome. And tell me a bit about maybe the both of you to begin with. Like, how do you know each other? Only from here. Only from here. Oh. And how did that happen? How did that first, how did you first meet each other here? Well, I came to, Julie was here one day and then I came and we got talking and I said she lives across the road. I lived in the back. I've been here nearly two years. Bob's been here longer than me. That's five years, five or six years, I think. That's amazing. Well, actually, what I might do, because this would be way better if your voices were better. Do you want to clip that on your? I've got a couple. I've lost my magnet. You can click this here. And then my voice. You'll be able to hear my voice. So, tell me, tell me about what it was like to see Orange Sky, I guess, that first time. What was that experience like for you? What's that? I can't hear you, man. I'm a bit deaf. What was it like coming here originally with Orange Sky and seeing the van? Like, what did that feel like when you first? Oh, it felt great. Because I was paying a lady $5 a week to do me washing. And I said, oh, it's here. I'm going to do it. And she said, oh, it's here. And I said, oh, it's here. And she said, oh, it's here. But I just washing and drying straight. Especially for me and for Julie, too. Isn't that great? Well, yeah, I can't fit a washing machine. I can't fit a washing machine, either. In the unit I'm in, so. And how long ago was that that you first came? 18 months for me. Oh, wow. And then you come back again? Yeah. I've had to get out and then I've been back. And I've had to go back and forth. And I've had to go back and forth again. I've been here for almost five years and then I've had to go back and forth again. And I've been back and re-enacted it. And I've been back and re-enacted it. And I've done it again. And it's been really, really great. Well, yeah, I can't fit a washing machine. I can't fit a washing machine in there. In the unit I'm in, so. And how long ago was that, that you first came? 18 months for me. Oh, it was a couple of weeks later. Because I didn't know about it, actually. Then someone told me and then I came round here. I read about it on the notice board. Tell us about this place. Where are we? This is Hunter South Community Centre. Hamilton South Community Centre. And how did you know about this centre before? I didn't. I only lived just over there, so. I wanted to know what was going on and, yeah, any help and stuff like that. Because I'm not from this area at all. I didn't know this existed. Where are you from? What's your school background? I'm from down Lake Macquarie. I was down there in a house with my kids. And we were there for 16 years. And then the owner just up and sold the house. And couldn't find anywhere. And so I became homeless. And then finished up in a women's refuge. Broke my hip in the women's refuge. So, yeah, and then they put me here. Wow. And what's... What's life kind of been like for you over the last little while since you broke your hip and that experience? Horrible. Especially here. I'm just not used to this. Yeah, the fights, the drugs. And you've got a mental problem. Yeah, it's not... I get on well with him. I've no problem with it. But I'm glad I don't live in that room because I would have knocked him out. Yeah, he's my neighbour. He's not quite me, that's the Julie. Mm. But yeah, it's not a nice place. What's... What do you feel like would be good in terms of change? Like is it a move away and a different place? Like what's the best case scenario for you, I guess? I just want to have a room, bedroom, because I don't even have a bedroom. And yeah, peace. Like over here it's over 55s. And I would be happy to go over here. That's where I live, yeah. Yeah. And I'm happy to go over there. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about your situation. Well, I was renting off a minister of religion who was a complete raven lunatic, unfortunately. And he was about three times about that close to knocking him out. He was just a complete idiot. Anyhow, I put in for the Housing Commission. And it only took me about a week. Because I knew him, because I used to work at the CES in Centrelink. And I knew the people there. And I got a place in a week. And amazingly, he said he's going to ask me to leave. And I said to him, I knew he was going to ask me. I said, oh, I've got some news for you, you idiot. I said, I'm moving out. He said, oh, you should have sent him with. I said, yes. And I said, I know you were going to put me out. He said, yeah, I was. I said, I knew that. I said, because you're a complete idiot, mate. And why do you come in his own sky? Like, what's your situation, I guess? Why do you come to Orange Sky? Why do I come here? Well, I've got no washing machine. And I was paying the lady next door to do the washing, $5 a week. And I'd have to hang it on the line myself. Because she didn't have a dryer or anything. But that was all right. But I couldn't just come and fit a washing machine in. That's all there is to it. Because the son offered me, did he? Do you want a washing machine, Dad? I said no. Because every time I say yes, he buys me something. I said, my phone's just about stuffed. He brought me a phone. I wish he hadn't have bought me an Apple. They're the worst phones in the world. I just can't. I always have trouble with them. Yeah, yeah. And why? What was it like, I guess, first meeting? And why do you keep hanging out, I guess? Bob's a normal person. I don't know. We just, yeah, we just talk each other. Yeah. You're just mates, good mates, aren't you? Yeah. That's it. I'd be there like a shot if Bob needed me. Yeah. I mean, Bob can't protect me like I would want him to, how he used to be. Yeah. But yeah, like it's, it's the kind of place where you watch who you speak to. Yeah. Well, I do anyway. No, I'm not scared of anyone. I never have been, so it doesn't matter. Being on my own, I'm careful. And what's, I guess, I understand washing, but it's also like conversation and we're volunteers. Yeah. What's that like? Oh, yeah, they're great. They're great. It's good. Yeah, they're really good. Greg's unbelievable, though. What is it about Greg? He's the best guy in my life. Him, yeah. He's the fitness fanatic. I've never known a great bike. And a 61-year-old. Yeah, Greg's, Greg's really nice. He's gonna do that New Guinea thing, you know. Oh, I mean, he's unbelievable, Greg. And does long bike rides and long walks and, oh, runs up 2,000 steps and down, oh. That's how he does it. And what's it like having a place to go and hang, I guess? Like, is this, like, an important part of your life? Yeah. I mean, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I've been to the gym, I'll get myagram services.

Everyone wants to be frickin' Sonny Bill Williams. Alright brother, tell me your name and spell it for me first. Chris, C-H-R-I-S. Cool. Oh, Chris. What's the Chris story? Tell me in a few words what the Chris story's about. I was born in Nelson in New Zealand. I come over here in 1981. Cool. January 1981. They wrote a song about me. I was only 19. I come over here just... to teach Aussies how to work properly. And... because you can go so far in New Zealand and... and the rest of the family come over here in October, November. Me and my sister come over in January after being in the Sea Scouts and... went to a national jamboree and regatta and... and... Hastings and Napier in the South... North Island of New Zealand. We got back down to Nelson. Then we went from Nelson down to Christchurch. Christ... I went back to Nelson, stayed with my uncle there. Then caught the plane down to Christchurch. And... on the 24th of January... 1981. QF 85. Qantas flight 85 from... Christchurch. We left for our grand adventures of... going to Australia. Got off... I said, is this fucking Australia? I said, oh... I said... we were living on the Sunshine Coast. And... my first kangaroo was up at... Bribey Island. The first kangaroo I seen in Australia was a fucking dead one. It was a bit of road cool. And... and... ah... I... I... was built... worked on high rises, buildings. When I went to Sunshine Coast... there was two high rises at... Eredris. Ah... Aerodrome Road. Bound Neander on one side of the road. Trafalgar on the other. All 15, 20 storey buildings. Before that... we'd been here a week. Mum said, oh we're going... we can go to Gingin and pick... ginger. I said, can we? Well here's me, only been in Australia... about a week. In the freaking Queensland hot sun after being... in one of New Zealand's coldest winters... pulling ginger. I said, Mum... you can stick your fucking ginger up your ass. I said, I'm not freaking... I said, I'm... I'm finding a decent job. That's when I went... That's when I went on the high rises and building and... Yeah. Then I... had enough of the Sunshine Coast, went down to Brisbane. Stayed with my auntie down there. Got a job down in Brisbane. Rode a little... 175 bike from... Sunshine Coast down to Brisbane. Rather than single carriageway each way. I'd hit the freaking forestry and freaking... Beewah there and freaking... Lansborough and come out and freaking... Then... Yeah. I didn't want to freaking... get... I didn't want to... I didn't want to freaking... take the traffic on a 175... trail bike, eh? But nah. Then went down to Brisbane. Up and down the Queensland coast, chasing work. Like you do when you're in the building trade. And on the way down there... I... Christopher chased and bezeled all my money in Quintex... when they built that... Sheridan Mirage Grand Prix... Sheridan Mirage Resort at Port Douglas. Then I... left there in 1988. Went down to Brisbane. That's when they had Expo 88. I was working down there and... worked a few different places like... Mako Kitchens at Virginia and... yeah, that's when I was pretty young... a bit younger. And... What about now? What's going on now? I'm a DSP pensioner and freaking just a worn out unit. Just trying to enjoy life. I'm up here... catching up with my son... who didn't really know his father... because his mother was a... the local push bike. And... now he knows me as his father. It's good. And... I'm... got diabetes and freaking chronic asthma. Chronic asthma, freaking... bone on bone knees... and freaking... osteo-rematurator arthritis right throughout my body. I started work when I was 14, 15. My body's just... worn out. I've been on the DSP pension since... 2010... 2015. And... waiting... Does it make it tough to live and to get by or...? Oh, it is, eh? Well, I've taken a few pictures for Chris Picton... our local member for Karrawarra... in South Australia... to show him... that... how to cure the freaking... youth crime rate... is don't give them a freaking skate park... that they freaking throw rubbish in. And... I've taken a couple of photos. I'm gonna... put them all together in a book. And... put it on his desk and say, hey... this is what you should do. Because five prime ministers... have come from my hometown in New Zealand... Nelson, top of the South Island. And... little Johnny Howard had to go over there... to see how the GST run... and the... daylight savings. He couldn't work it out for himself. And what's tough for you? You reckon, like, people like you... who are trying to live on the pension? No. Um... I... I would... want... I want to get back... to country. I've got a girlfriend that's... a bit younger than me. And... she works with indigenous. I'm... I'm... I'm an Australasian. I don't think you should become Australian. It's just... revenue munching. Which is... when you're Australian... Kiwi coming over here... that's just... that's part of BANZAC. Australian New Zealand Army Corps. And all that. You shouldn't have... you shouldn't have to... become... Australian. But alright. Now... now I've got Australian children... I thought... oh yeah... you don't lose anything. You... it's only stamped... I'm Australian on your head. But... at least I can speak English. I know... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... I know that... how to speak English... and I know the... constitution of... Australian government... not like... the Asians... or the... ah... Indians... ah... when... when... Australia becomes a republic... that's when I'll be... get me boat... and start paddling back to New Zealand. Eh? Because I don't want to live in the republic... with... ah... Asians... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... Brett Lawrence at Western... did you say Wolves of Australia...ster rapid lost four years? MOSES got... got... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... GOT... I had some washing to do the other day so I thought I'll come and do my washing. But down south they've got the portable vans that go round all the different day centres and all that sort of thing. And what do you think about Orange Sky? What do you think about the service? Nah, it's a good service. Well those blokes aren't worrying about their next feed now. They're alright. They're all round Australia, they haven't even gone across the ditch to New Zealand. And what do you think, how is it useful for people that come? Nah, it's good. They've got a story to tell. They're telling the story of their life and why they're in this situation. Because the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and there's no middle class anymore. And why do you think having people to talk to is important? Nah, because if you don't talk to anyone, it's a lonely life. If you can't have a joke and a laugh in life, you're a pretty morbid sort of person. And you don't have to believe everything on a phone. Who's Google? Has Google got mates? He's got relatives. He's got Instagram and fricking Facebook. Yeah, Fetch and fricking all that. And why do you think people come to Orange Sky to do the service? Ah, for a bit of community interaction and just friendship. Friendship and companionship and a life of friendship. And you know, I guess, it's a bit of, well, I don't know, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. But, it's pretty good. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. A lot of people are lonely. Some people are lonely. They live by themself. And they use it as service to meet people or congregate with the rest of the world, yeah. That's cool. And what's, why do you think that's needed in the broader Australian society? I think... They put it into a reason. Because, we were all born with silver spoons in our mouth. And that's one of... And the politicians only lie on their own nest. And they give themselves pay rises. And they give us a pay rise. Then they knock it off with another bill. And they say, oh, we'll give you this and we'll give you this and we'll give you this. But no, wait, we'll take this off you and this off you and something else off you. Yeah, yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. I'm just going to take a quick photo now. Is that all right? No, it's all right.\n",

      "Transcript": "I have a little clap here to get my sound. I always forget to do that. All right, if you just say your name and spell it, that's awesome to begin with. Melissa, M-E-L-I-S-S-A. And what's your last name? Leg, L-E-G-G. Tell us a little bit about yourself, I guess. I was looking for something to do where there's no judgment. I've got a pretty sketchy past and stuff. Actually, four months post-suicide attempt. So I came here about two months ago when I was ready to look at what I was going to do. It showed up on my Facebook feed and I know some of the people here through the community and stuff. So yeah, it sort of was a good plan for me. Just come in and volunteer a couple of days a week and it's turned into five days a week. Four days, just about. But I love it. I love it here. I love being with these guys. I love catching up with them, yarning, seeing how they're going. Helping them out where I can. Tell us a little bit about the community, maybe. I found myself, personally, to begin with, they're very closed off. Very untrusting because they've got a lot of cultural stuff. But once you spend time with them and you show that you're interested and you show that you actually care, they are very opening, welcoming. They take the time to have a yarn with me and tell me stories about growing up or their communities out bush. I've gone out and visited Ningymiah and Boulder Camp and just being a part of their stories. And now I get along really well with them. I love these guys. I love seeing them down the street. I love seeing them down the street. And saying hello. And I've got a 16-year-old daughter and she's come down here a couple of times and like, oh, we see her around. We'll keep an eye on her and make sure she's right. You know, she's 16. She's running around town with her friends and her boyfriend. And they always keep an eye, oh, I seen your daughter the other day and she was so happy and she said hello. And, you know, it's those kind of things that mean the world to some of these people because a lot of them are far away from their families. Like, they've got a little bit of family here but not much. And I like to count them as my family too. So, that's one thing that I love about this onshore. That's just so awesome. Tell us a little bit about, like, this vehicle that you're watching right now. It is. We'd be lost without it. Because, as you say, in the section I work in like we do store a little bit, but some of these guys, they're homeless. They have a blanket and a pillow and sleep in the dirt or in a sleeping bag. So, for them to be able to come here, and like, we do get donations. like I spend my time trying to stretch them out but they've been able to bring their own clothes here have them washed dried and then when they come back the next day they're ready for them to have a shower and so they're not always looking for stuff that I don't always have so I don't always have track pants or jumpers and so this makes a huge difference especially in this weather of them being able to have their jumpers and pants washed and be able to use them again The idea of our own sky I suppose is birthed from almost like an urban environment people experience homelessness and that idea of connection. How does that sort of translate to somewhere like gradually I guess? Well Ningamiah and Boulder Camp they are pretty much they've got a couple of houses with no windows or like shelters or tents and so they are effectively homeless and it just yeah like then it brings everybody here and it makes it feel a bit more of a home I had a friend come here the other day just to check the place out and she goes it feels more like a home because they can come here they can have a shower they can get their clothes washed they can have a feed they can we try and help them with everything that we can and just this truck and the fact that the Phillip can go out to Ningamiah and Boulder Camp and do stuff for people that don't come in here it makes a huge difference you know like when you're homeless I've been homeless myself and when you're homeless just having a clean set of clothes and a nice little bit of clothes makes a difference and we don't always have money so like even I struggle when I was homeless to find the money to be able to do my washing and I was in Perth at the time so I was trying to find laundromats and stuff like it's just one less thing that you can take off your plate when you're homeless because you've got so many other things to worry about How does collaboration work in community in this type of space? What does that look like? It's just all the organisations coming together. So like you said Orange Sky, we've got the One Voice Shower Truck, we've got Bega that comes here which is a health service. Centacare will pop in here every now and again. We have Centrelink that come and visit here. So that makes a difference. I've been to the Centrelink office and you can be sitting there for three hours. But we have a lady that comes in here for two to three hours a week. So they're able to deal with their Centrelink stuff and a lot of them don't understand. So we're able to help with that. We have some of the schools come in and do our cooked lunch. We have the short back and sidewalks homeless hairdressers come in now once a month. They've just started. So it's just all those little things that make a difference to the people that don't have access to this. So what's the... Do you have kind of like hopes I guess with the community over the next little while? Are there things you'd like to see change or things that you can change? More access to money that I know is available for these sorts of things. So I know that because this is run by a church, it's not classified as an essential service by the government. So we don't get government funding. Tracey? Yeah, Tracey has to spend time looking for grant money and donations and all that sort of thing to be able to keep our doors open. And I guess that's probably my biggest thing is that I'm so frustrated with the government that they are not recognising this as an essential service when it is. Like there's so many people that come here and use this service five days a week that we're open. You've got your regulars, you've got your ones that come in, you've got your ones that come back from hospital and they're waiting for the next bus ride to go back home. There's all those sorts of things and I just wish it was recognised more as it being important because it is. Yeah. Mariska, you use this terminology friends for people experiencing homelessness in terms of wanting to work out terminology that better supports connection. What's that word friends mean to you professionally and personally? Support. Understanding. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess those more than anything is just for me personally like my friends that I have they're very supportive. They're very understanding and it's the same here like everybody makes mistakes and you need to be willing to put those in the past and give people a chance and try and help them to do better. I know a lot of people coming out of prison like there's very little. No. No. No. No. No. No. very little support. There's not a lot of people that actually understand and I found that some people here find it better to be able to engage with because there's no judgment here. It's probably another big thing is no judgment. Yeah, the judgment thing is interesting, I guess, like from when I was based in Australia, the idea was dignity, non-judgmental conversations. Is that what you see here? Yes. Everyone's treated the same here. When you walk in that gate, you treat us with respect and dignity and we'll treat you the same. You know, like if you come in swearing or you're drunk or whatever, you're asked to leave. But this is a safe space. It's a family space. Like you've seen a one-year-old running around today, you know, up to however old they are. And it's got to be welcoming for everyone. And, like, I'm flat out all the time. Like pants, jumpers, towels, soap. But if I get five minutes to sit down and have a yarn and check in and see how everyone's going, that makes my day. It makes my day to bring joy to these people's lives. Just to be able to come in and have a warm feed, have a shower, get their clothes done, and be able to have some nice clothes to put on the next day or they wait around and they take them and they put their jumper back on because it's nice and warm, because it's on because it's nice and warm because it's just been dried and washed and you know that's giving people back their dignity just some clean clothes and if I can get in there and do anything else then that's and I I've been judged my whole life so the last thing I want to do is judge anyone else and I don't judge anyone by what they've done the past it's what you want from the future and if you want to go and get a job and if I can help you I'm going to help you like yeah\n",

What? Make what? Ula. Yeah. I don't know how to spell Ula J too hard of me. That's JUI. No, B. When you introduce yourself, how do you like introducing yourself?\n\nI always hold myself, Norman Frank. Gilbert War Man, a local war man from this country, from [00:01:00] Nan Creek. But, um, my, my, my clan group from up north are come from a place called Bur Country from Phillip Creek. Yeah, that's my totem. White Kakadu. That's where I come. That's from my, that's from my father's, father's side family.\n\nMy mother, my mother's, mother's side, she's a, she's a, she come from a place called. Oh, that place put from Creek, um, Ali Naali. Yeah, it's Wild Possum and traveled down from North that my mother's side and my, yeah, my father's mother's side from here. Local butter from Nan Creek. She's a Naga from this country.\n\nYeah. How, how do you feel connected to Tenant Creek? I get, I feel connected in Tenant Creek because of my father. My father was, [00:02:00] uh, of this country. He was, uh, the policeman and from his mother's side. See, and that's my connection here from for, for Butta here today, as we living in this time. With my kids.\n\nMy kids stay only third, fourth generation from my grandmother. Yeah. What's um, what are some things around town that almost make you. Like worry about things. Are there things that are not, not right here at the moment that, no, I think everything's all good. 'cause we've got, we got the what to wear more land claim and plus we've got a few sites in the matchbox in the township.\n\nOf Nan Creek, like one of them is the cultural center in Yin Cano. It's one of the, one of the sites dead center of the town in town. So that's very important for us here today as we, as we work and live in this time [00:03:00] today with the people in Creek. It's awesome to hear like a positive like mindset and perspective.\n\nHow do you keep that, how do you, how do you stay positive or look like? Well, we call them, we call them really, really, really good and with our culture and our, our, our culture and our, our connection, how we keep our connection strong here today and how, how we live in Nan Creek. I haven't really had a chance to interview anyone that's specifically helping Outra from Willy Jura.\n\nCan you gimme a little short, what is it? Oh yeah. Willy Gunter. Yeah. It started backboard nearly 20 years ago with me and Simon and. The way I used to live at Utopia and how Simon used to live straight across in the doctor's house. He used to live in the doctor's house, and I used to live across the road in the old tin shed.\n\nNot very big, [00:04:00] very small. One PowerPoint, one tap. And Simon had a big flash house. And then he said to me one day and he said, look mate, one day I am gonna build you a house. And I reckon, oh, in your dream mate. And then 20 years later we. We, we, we are there now and then we started a project, get a get get will down.\n\nThat's how I got Will, will. And he asked me, what shall we call it? Well, I said, you know, to us standing strong in Rimu, we call it Will actually, but we cut it short. Now we call it means standing strong in one. Yeah. Such a good explanation. Um, what's your, what, what do you see as your role in, in this, in this?\n\nWell, I reckon me, I want to see a better future for our kids and better housing for mb brandy people, not only here and for people, [00:05:00] for the whole nation, for everybody around the country. You know, we're all struggling today for housing and so, so we started. I started Will Gun with, with Simon, and now today we've got, we got a good, good team of US Mob working now with Willar.\n\nAnd because I, MEIA and my Mrs. Serena, she, the ones helped me, supported me all way along with, with Simon and especially with me and. Always been there with me and try to try, try to get things going. And so here we are today. Now, you know, we we're a, we've got a project and we've got a got a, you know, business going now and hope, hopefully we waiting for this first house to be built for me out, um, out on my block.\n\nAnd if we, once we get that going, it'll be like an display house. Like these people in Sydney. They've got, they've got these houses in Sydney to people to go and have a look at. But this one is gonna be for all brandy [00:06:00] people. You know? It is not only for us here today in Nan Creek, it's for everybody, for all different tribes.\n\nAnyone can come along and have a look and it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be very culturally and properly so that. People can have a better way of living and something change. We don't want, we don't wanna go. We don't want to live backwards, like how we grow up. We grew up back in the seventies and eighties and back in the nineties it was pretty rough at them times.\n\nNow we want to see better way of living for our people and our kids and better life. Why? Why do you think it hasn't happened before? Like it's a big issue? Well, I think, I think the government didn't work and the architect didn't work with us. And collaborate how we wanna live and how we wanna, how we want our houses.\n\nNow we got our, we've got our own ways sold so that now we can collaborate with our own people, not only here. It'll be everywhere. [00:07:00] What's, and a lot of people got different culture, different way of lifestyle, and our cultures are all different. So. If you're gonna work with the next, with the next community, with the next mob people, you gotta make your work with them and ask them how they want it.\n\nThat's just the way how many people work. And you don't walk into a community until you talk to the traditional owners and the S so that you can work and talk to what, what do you think the outcome is for the next generation coming? Well. Uh, me, I wanna see in the next, next 10 years, later on, next 10 years, I wanna see changes.\n\nI wanna see my kids leading William Guna and I take over and my grandkids as well, you know, because I'm just, to some, I'm just opening the gateway for them. Something that they can have something to work on. And. Work [00:08:00] with the country and with, with Bombi people around, around in the Northern Territory especially.\n\n'cause we, we, we, we found it hard here in the territory, back in from the flour and sugar and tea days working in stations and living in the on stations. And then when everybody got their rights back, back in 1977, then you know, we all got kicked off the station and sent back into town, then got dumped in town.\n\nNow we are here in town, we. We live in the way the government wants us to live now and, and put us in these houses. They just say you're getting a house, but you don't really own that house. That house belong to the government. Yeah. Um, partnerships are hard sometimes. How have you maintained good partnerships with Simon?\n\nWell, I don't mean him get on really with that fella. Well, you know, we've been mates for a long time. He, well, when I first met him, he was only a young, young fella from Sydney and, you know, he was a little city boy. Every time I used to take him out Bush, [00:09:00] I always tell him, Hey mate, he looked like you're suffering as Simon.\n\nWhat, what, what, what do you like? And he would say, I'm all right. And I, and I always say, you know what, if I was you, you know where I would've been right now. And he would say, where? I always say I would've been back there. I would've been sucking on an ice cream or looking on ice cream and staring at that bridge back at Sydney.\n\nThat's what I always say to Simon, and I still did use that today on him sometime. Yeah, he come from a long way, that fella. And how do you, how do you bring new people in and who, well, we bring new people in. We, we, we. We work 'em out how they are. If you can work along with them many people or government, that's good.\n\nFrom Brady, I believe you. We all should be walk walking together. It's like these two snakes. My logo got here, the logo, it come from my country. It come from a totem, from a place called Jim Cargo, and [00:10:00] that's why I use this logo today. It's not only from today, it's a thousand billion years old. Desire. My old people used to put this on Shields on the ground.\n\nAnd now we've got her on shirts. We've got 'em on everything now, now letterheads. So, you know, it's, it's, it's flying really quick. Mm. Um, what do you think this idea of sharing knowledge means? Not just from an Australian perspective, but around the world? Like, what, what does that, well, that's the only way you, it's, it's, well, when we live in new technology today, it doesn't take much to get that message out there.\n\nIt's only you, only you only, you only can get interviewed here, like now, today, you know, that'll, that'll be out there one day and then, then, then that'll be passed down to the next generation. Not only we keeping it today, it'll be passed on from, from my kids to their kids, to their kids after them. So that's why it's really good to document everything now [00:11:00] while we can.\n\nWhat a crack in sunset we've got going on here. Yeah, mate. It is. I reckon it's beautiful. That's my own. How much does nature play in the design of Willy Hunter's building? Well, it works with, with the climate. We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we work with the climates and the way how we sleep and how do we move around in the house with our people, with our poisons and our mother-in-laws and our father-in-laws and our son-in-laws.\n\nIt's, it's an everyday life. From us and we gotta learn to adapt to it and try to work around it and try, try and make us all one. But, but our culture, we have to still keep our culture. Our culture is very important to people. Without your culture, I feel, I feel I feel lost with my strong. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.\n\nI was gonna ask, like you seem like you have a very strong [00:12:00] presence and focus and passion. What, what's helped you get to who you are today? Well, my passion is my kids shooter and my future, my. My next generation so that they can see. That's why I always, well, you know, we, we, we always, we always have our, have our ceremonies.\n\nThat's just how our ceremony been passed down from, you know, from generation to generation. I like to see something of me getting, you know, interviewed like this now, like here today to pass that down to my next generation so they can see what I'm talking about. Your partner's over here trying to wrap us up should rouse on him because, oh, this fellow is telling us bigger.\n\nYeah. Oh, Simon, I think we need to do round 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 maybe. What, every time I come back we should do another catch up because. [00:13:00] Somebody else doing that as well. Amazing. Even, um, NITV. Oh yeah. It doesn't, they, they've been done doing a few now even they'll follow us right down to Canberra when we went there working for our first funding.\n\nCool. Yeah. So awesome to yarn. I'd love to keep it going. Oh, that'll be good. Yeah. So when the next time you'll be back Yeah. We're, we're back in June. June. June, yeah. Yeah. And then, um, yeah, we should be here every quarter or so. Reckon. Yeah. Yeah, I, I do a lot of work in Alice Spring, so. Alright. No worries.\n\nThank you. Thank you brother. You way. Oh, I'll grab this father off you. Oh yeah. Otherwise I'll take it home. I've had a few people take them home. Yeah. I keep having to buy new ones.\n\n",

That helps me sync up my cameras here. Alright bro. Yo, look at me. How about this? Oh no. Look at you. Just your full name and spell it to start off. Your, say your full name.\n\nRussell James Miller. RU double. SELL? Yep. James, as in James and Miller. M-I-L-L-E-R. What's the little James Miller story in a few minutes? James. James. My I've got a son who's I call Dylan, James Miller. Oh, Dylan. James Miller. Yeah. But James, I dunno where James come but Russell is my mother's.\n\nMother's. My grandmother's Christian name. Oh, sorry. Surname. [00:01:00] Awesome. Yeah, so she was a Russell. Russell and they chose Russell as the first name. But James, I dunno where James came from. Dunno. Tell us a little about yourself. What's the little yarn that you like? I'm an old geezer now.\n\nI've been retired for a few years. I was a teacher for 40 years, did teaching for 40 years. I was married for 36, but I'm not anymore. And live by myself. But my son has just moved back from Queensland. He worked up there for 10 years and he's come back and he's, she lives in a. Flat himself got a house he rents, but nearby.\n\nSo we see a lot of each other, which is nice. We're very close. But I love my fishing and I've got some good mates and we go away fishing regularly and that's one of my great interests. And I've got a big garden, which is good. I like romo and veg and organic veg and things like that yeah.\n\nBut yeah, that's my story in a nutshell. How does that link to Iron Sky, your story? I came back from Queensland. When I retired, I [00:02:00] bought, I had a house in c Cremorne. We, my wife and I, ex-wife and I bought a unit up in Redcliffe and we just having a winter up there, summer down here. It was perfect, ideal for few years.\n\nThat didn't work. When I came back, my mate, Greg Cook he was work, just started working with Orange Sky and said, look. I was at a loose end. He said, why don't you join us? And it was great. And it was one of the best things I ever did in a way, because when I just thought my life had come to an end.\n\nBut when I came and worked with Orange Sky to here, I've always come here and see how other people's lives have panned out. I suddenly started realizing, my life's not so bad after all, putting it into context. Yeah. And it's been a while. What keeps you coming back to this nine years?\n\nIt's been now and looking at next year will be the 10th year. I know that the people really love having us come here and they, and a lot of people have said they've made, you've made such a big [00:03:00] difference to me over the years and I think, I just feel it's great to be giving back to some people, and I love the situation where we can do a clean wash for people and have a good yarn to them.\n\nAnd we've made some good friends over the years. I. And I love it. I wouldn't give it up at the moment, so that's why I'm keeping on coming. That's cool. Yeah. It's some good people. What's like the, is there any effects on you, do you think, that other people wouldn't consider in terms of volunteering and why you do it?\n\nAre there certain things that have changed within yourself over the time that you've noticed or what's that? Oh I've always been pretty tolerant. Of people's differences. I think everyone's entitled of their own opinion and things. And look, when I come to these shifts, it's all about having fun and having a laugh.\n\nAnd I think it's good when people in the house hear us laughing and having a good time that brings them down, they love that sort of thing. I dunno really what to say in that respect. I just, I'll keep coming back because I [00:04:00] enjoy every session we do here. It's great. I like meeting the new volunteers.\n\nNo new. We've been the same shifts now for so many years. We're not looking for anyone else. And what's your, is there a vision or a mission or thing that you're working towards? Or is it just about turning up every day? What's the, I think consistency to be consistent and be reliable.\n\nAnd always, the van's kept here, it's parked here, and other shifts come and take it away to be used, but it's parked here. And I just, I want to keep coming because they rely on seeing, I think it's important for these people to see that we are consistent. They've not had consistent in their lives. People have let them down.\n\nSo society's let 'em down in lots of ways. So I think coming here to do that I'm not gonna give it up because of that. I think they we owe 'em that, yeah. What's like a general thing that you think the general public get wrong about people who are struggling with disadvantage? Oh, that's a good point.\n\nYeah. [00:05:00] Often people say, they're not, they're everyone who lives in this place or comes to stay in this place have a story behind them and there's a reason why they live here. No one would actually choose to be here. So there's always something that's. That's led or them to them being here. And I don't think a lot of people that don't ever see people like that or talk to people like that live here, to our friends that live here, they don't understand the sort of people that we're dealing with.\n\nThey've had very little choices in their lives, so I think, that's the problem. People don't give them a chance. They don't want to talk to them. They see some of these people walking down the street. They wouldn't want to know them, but in actual fact, they're good people. We're all good people, basically.\n\nHumans are good people. I think there is a difference between, it broken down a lot of things for me. Having seen, met these people I always felt a bit challenged by it, but not anymore. [00:06:00] And what about Orange sky? Do you think they're doing a good job? Growing, not growing track.\n\nYeah, I think it's good. I the essence of this is excellent. I think once they started growing, they've gone through a few teething problems as far as I'm concerned. It's growing so much that it almost becomes unmanageable and you lose that small, the family oriented feel, but I think they're getting it together.\n\nIt seems to work. And there's rules we have to follow with Orange Sky. I know, but in the end. Oh, can we stop? That's I think ring tone. That's, yeah. Oh, that's terrible. Pause. Can you pause it? Yeah.\n\nThis is scratch. Robin. Hey Robin. Did you get my, I did. I'm just sitting here. I've Ben's just paused the camera 'cause I'm sitting here talking to him. We should record this actually. We should have recorded it. Yeah.[00:07:00] \n\nSorry, are you saying any, are you saying anything sensible? Am I saying anything sensible? Get after? Yes. You'll, is there anything else you require? No thank you sir. Oh, I only got it when I was traveling, ah, and then I arrived here and it's been all go since then, oh, good. Yeah. Sorry about that. So you working?\n\nThat's good. Yep. Yeah, we've got a few loads bill's back on deck here and putting a few loads through, which is good. Oh, is he okay? Yeah. Oh, he is pretty, yeah. Not that really. He is just yeah. Anyway, he's going all oh good. Yeah, and I think he's decided not to go to another place now, so I think that's pretty, pretty much his thing, probably.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Trevor apologized to him for knocking him out.\n\nRighto. I'll let you go. Okay. [00:08:00] Go tell your live story. See ya. Okay. See you Thursday. Okay. Bye. Bye.\n\nSorry about that. She's keeping you in track. Oh, honestly. Damn. She's about to go. Yeah. Sorry. She's about to head off. Yeah, she's off. Yeah. Uk. Oh, London. What's today? Oh yeah, on Friday. Yeah, this Friday. Yeah. Yeah. So we're almost done, but all good. One thing, I'm sorry I go on a bit. I'm not No, that's great.\n\nI'm not Great. Going on is awesome. That's alright. That's what we need. Yeah. Yeah. So orange sky, like in 10 years, what do you reckon you would hope would happen? Is it the same, is it massive? Is it overseas? Is it what's, what do you think in your own mind would be? I'd like to, I don't mind it growing.\n\nIt has grown in massively in the nine years. You can imagine how many vans there were in operation eight years ago, and how many are operating now. I worry that it [00:09:00] gets so big. That the communication between the volunteer people and the headquarters, the top there, it gets a bit too clumsy. I don't want to be having to do too many forms peop people who volunteer don't want be restricted in always having to fill out forms and be.\n\nYeah, following this and following that I think they should encourage volunteers just to be doing what they do. That's what we do best. And not the administration. I do a fair bit of the administration, but it has changed with the new Myo system, I must say it's been a little bit easier. But I, yeah, no, I think I, I'm all for it expanding and getting more of these bands out because it's great.\n\nIt's a good thing. It's not just for washing, it's not just getting people's clothes clean. It's this connection. That's fantastic. I think and not, it's a different story here at Flint House because it's an old bo it's a boarding house. [00:10:00] There are a lot of the other shifts dealing with people who are actually legitimately homeless.\n\nThey are living rough and tough. And that's another matter altogether. But I think orange sky is gonna grow for sure, but just be careful that it doesn't lose sight of. The individuality of the volunteers, they've gotta be kept in touch with just in as humans, that's perfect.\n\nYeah.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I'd rather look at me, you can talk. Yeah. Tell us your name and spell it for me. My name's Graham, G-R-A-H-A-M. My father couldn't afford a newie, so yeah. Tell us what you're doing here today. Yeah, well I missed out last week, or last fortnight, but these people, they're good at doing washing, especially when your washing machine don't work for you. I like that, but I come even when it does work. What do you keep coming back for? Because I like the people that work here. I know, it's not a chore. It wasn't a... Yeah. It wasn't a job or a must be. It's more part of my social life. What's your current situation at the moment? Where are you hanging out most of the time? Oh yeah, I've got a place on that. Like I said, I've got a washing machine that don't work. Actually, it doesn't pump the water out, you know, on that. When I missed out a fortnight ago, I put it in the washing machine. I used the bucket to empty the washing machine, which takes ages. To do that, the spin dryer doesn't work properly, so that's why I'm here today. Do you come for the food as well, or the services? Yeah, but not all the time. I come here for the same thing, to associate with people. There's a lot of people worse off than what I'll ever be. What do you think about the general community of homelessness in Newcastle? Is it hard? Is it tough? What is it? For the homeless people, I think it's as tough as anywhere in the world. Like, if you've got nowhere to sleep and not much to eat, doesn't matter where you are, does it? On that, people, especially at church here, they look up. They look up to homeless as best they can. And Seoul does too. I worked for Seoul for about six years. I started to develop the wrong attitude, so I've given them this for a little while. But I'll probably go back to it. And it sounds like you're helping other people out too. What do you do helping other people out? Yeah, well, I help find them work. I put a few people, not many, up now and again. You know, and I used to do a lot of shopping and that, but I had an accident and that slowed me up. So I can't do that for anyone now. But I normally have a whinge to people when I see them on that and try and make them feel good. What's the community like here at Orange Sky? Is there lots of conversation and connection and stuff? How's that going? Yeah, 99% of it's great. They've all got positive attitudes. There's not many that haven't got it, but then again, they soon get it. When they get to know everyone here and get to know what's offered for them and all that, their attitude changes and they're always good to talk to. Not like me, I'm a pain in the backside. But yeah. Why do you think Orange Sky is important across the whole Australia? Because we offer this service everywhere. Why do you think it's good to have it everywhere? Because the simple fact is everywhere there's not people, well, they're doing quite so well. And they might only be down for a little while, but when they're down, these are the type people that help, you know, no matter what they do. Some, like yous do, yous do the washing. Others help feed them and others help clothe them and others help them find work or whatever. Or just someone you to talk to. And there's a lot of that in Newcastle. Like I come from Sydney and I find up here there's a lot of young people that think of others. When I was their age, I only thought of number one. But now I think different. So that's that. Yeah. So good. Thanks so much for talking to us. You're awesome. Okay.\n",

      "Transcript": "Well, do you know English? No, but... But to understand the question, yes? I don't know. Well, look, if you don't understand it, and I'll tell you. Because she understands a bit of English. Ok. Maybe I don't need to translate into English. Ok. But if I need to, I'll be here. I think you will have to translate for me better. Ok, and then, of course, I can speak a bit of Spanish, but no. But I think I will just do English and then do it. So, if you could say your name and your role, your job, and how long you have been working here. Social worker? Can it... How do you spell my name? Yes. C-H-E-L-O. Perfect. How did you start and why did you start working here? First, initially, I did it as an educator. I was an educator for five years. The rest of the years I have been a social worker. And well, the truth is that it was a journey that I think is interesting. To go a bit through the kitchen before, right? Being an educator during that period. And logically the profiles have changed a lot. The profiles from when I started as an educator now have nothing to do. Before... Yes, there were much more delinquent profiles. Now let's say a bit that they are the misalignments of this society, right? A lot of domestic violence. And well, and now from another look, from another prism, as a social worker, working with families, well yes, you don't see the deficit in families, but they give it to you. In the own intervention, it's the families themselves that are telling you a bit how this situation has been created, right? And why did you start working at Diagrama? Well... good, I really liked the theme of minors. And it happened that I was lucky that they called me for an interview. And they called me. And great. It's like a school this, continuously. Teaching. Why do you think it's important for young people to have a second chance and a more rehabilitative style, instead of just penalties and learning? Why is it better to be rehabilitated and not penalized? I got a bit lost in the... That's the question. I'll ask you. Ok. Why do you think a place like this is better to be rehabilitated than punished? Well... The boys when they arrive here come with something, with a wrong construction of what this means. So, when they come here to this space, to this structure, they come with a wrong construction of what this means. And they themselves start to discover all the things they are capable of doing and that outside they haven't done, of course, it rehabilitates much more that they can be sitting for six hours doing school, which many of them didn't do, the fact that they are taught workshops of skills, they are surprised, oysters, and this... And everything adds up, everything adds up in the construction of these kids. So, it's much more about adding and teaching them. And look, certain obligation, as rights they have, to do things. That is, we can't be all day locked in a room, right? Why? Because life is things, life is movement. So, everything that means adding and doing things, will always rehabilitate. What would you say to other countries that have a different style that might... or... from what you've learned here, to other countries? What would you say to other countries that have a more punitive style? What would you say to them? Well... first you have to believe it. You have to believe that changes in the structure always come because decisions are taken. If we don't make decisions, if there are no changes, we are never going to know. And, that's why, I think it's important that countries that have a more punitive style know how they are going to do. And, that's why, I think you have to have a way of doing things. If we don't make decisions and there are no changes, we are never going to know what things can be achieved. But it is true that when the structure works, there are answers. And here it is the boys themselves who give the answers. That is, what is offered to us? Training, work experience, coexistence, education... There are many things that will always improve. They will improve the structure, no doubt. What do you think the public thinks about what happens here? What do you think the public thinks about this style of helping young people? And do you think the public in general has a good feeling about what happens here? What do you think public opinion thinks about the places or the work done here? What do you think we do here with what there is? Well, there is a part of society that is very unaware of this work. Even there is criticism and judgment because of that ignorance. But it is true that when you meet people who know the work that is done and recognize the work, because it is not easy. It's not easy kids who come without scope, without rules, without limits, who come totally a bit lost. This job is not easy and when that recognition is given, well the truth is that it is gratifying because yes, there are many people who should know and learn instead of criticizing without knowing. But well, that's how it is. The plots of society. Do you have another question? One more? You? Yes. You? Yes, of course. What do you hope to do during the rest of your career? Do you have goals and dreams you want to achieve in your career that help some children? What would you like to achieve for what remains of your working career? What would you like to achieve with these kids? Well, that they know how to manage their life and know, that is, we cross the line once, we can't cross it more times and that they be happy and that they be good people. And for yourself? And for myself to be able to contribute to all of it. For me, it's super satisfying when you're with families, with friends, with friends, when you see that there have been those changes, those small modifications that are big things for them and for us logically, well, it's great all that part. Very good. Very good. Perfect. Why? For you? For you? That's it. Thank you very much. No, it's five thousand. For what comes out? A photo? For what comes out? A photo. A photo? A photo. For what comes out? A photo. A photo. A nice profile. It's here. Yes? Yes. Can I let you pass to do or not? No. There's no leader. Ok. Then I won't put it on myself. I already need it. Very well. Thank you very much. It doesn't give. Much slack. It's for the mix. Very well. No. Thank you very much. Finally. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcript": "Okay. Tell me your name first then. Suzanne. Suzanne, awesome. How do you spell Suzanne? S-U-Z-A-N-E. The French. Tell us where we are, where are we? We're at Christchurch Cathedral and it's the Horbury Hunt Hall on the Grammar School site. What do you get up to here? We feed the homeless and the underprivileged fortnightly. Wow. How long have you been doing this for? Well, Andrew's been doing it for about 16 years and I'd have been about 10. Why do you do it? What's the reason for you to do it? Well, there's a need, right? But it's also a very rewarding job too because you see the pleasure on their face when they come. And not only, of course, are we giving them the food, but it's also providing a social activity for them too that they can get together. Which, of course, during COVID unfortunately couldn't happen because we had to leave them outside and feed them, you know, hand them takeaway through the door. What are some of the normal sort of characters you get here? Can you tell me about some of the people that come? Well, as I said, there's the homeless and some of them actually sleep in the doorways of the cathedral overnight. We also have people... We have people that are impoverished. They might have... We have young families that have been put out of work. And we also have some people that are lonely and so they come along, you know, so that there's somebody here that they can communicate with. And also we do have some that have been released from jail and rehabilitation from drugs, et cetera. So it sort of covers a whole lot. Do you... Do you sort of think your upbringing or the work you did during your life like helped you to want to do this kind of work now? Or why do you want to do this work now, I guess, from your... Well, I came... Right. Both my grandparents were priests and I sort of grew up knowing that people came, you know, to the churches to be looked after and when they were in need. So there was that background plus the fact that I was also educated. I was educated here at the grammar school and the grammar school are part of this because students come along and they actually serve the meals and do the washing up, et cetera. What's it like being able to help kids sort of experience this kind of stuff? Like, what do you think? Why is that important? It's very important to be with the young people because, number one, it's a learning experience because some of them wouldn't realise that people aren't as fortunate as they are. And secondly, they're the future carers. So we have a learning sky out here. What do you reckon about that service? Oh, it's invaluable because it's giving them the dignity that they can actually, you know, have clean clothes, et cetera. Do you... What do you think about the opportunity to partner, I guess, because you're growing food or it's going to... Washing, why do you think that's important for the whole ecosystem and, like, support? Well... Well... Well... Well, it's showing them that people are caring for them and are concerned about their needs, all their needs. And, of course, what happens, as I'm sure you know, that they actually have the meal while their laundry's being done. Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah, it's wonderful. What keeps you going? How do you come back here? What's, like... Well, as I said, from a... from a selfish point of view, it's a very rewarding experience, which you'll see when they start arriving. And how long... Sorry, I've got to stop talking. How long has this been going on for? Oh, well, we're... This is our 40th year. No way. How does this continue to be supported? Is it through the church? Well, yes. Everything's completely voluntary and we have people on the roster. Now, some of them, for example, are on dessert, so they turned up... the cheesecakes. And some were on the roast part, so they might have had chicken or beef or lamb. And so it's all done that way. It actually doesn't cost the parish anything. How many people do you get in the farm on average? Well, we go from 60 up to 93. And how often is one to eight? Four times a day. And twice a year. Yeah. Well, the first one is that the grammar school... is the one that hosts the tournament of the mind. And they have students coming from all over the place. So we... The preparation's done here. The washing up's done here. But then the students carry the meals across the road and we feed them in the cathedral. And we do the same for Christmas, for their Christmas lunch. Yeah. And, like, people who come here obviously have a lot of needs. They need housing, they need... and all these things. Well... What part do you think... are in this stage of learning? Well, with the housing, you see, we can't ask anybody any questions because of the privacy. But we pick it up from if they start talking to us. And the associate priest of the cathedral, he comes over and has lunch with them, sits at a different table. So we can pick up if they're in trouble that way. But we have a book in our pantry that's actually for the emergency room. So if somebody's out on the street and homeless and needs somewhere to go, well, we can look it up and also refer them to the Samaritans for... if they need cash for something. And coupons for food. Well, this is wicked. I really love this. Thanks for yarning.\n",

      "Transcript": "Briget\\_Perry\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nBriget Perry: B-R-I-G-I-T. Yep. P-E-R-R-Y-R-Y. Cool. And would you like me to send this to you in email or telephone number or text? I think email would be good. Okay. What's your email? It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n\n",

There was a fella that was talking a lot about Brisbane and knew all the shifts and, but yeah, there was a few reasons why he didn't want to be on film. Had a lovely long yarn with one of the volunteers and I think she had some really great things to say, a bunch of things, so there should be a few short grabs there on volunteering, on perceptions of homelessness and there was some good service provider stuff there I think too. So, yeah, overall pretty quiet shift, but got some night shots and I think one nice profile volunteer photo with a few stories, so yeah, overall very generous and nice shift And Vinnie's came and we're doing some tea, coffee and hot cross buns and stuff.

      "Transcript": "It does wear you out. Cool, a little mic test, I reckon we're good. Sweet. Alright, just tell me your name and spell it, it would be awesome to kick off. And you can just look at me and yeah, just normal chat. My name is Richard Calligan, that's R-I-C-H-A-R-D, Calligan, C-A-L-L-I-G-A-N. Cool. So tell us a little bit about what you do at MINIS. Currently I'm the regional president of St Vincent de Paul. St Vincent de Paul has groups of people called conferences and there's about eight conferences in Mackay. Special works, like the one I'm usually involved in, which is St Peter's Prisoner's Aid Conference. There's parish-based conferences and there's about eight of them. And my role as regional president is to bring those conferences together once a month to discuss how things are going. Look at issues and try and provide some practical resources to people in need in Mackay. Well good. How did you first hear about Orange Sky? I heard about, well, I suppose over years ago, there was some publicity around Orange Sky's first presentation in Mackay when they used a van sort of situation and so I was aware of that. And then when I became regional president, I was told that Orange Sky was going to be a good place to do that. I became much more aware of the previous regional president. He had provided an opportunity for Orange Sky to use our resources here in terms of a place so they could be a much more stable presence rather than working out the front through a van situation. That's cool. And what do you think is the most important part of Orange Sky, I guess, for the Mackay community? Like there's conversation and watching and connection. What do you feel at best is representative of the impact? From my experience, it's been the... It's hard to separate the washing from the conversation. It's the... Providing that opportunity for people to wash clothes. And there's a... What I've learned is that there's a range of reasons why people may need to wash clothes, including the breakdown of your own washing machine. It doesn't mean your destitute or anything like that. It just means that you need an alternative. And I think that's great that that's provided for Orange Sky and the opportunity to talk to people. And that's connection, which is a lot about what St Vincent de Paul does. Orange Sky... ..schedules their visits here on the same days we have our family support days, which are opportunities for people to reach out to St Vincent de Paul and interact with us, to get some support in terms of groceries, or some other financial support to meet their needs. That's cool. What's the joint kind of value, do you think, with St Vincent's and Orange Sky working together? Does that create more impact if you partner and work together? I think it makes sure that this site... ..this site is utilised much more often than St Vincent de Paul. So it's a benefit to us from that, and the facility and resources that are available. We can make it available to one little group who then is able to make that available to others in the community. Just a different... We don't do washing, but we do provide conversation and we do provide that outreach to people. It's very... I can't think of the word, but it's very... It's not serendipitous, but it's certainly very helpful. That's awesome. That's awesome. What's, like... How do you represent the Mackay community in terms of the need for this? Like, is there a lot of need for this, and do you think there's, like, it's a growing need, or how's the community in general in terms of its, like, stability and people's... I think the thing that stands out to us is, like, irrespective of whether Orange Sky is here or not, that there's still people in our community who, through one means or another, need support. And we find that that's particularly around Christmastime and the New Year time, around the start of schools. People just need additional support. Maybe some of the money they have can go into rent and other utilities, whereas we can provide relief in terms of giving them some groceries or some grocery vouchers so that they don't have to spend that money on food. They can spend it on... They can spend it on other things. And that certainly is a very big demand around those two times I've talked about, around December and January. But around the cooler months, not that it gets too cool in Mackay, but, again, there's that persistent need, and it's been growing. And certainly working... Our retail stores provide the resources that we're allowed... that allow us then to share that with local people. And how do you think service providers and other support in general helps Orange Sky to grow and create better impact, like, in terms of around the whole of Australia, I guess? Like, why should other people partner with Orange Sky to deliver services? I think... It's... I think it's a bit of a novel approach. And people are looking... I think most people in our community want to make sure our community thrives. And Orange Sky is a way... Orange Sky is a way... is a way for people to contribute to the community in a very practical way, and without putting much demands on them. And there's no meetings to attend, it seems. There are just opportunities to come in and work with people and build up relationships that would allow someone to... who's been in...find themselves in a difficult situation... I know the word I was looking for. It's synergy. There's a certain synergy between the work we do and what Orange Sky does. And it just allows pathways, different pathways for people. That's what... Some people may not like the opportunity to go and sit in an office and interview people. In Orange Sky, you're just sitting down with people having coffee while their washing's being done. So, maybe less confronting for some folk. And certainly very practical, I think. That's what people would really enjoy. Practical help. And what's your hopes and dreams, I guess, for Mackay as a community? And the people of Mackay? What would you like to see happen and grow in this community? I'd like to see that there's a great need for housing and accommodation. And I'd like to think that this community can provide that. Because we are a wealthy community and a generous community. We just need mechanisms and government and other groups within society to all push in the one direction. And be persistent. Because these things don't happen overnight. So I'd like to think Mackay can provide the accommodations. This site that we're sitting at now is going to be turned into six accommodation units. And do our work, some Mr DePaul work, and do the work of Orange Sky, provide Orange Sky another base to work from. That's awesome. I reckon that's it. Unless you have anything else that you would like to say on camera or things that you need to say on camera? I'd just say that St Vincent DePaul is grateful for the opportunity to work with Orange Sky and provide service to people in need. So good. And you do work at the Watch House, yeah? Yeah. Awesome. As I say, on a Sunday we go there and people fight. They might be, they might be in a fight.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Callum William Mason\n\n[00:00:00] My name is Callum William Mason. I was born here in Brisbane, Redland City.\n\nBut my whole life I've been going between Brisbane and North Queensland. Specifically the Atherton Tablelands, which is where my family is. So I spent a bit of time, in between both with the school and both places as well.\n\nIt was pretty hard for a lot of it up until I was about. Maybe 12 years old. So the first bit of my life, we were pretty poor. My mom and my stepdad dad was never on the scene I barely got to see him. Yeah, it was just, it was tricky, but it, things got better after I was 12 years old.\n\n'cause, my mom and my stepdad, they put down their addictions. They also picked up more work and it got easier during, high school.\n\nWhen I was a, when I was a kid, I was a pretty naughty kid. Got into a lot of trouble. I got expelled from my first school, Winham Central State School which is no longer a school anymore, but, yeah, as time go went on, I just, I started becoming like a [00:01:00] better kid because I started realizing if I don't change my ways, I'm gonna, probably end up in prison like some of my family members.\n\nAnd I was getting worried about that. I just really tried to focus on run my role models, my good role models, and during that time where you were struggling, do you have any understanding of like. Why, do you think, was it like a mix of poverty, family, like what you Yeah, just bad influences, friends, poverty stuff of that nature really.\n\nMy mom went to go get me checked for A DD when I was younger. Which turns out to be false. I didn't even have a DDI was just a bad kid, breaking windows, skipping school, jumping the fences at school, just doing anything to get outta school really. Stuff like that. Yeah. What do you think about the current, there's a lot of conversation around youth crime and naughty kids and stuff.\n\nWhat's your perception of why these kids are getting in trouble at the moment? It could be a mixture of a lot of things. It could be culture, could be [00:02:00] music could be video games, like people say. I don't know. I think it's just the environment you're brought up in, to be honest. And yeah, if you get brought up in a bad environment and you have all these other influences of doing the same thing around you, you tend to lean towards that.\n\nI'm with a provider called West Jobs through the Centrelink program. They, their job is to help me look for work, which they they obviously did a good job at because they found me they pointed me in the direction of young guns.\n\nSo I came to this office probably about two or three months ago. Sat down with Latrell in there and, yeah, we just had a yarn seeing if I'd be interested in a position like this. It was a six week course. Yeah. Six weeks. Some of it was, practice, some of it was just having a yarn. Some of it was even doing a forklift ticket.\n\nI passed the forklift ticket and I didn't mind the work. It wasn't too difficult for me, so I just stuck at it and now I'm working there. It's not my first job, [00:03:00] but it is probably my favorite job.\n\nMy favorite job so far, which in terms of the people are lovely. I've met a lot of good friends already. I have a talk with them at work and yeah, I think it's good to be structured and I like the structure of waking up early every morning, having a goal, setting a goal, and end of the day it's for my family, I do it for my family.\n\nThe workers and the people and stuff, mate, some of them are really hard workers. The hardest workers I've ever seen. Really they put in a lot of effort. They look after you, they kara about you. Yeah, it's just a great work environment to be honest.\n\nI wanna stick at this job for at least six months get something on my resume. References, like references and stuff like that want people to, vouch for how good I am at working and how hard I work.\n\nI also wanna get into studying 'cause I'm quite good with it I've always been lean, leaning towards technology since I was 13. Been good with computers ever since then, and self-taught myself some some languages. [00:04:00] Oh C hash. Python JavaScript. I've been learning those over the years since I was 13 yeah.\n\nI hope the program keeps going. I think it helps out a lot of young indigenous people and I have family members that have, come outta prison and it's hard for them to find work, because, they do police checks at a lot of places and they'll judge you from that.\n\nAnd with this program Kean straight up taught us, they're not gonna look at our background. As long as we're willing to work, they're gonna get us some work. I think it would help a lot of people. That's awesome. Yeah. All right, we're gonna take a photo. You ready? Yeah. Do your thing.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\"text\": \" All right brother I just need your name and you could spell it would be awesome too. Yeah my name's George Leon G-E-O-R-G-E L-E-O-N. I'm a Kalkadoon elder, Mount Isa, been in this area since I was born, same as the family. Father moved here in 1947. 1947. Where we're talking now is a house where we've all, there was 12 of us that were born and raised in this yard, plus thousands and thousands of people from all over the communities and footballers, especially a lot of footballers, a lot of footballers that come here to make a day and to play rugby league, they all stayed here. And my father looked after them. You had to go to work, he made us go to school. But a lot of those blokes that lived here, even one of the mayor's son ran away from home to live here, Dennis Petone. His son come here and lived here, he'd rather live with Dad. What I've done, what I do, what I've done in my life is, you know, I've been on both sides of fancy, like everybody. Everybody's not pure. People make mistakes and you can always improve them. You know, if you want to keep making mistakes, you'll get nowhere in life. If you want to improve yourself, you'll improve it. Why? And I think the best way is helping people and that's how I've got a name here. Bai engaged with a lot of people in the community, everyone knows me. Yeah, especially the kids. A lot of the kids, a lot of the parents have taken to me because of the trust of going by everybody. I started as a PLO, I joined the PLO's in 1916 I think it was and I was just about retired and I decided well you know I've got to do something with their life you know I can't keep there's a lot of things to be done still here and a lot of people talked to me about if I could help the community and they knew that I was, you know, I give tough love and that's what I said I'd do when I joined the police, I give tough love and I worked on that. When I joined the police I created a position where I engaged with schools. Now all our crimes and everything, they talk about kids with crime, dealing with crime and their behaviours and that. The only way you're going to find out who these kids are is engage with them when they're young and in school. And it's important, and it was really important to me that we get kids to school. I, all the families, myself, always used to try and talk to kids, get the kids to school. They'd ring me up or they'd tell the kids, Uncle George is coming over, if you're not ready for school, he's going to drag you to school. And now, even now that I've finished, the parents are still saying that. And I said, you can keep saying that because as long as they're going to school, we're getting them to school. But the thing is, I feel there should be more work other than the teachers and principals with other bodies in the schools. Spend a bit more time going in and not just walk around. You've got to walk around it. You've got to look at kids, which kids have the behaviours, and that's what I've done. Look at kids with bad behaviours, but I also never ignore the good kids. So every kid I engage with, I'm saying about four or five hundred kids a week, and like I said, I'm doing that every school. But that's how, it's the only way they're going to stop anything around here. Police have got to go into school, police have got to go and engage with the kids, trying to keep those kids in school, not on the street. If they're out the street, we've got a lot of kids walking down the street right now, in the day, and there's not one person, no agency, no one, doing what I've done by pulling up, talking to these kids and asking why they're not at school. And that's what I used to do. And since I've finished, I've seen more and more out in the street, because they're gaying me because I'm not there. Because they know if they see me in that police car they'd pull up and they'd listen to me. I'd go take them home and talk to the parents. These kids have got to be at school. What's this fella's sort of role in all this stuff? Is he on his way to doing some of the stuff that you might have done maybe? Or are there ways in which this fella is? Look, all the kids know Brodie and that's a big thing. He's only young and he can go a lot further. Look, I'm older and I think a lot of. Like, look, I'm older, I'm older. And I think a lot of those kids, like I said, they needed an older person. A lot of them call me a pop or grandpa, you know, because they haven't got that connection with any families. A lot of them are in care and that's what they need. Someone to trust and be able to say, a lot of kids ask me, they say, what do we call you? I say, you call Pop, you know, it's, but it's by doing that you get their respect. Like I said, Brodie's only young, but the thing is he's building up that and by the time he's another ten years, you know, every kid will know him and get that rapport with him. Whereas I've worked with Brodie, I've seen Brodie at some of the schools, I've seen what he does. I've been to his gym with the kids and he's got kids there that should be targeted. A lot of people are taking kids that aren't being targeted just to get their kids on their books. You know, a lot of people just doing things where the agencies are just filling their books in I just got a drink I just have a drink Do you want me to grab you one? No, it's alright. Do not talk too much There you go, two more to this. You've got to have a big breath to do that. Well, this is what I made out of here, mate. A lot of mob out here with the mangoes make like chutneys and mango chutney. You make that? Mango? Oh, mango ice cream and all that? Yeah, mango ice cream. Yeah, yeah. That, that, that. Some. Yeah, so, look, there's a lot of things that need to be done. The thing is we can't keep saying these poor kids without helping them. A lot of people say, oh these poor kids, you know, but sometimes you've got to say to these kids, no it's not about you, what about these victims? Start thinking about what you're doing to these people, to people that own cars that mightn't have insurance on their cars. Think about the victims. A lot of these kids, yes, you know, a lot of people will say to me, they come from a bad upbringing or something like that. I've seen some of the families and I've been around some of the families where the parents try, but because of all this discipline going out and all that. But it's not about discipline, it's about how you bring your kids up. It's from the start. If you're going to have a kid and we know, especially in this community, all these agencies should know these young girls and young boys having babies, we should be jumping on them straight away, not getting off them until they learn how to bring those kids up. The thing is, people are jumping on them, after a while they just let them go. And now a lot of those kids are just walking around the street with the babies getting babysitted by the grandparents. What's this, like you've been here a long time, have you seen things go up and down with you in Downeyes? Do you think there's reasons for that sort of the waves in what the community's like here? Well I'll tell you when I was young here it was good here. It was a lot better here. Everyone got on. You could sleep outside, you could the doors would be open, everyone you trust anyone. The doors will be open. You trust anyone. It's, you know, we all looked after each other. We had football clubs here. I played in this football club. We looked after each other. If anyone come to town, played up, you'd get chased out. But now there's none of that. Ever since the phones come in and all that, life's changed. And it's changed for the worst, not for the best. What's some of these steps that we take do you think to try and work through this or is there a way to get out of this mess we've got ourselves into? we got us a thing for a while. Look it's it's working together. Everyone working together but people don't do that. It's it's, you've got like I said the people a lot of people who apply for grants and that to run things and that but you've got to know you you gotta you you gotta you gotta get to know the people and everything before you set anything up and know the needs and and how you're gonna run it you this back the country business you know How are you going to run it? This back to country business, you know, you can't just take people out bush for a week or two and expect they're going to change. These kids, a lot of kids will take years to change. I have seen kids change. I know a lot of kids that when I was working with the police, I was dealing with, a lot of them have changed now. They've had enough. But there's another group coming through. And that's the thing. And that's going to just keep going. But like I say, we're not really targeting the main ones. People are targeting kids that are just doing something, but they're not bad. A lot of kids will be naughty, and that's what people target, but they're not targeting the kids that are very naughty. You know, it's, yeah, but you're never ever going to solve it if your boy's sitting on a desk, you know, or computers. People say, oh, they send people to do courses or things on, go down to Brisbane or Melbourne or something, do courses on what? If you, you've got to learn to speak from the heart. And if you speak from the heart and you tell, and you say the right things and you speak the truth, people listen. Like I said, it didn't take me overnight when I was with the police to get to know everyone in this town, but it didn't take me long because I got straight into it. You know, I went straight out there and I tagged the kids first. I went to the kids, to the schools, to the kids, got to know the kids. Every time those kids see me uptown, if they're with their parents, then the parents will know me. And I'm not just talking about Aboriginal kids, I'm talking about every nationality that's in this town. talking about Aboriginal kids, I'm talking about every nationality that's in this town. Look, there's programs, your programs, if you have programs, they've got to, you've got to talk to kids. You just don't do things, you just don't set up something and, you know, crack them out and have a feed. You've also got to sit down and say, talk to them, why? Why are you here? How can we improve? How can you improve? Why are you doing this? Ask them why. No one's asking these kids why they're doing it. We just take them out and... Like I said, I give tough love. I gave tough love and that's what... Every kid in town, the naughty kids, I've got naughty, bad and real terrible kids, those terrible kids, I growled at them. And when I would get locked up with the police and that, I'd growl at them and get right in on them. But then I'd say, you know why I'm saying this? You know why I'm getting up you? It's because I care care I care about your life I'm not here to just tell you off I'm here because I care and that's what you know like I said you I've learned how to speak with kids and speak with people and like like I said, that don't take overnight. But I've been around and when you speak, you've got to, like I said, speak from the heart. Speak what you reckon's right. The programs that Brodie runs, the gyms and like, you know, their thing. Boxing, gyms have always been important, important in the life of everybody. I done boxing one. And that was my most important thing in my life. You learn how to get discipline out there. You learn how, you know, but if you're having these, if you're doing gym, you're telling, you know, this day is here. You don't take that out in the street. If you want to carry on fighting, sign up and we'll put you in a ring, you know. And that's another, you know, I'd like to see a couple of boxing tournaments brought back up, you know. I'd like to see a couple of kids, so they can fight it out in the ring. They could punch each other with the gloves on and, you know, face bars, whatever, you know, sort it out. face bars, whatever, you know, sort it out. And I guarantee you once they've sorted it out after that you shake your hand and it's over. Instead of them going around the streets throwing rocks at each other and stabbing each other, sort it out in the ring. That's how they always used to sort out the problems and they, here, a long time ago there used to be a bullring down in the Iser Hotel and that's where all those old blokes used to go and fight down there. They want to sort out a problem you get on the bullring, they call the bullring and they'd go on there and fight it out and there'd be one-on-one, there's not, you know, everyone into it. The only way, the only way that, back a long time ago, when there used to be big brawls, it'd be because all the mates we'd tackle, everyone at Mount Isa, we'd be looking after Mount Isa people, and bashing people, you know, that come through here to start in trouble. So, yeah, but your gyms are important. I know a lot of blokes with gyms and that, but like I say, you've got to have the right kids in there. You've got to have, not the right kids, the kids you're trying to target, not just any kid. You can have other good kids there that might, sometimes when you've got a couple of good kids in there, the bad kids draw on that and see how, you know, see how, you know, I'd like to be like him or something, you know. Sometimes you do need that good kid there, but also, you know, that's why you run these things. And if you're getting grants and that to target kids, you've got to know which kids. Like I say, there's that many kids around here you can target, but you've got to make sure you get the right ones. And especially around here, you've got a lot of leaders, a lot of kids that lead other kids. That's the kids you grab. You grab them and you start working on them so they can work on these. He's a leader of that group. You know, they've got these gangs. There's always a leader there. And even with the girls, there's always a leader there. I know a lot of girls and there's a few of them that just cause trouble and trouble after trouble. This is probably a tough question, but are there certain people that are more responsible to work on that change than others? Is there, because there's like national, state, local and then agencies. Is it as you said working together better or is it someone coming in and helping to change things? It's working together. Look, we're not as big as Brisbane or Sydney. You know, people know each other, especially if you work in agencies, you know each other. But, you know, everyone's got their own opinion. Some people, you know, want a job just because they have a job, and get money and get paid. That's the big difference. Because you're getting paid to do a job, doesn't mean you don't do nothing, or you try and change something. It's about, you've got a job, you do a job. It's about you've got a job, you do a job. You know, like I said, that police job I had is one of the hardest jobs. You know, I was a boiler maker and worked in the sun and sweated. Now, when I worked as a police officer with the police, that was one of the hardest jobs because you're dealing with the police, that was one of the hardest jobs because you're dealing with the police, the community, everyone. And I put myself there to do that. If I couldn't do that, it would have been a waste of my time. Because I like, if I do something like anyone of you, I got good ethics, I always have. You wanna do a good job, you do a good job. And the money wasn't there with the police. And I was way overworked, but it's, I like what I've done. Any advice for this fella Brodie? Or do you give it to him often anyway? No, I always gave him, I don't know. Look, I think he's on the right track. But he's trying to do it himself too, like I do. And that's the thing. When you're trying to do things by yourself, it's very hard to change. If you've got another four Brodies or four of me or something, it's going to make things a lot easier. But where you find them you'll have people always come up and give you opinions and tell you what you should be doing but they won't do it themselves because they don't know how to approach those situations you know they'll talk about things it's like everything you know the elders are not either one of the things. We've got elders around here. They call themselves elders. But what do they do? A lot of them don't know what to say, the kids. A lot of their kids are doing the wrong thing. But I tell you what, the elders, if you've got a good group of elders that start dealing with these kids, get these kids that start doing, are dealing with the wrong thing, you get them sat, you get these elders sat down, these families and these kids that are doing the wrong thing, front them. Even not just elders, blokes like Brodie, that kids respect. That's the thing, you gotta have that respect. You just can't have an elder there, and these kids, if they don't respect them, they won't listen. You gotta get, like I said, got to get out there. And a lot of these elders, or people that want to be elders, they need to get out there, follow Brodie, go out with him, talk to him, ask him about these kids. Then set up this elders program or something. Get the police to say, right, bring these kids out, all the courts, all these families, these kids that are standing on cars, come and face these, like I said, it doesn't have to be elders, it just needs to be people, outstanding people in the community that can talk to kids and give them advice, but you need not to be too soft. You've got to give that tough love. If you just, you know, oh yeah, we understand. No. No, it's wrong. You've got to say, this is wrong. You can't just say, you know, we know you had a hard life. These kids will play on it. You just tell them, no. This is what you've got to do. If you want to prove your life, you've got to get a group of good people together to stop it. You can stop it, I tell you right now, if you get a ripple. Well, there's that. Amazing. What do you reckon, Brodie? That was almost half an hour, bro. I'm a bit of a chatter, but look, I could sit here for an hour because, like I said, I haven't even covered half what I wanted to cover. Maybe we should do a series every time I come, I can come and do the next chapter. Well, it is, it's bad pay. Look, like I said, all those years I worked with the police, you know, I was on shit money. And everyone else around me making all the money, but I chose because I chose to work with the schools every day and not do afternoon shift and all weekend work. I was stuffed by the weekend because the kids, they tired her down and everyone knew and every principal around here, every school around here, I could just walk in without, I just walk in, I go to any class and I talk to them about behaviours and that. Like I said, there are kids in the school with bad behaviours, but there's no one other than the teachers and the principals dealing with it. Now they're finished for the day. They don't really want to deal with it anymore. They don't want to carry on anything more with it they're not there it's not their kids a lot of those you know we got a lot of white teachers and and that that don't even understand it what goes on and like I said it's up to it's it's the schools that where they got a target you you You've got to target how these kids are growing up. But anyway... Awesome. My wife's ringing me too, so... Thanks for that.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "Everybody else? I always forget. I'll say sorry to Chris here because I forget to clap my hands. It syncs the sound. And I always forget it. So, Chris, I'm sorry. I did it this time. Is that what that thing is for? Is that what that thing is that they use? Well, it records on this. Yeah. And so the sound. Oh, to go to that. To go to that. You have to, like, match it up. And it's semi-easy, but it's better if you've got someone to clap and someone that knows what they're doing. Yeah. Alright, this is a crispy frame. Yeah. Just your name and spell it would be awesome to kick us off. My full name? Yeah, and just look straight at me. So, Danny. D-A-N-E-E. Vanderwall. V-A-N-D-E-R-W-A-L. Right. Tell us a little bit about yourself first. About me? Yeah. And where do you come from and that kind of stuff. And that kind of stuff. I am a local. I actually live very close, quite close enough to this area here. This is my region. This is kind of my hometown area at the moment. I've been in this area for... 20 something years. I've lived up here on the coast. And I've lived in this Wyong area for about 20 years. Yeah, for about 20 years. I am a mother and a wife of two children. I now work in the industry of community services. I did some study a few years ago. I've done a complete career change. So, that's when I joined Orange Sky a fair few years ago. I'm a mental health support. I'm a mental health worker. So, I do that a few days a week. As well as leaving my Tuesdays free so I can work here with Orange Sky. I'm the team leader here of this team. And I'm also... Yeah, I've been volunteering I suppose here for four years. Nearly four years now with Orange Sky. Yeah. What do you love most about Orange Sky? What's great about it? I love my team. But I also love the people here. I mean it's always changing. It's always evolving. But we do have quite a few regulars that attend quite regularly. So I've got quite a good camaraderie and connection with a few of the locals here now. So they bring you back. I always look forward to seeing them every week or every fortnight. And what are you trying to get out of it? What do you take home from shifts and what does it do for you and Orange Sky? I think knowing that there are people out there that do struggle a hell of a lot more. You know. I think that's what opens your eyes to what people are going through. And you know the trials and tribulations of what they go through. And actually appreciating that these people are able to actually open up and willing to open up and connect with you. I love it. I love it. I love that they have that trust to be able to just open up and tell us about it and just to offload and we can be a set of shoulders and ears just for them to be able to unload a lot of their worries and things like that with no judgment. You know. We're just here just to listen and get along with them. And smile. And help them along. That's so cool. I try not to follow questions but sometimes I do. I used to do this all the time and now I don't. So maybe I should. Ah okay. So you're going to get back into it. I just never know when to listen to other people or whether to go where I go. This is an interesting question. Oh god. I might have to break this down myself. What have you learned about the world since you started volunteering? I'm guessing they mean what have you learned about the world since you started volunteering. I think the most important thing is that you're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. You're not alone. What have you learned about the broader, what's a new thing that you have learned about life after you started volunteering in Orange Square? What's something that stood out that you didn't have before you started volunteering in Orange Square? I'd say how hard it is for people to be able to actually ask for help. Sometimes you think people are having troubles and struggles and you just think well why don't they just ask or why don't they just leave? Why don't they change their situation? But it's not that easy. It's easy to say it to somebody but when you're in that situation it's so darn hard for them. So really it's about how hard it really is to be vulnerable and ask for help. That's a huge thing that I've actually, yeah. I'm going to finish these two questions and then I'm going to do my own. What's one word to describe your volunteering experience? One word. In one word. One word. One word. I'm glad they're editing this because I'm going to take a moment to think about one word. About volunteering. I don't know if I could use the word community. Community. Because I'm a part of it and they're around me. So I'd say community. Right. And what would you say to someone who's contemplating volunteering but not quite sure about doing it yet? Come along. Just come along and come and meet the crew. Go and meet wherever you are, wherever you're thinking of going. But especially here. Come along. Spend an hour with us. Come see what we're doing. I reckon that would change your mind, especially when you get to come and see all the team. What do you feel about the general sense of this area and people doing it? What's something that you feel personally, I guess, not so much what other people are saying? I know this is quite a bit of a low socioeconomic area. So I do know that it can be a bit hard around here. There's a lot of services around, but a lot of people are blind to them and they don't know. I'd say not until I was even here. You know, did I know about other services? So, yeah, it's people say, oh, it's a rough. It's got, you know, got a bit of a got a bit of a stigma to it. The area, Waiyong area, because there is a fair bit of housing around here as well. And being that low socioeconomic area and we've had, you know, there's been some serious incidences out here. But to be honest, that's anywhere and everywhere anyway. You know, I know housing in all different suburbs, even in the nice glossy suburbs. They're there too. So. You know, don't pick on the people here. There's my word community. It's a community. So people support each other here. I mean, there's always going to be people that don't get along, but it doesn't matter where you are. People don't get along anywhere and everywhere. Not everybody's meant to be friends. But it's a good community here. People have each other's backs here. And tell us like practically a bit about your role and what you kind of do. What's the shift like? We're busy. Today is very busy. This is one of the busier areas on the coast. I suppose being daytime, you know, especially those that aren't working. So they come and utilise our service. It varies. We can vary from four loads to today, which looks like we could be pushing 10 to 12 loads. So it can be really busy. But our team's fantastic. We've got good support with the neighbourhood centre here. And because they provide here at the service, the service that they provide here, it brings in a lot of people. So it's good to have that. So it's good to have a lot of different characters coming through, you know, getting to know some new people. There's new faces quite often. It's kind of a bit of a rolling area here. So it's constantly evolving with the people that are staying here that live rough here because we do have a fair few people that live rough here. And that's always, as I said, ever evolving too. So but I never feel I never I personally have never felt unsafe. But we also can be vigilant because some people do come in and some people are having a bad day. So you just got to be vigilant. Just keep your wits about you. But we've never really had any serious incidents or anything here. I'm quite comfortable here. I know most of the faces around here. So, you know, I don't I don't feel any any pressure problems, any stress. And I suppose this word friends that I use and band around a lot. What's that word mean to you in the context of Orange Sky? Friends mean to me means connection, making connection with people. So someone that you see, you might see them more regularly. So I suppose that's the way I put it is friends being connected to people. So just to these people that are around in the area and they've got someone that they can come and just talk to. No judgement. Come and have a laugh. Have a serious conversation. You can unload. And we're like a friend and a friendly face. I mean, we're twice as friendly. We're like a friend and a friendly face. What does the connection mean to you? All of us brothers and sisters cleare museums. We're really intoック- ㅎㅎ Some of the Horn efect is shown through their shirts. So I would much triggers workflow and hopefully you can handle that, but you can also build right- decía you can sometimes feel right and maybe feel bad. Yeah, absolutely. So like I yeah, I love all the politics around, like being a little alum that's got that haircut you stuff. You wanna take it out there. Not only is that there's also a lot of unnecessary going on here. from everybody. It's really lovely. You know, we don't come here for that. I don't come here for pats on the back. That's no biggie for me. But they are so lovely and so appreciative of us being here. You know, even if there's times where we're so busy we can't dry their clothes, say, and it's a wash they're happy with. You know what I mean? They're happy to go and take it and put it somewhere and hang it up to dry themselves. But there's always thanks. They're always so thankful. Everyone's so polite and lovely like that and courteous. All right. Boom. Well done. You didn't even stop once.\n",

      "Transcript": "Sounds like you've been doing this for a while though. Oh, I've been hanging around for a long time, yeah. I was the brand manager on Sky about five years ago, I think. Okay. And has your mum been doing it? Was that your connection with it? Oh, no, so I did it first and then I got mum to do it. Yeah, okay. All right, nice. I convinced her. Cole, I think we're pretty rockin' now. So if you just say your full name and spell it so I remember. Okay, so my full name is Nicole Ann Dobson, N-I-C-O-L-E-A-N-N, Dobson, D-O-B-S-O-N. Amazing. Tell us a little bit about yourself. So I've lived in this area for five years now, yeah, five years. Okay. And I moved down from northern New South Wales. I lived in a little place called Brunswick Heads, which is about 20 minutes north of Byron Bay. I know Brunswick very well, yeah. Yeah. I'm from Upper Izzy. Yeah. So I moved up there when I was about 17, grew up in Sydney, had four kids up there and so I've pretty much lived there for my whole life. Wow. What's life like now for you? It's great, great. I've just recently though had to move. I was living in a lovely sort of duplex kind of house in Swansea Heads with great views and it was just like an absolute wonderful find of a house and that sold suddenly with the buyer stipulating vacancy. So I got 30 days notice and it pretty much took me all that time just to pack up and sell things and all of that. And so I actually don't have a home at the moment. I'm still looking. I'm staying with friends. I'm very fortunate to have kind friends and yeah, but rents have gone up. So I couldn't possibly afford to replace where I've been to get what I need. I need to pay at least $100 more than I had been. So it gives you a good indication of how tough it must be for families and so I'm just one person. But people with kids, there's a lot of homeless people in this area. A lot of families living in cars I've discovered since this has happened. Yeah. What's your sense of the community I guess in terms of what you're saying there, like the struggles? Like do you see it often? So no, no. You see the odd person. I sort of work occasionally with my church. I work with my family. My church does a second bite program on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I sometimes go down on a Wednesday and just sit and talk to people. And so there are, you know, we get the occasional people who come through who are, you know, like in an emergency situation. But most of the people who live in their cars are living there by choice. And that's how they kind of feel they can cope best. But it wasn't until I was in this situation and actually looking on, you know, private rental sites and different groups on Facebook that I realised how many people were desperate for houses and, you know, have been months, some even years. Without getting accepted. So like people like, so for example, there was a family that they'd migrated here. So the wife had specialised nursing skills. So they were brought in. She's working full time. But he can't find work yet. I'm not sure what country they came from. And they've got kids and they're all living in their car. They can't get a house because they haven't got references. They haven't got an Australian rental history. And I don't understand why they're not being sponsored. Because they should, I mean, ordinarily, you know, if a business brings in someone from another country to fulfil a specialised role, they sponsor them. They go to the real estate and say, you know, we'll go guarantor for them if anything goes wrong. Or, you know, they'll pay a bond or something like that. I don't understand why we can't have that system in place for people like, Department of Housing does that sort of thing for people who are struggling. But. I think immigrants aren't entitled to that sort of help. You have to be a resident. How did you first hear about this Orange Sky stuff? So I think I'd just come down to the library and I'd seen you guys and I'd just asked what was happening. And so, yeah, I've only used the service a couple of times, but it's been brilliant because, we have a laundromat apparently, which I only just discovered, but it's changed hands now. But before the guy was never there. So it was pretty much we didn't have one. So, you know, if you, you know, if your machine broke down, you'd have to drive into Cooks Hill and cost you 40 bucks. So. Yeah, tell me more about that. You were just talking about that. What was it? Yeah. So, so a couple of weeks ago, because I'm, you know, now without home, I went in to do my washing in there and I was blown out at how expensive it was. So $10 a load. And that was for the smallest machine. And so I did three loads of washing and, and one load of drying and $10 for the drying. So 40 bucks. And then she wanted to change. Yeah. And then when you weigh up the priorities that some people might have, maybe that sits a bit lower than everything else, right? Yeah. Well, so, so if, I mean, Orange Sky is brilliant because if you don't have your own washing machine or if you're in a situation where you're homeless or living in your car or whatever, this is a free service. So. And I love that there's no questions asked. They don't, there's no discrimination. So if you don't look homeless, you're not, you know, shunned or anything. In fact, you know, they're just beautiful people that welcome you and sit down and have a chat with you. And it's, it's lovely. It's great. And I think people really need that. They need that. They need that kindness and, you know, a smile, a bit of love goes such a long way. So true. I think it's like, yeah, the epitome of the philosophy of what they try to achieve is no judgment, understanding, and just an openness to people's, like, needs and whatever. And I think that the stereotypical person who's homeless is not necessarily, like, the only reason why. It exists. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And what's it like, what's it feel like, I guess, like this, this happens across Australia, like hundreds of times a day, a week or whatever. What do you think the impact is more like generally in terms of like, of all the things, from the watching, the conversation, the connection? What do you think the impact is on Australia, like to be able to have a service like this? I don't know that you can measure that. I think you can't measure kindness. I mean, it can have a profound effect on a person's day. To have a small bit of kindness in the morning can mean that someone can have a wonderful day because it, you know, when we smile at one another with genuine warmth and care, it's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing. And if we have that kind of warmth and care, then that's something that, you know, it bypasses all our understanding. It tells us that we're worth something, you know, which is, you know, people have negative voices and expectations in their heads and all around them. And so it's priceless. That's awesome. And like, what do you think about the idea that it's priceless? Yeah. I mean, I think it's a great idea that it's run by just volunteers. I guess it's all models where you could pay people to do it and there's different ways to commercialise it. Yeah. What's the value of it being a volunteer-led type experience? I think it just keeps it very down to earth. Then it's very people-oriented. If it's a job, it tends to change everything, doesn't it? It becomes about money and about outcomes and about, you know, reaching yourself. Reaching your CPIs and all of that jazz. It's just when it's volunteers, we're all in it together kind of thing. It's volunteers tend to volunteer because they want to. So even if, you know, if it's a work for the doll situation, they choose where they want to go and the people they want to volunteer with. Yeah. And volunteer organisations, hopefully all of them, I mean, I don't know if all do, but treat them well. Like these guys are all really happy. They're great, you know, which is what you want, isn't it? You know, and yeah, anyway. That's so cool. So wicked. It was amazing. Like your view on everything is awesome. Thanks, Ben. You have a really good understanding of why this is here. So it's cool. Anything else you wanted to say or like anything we didn't talk about that you thought was important? I don't. I think that's fine. Wow. That was great. Thank you so much. I'm just going to take a photo, if that's all right. Mm-hmm. Bye.\n",

When you coming from the,\n\nyou see him when you come in from the airport. Tell me about him.\n\nI'll tell you about my mum pants. Yeah. Oh, sorry about this. It's all right. Take your time.\n\nYou take a photo of him? Yep. Yeah. I took two photos of him in the mirror, had all the photos that picked him.\n\nAh, so good. Oh, I went across. There we go. [00:01:00] Cool.\n\nWhere do I start? Start with your name. So if you can say your full name and then spell it, that would be the best place to start.\n\nOkay. You on? Yeah. Yeah. Hi everyone. My name is Iris. I'm a for foot. My parents were born here, Norman America for Foot. Eh, dad is from Bowan, the BI area, and. And mom. My grandmother, Audrey, she was from ow. My dad her father was from Maribo, Chileo area. They were moved to Palm and my mom met my dad in 19, 19 35.\n\nI think they would've met up together and. [00:02:00] 39. Oh, sorry. My mom and dad my mom was born in 1939. They were sent she was born here. This is where she was she went with different family, like families rna, the Maca boy family, she had a lot of friends, my mom, but she was put in the dormitory because her mom had other children.\n\nBut the real memory I've got of my parents together, they had, they got married and a IM church and in 19 1959. 1960. Of course, I came along. Then my sister Ivy, Diane, and Norman. We lived in an area called bottom end. Then we were moved up into another area to stick with the tribes.\n\nI believe my grandfather's wife was from out west, a Ative [00:03:00] lady. Yeah. And anyway we moved back down to the other end of the island. My mom and dad had no way of feeding us, my father to find ways to, to feed my sister, myself, my sisters, and myself. So they. I love the story about them.\n\nMy dad built a boat and the little boat was named Ivy May, after my other two sisters, Ivy and Diane May, and they, he, I dunno where he got the wood from, but he managed to scrap all the wood up to just to make this little boat and made the paddles. He made a wamp and he had spears and they rode to. To Possum Island.\n\nThey did it like monthly, every month. She would hunt for turtle at night and they'd sleep [00:04:00] over there and catch the tide coming back. And we'd all wait on the beach getting happy 'cause we had food, turtle and fish and possum, whatever they can gather over there. We came, yeah, they came home with the tail.\n\nThey'll cut it up in front of, on the beach in front of other families and they'd share it. My dad would share it or sell aate for a dollar, $5. But he was a good cook. He knew how to cook a rice, cook it down. But there were main important things that they, that we had to eat fish. Rice was filling and the damper was filling.\n\nThere was no bread back then. And he made spears. But one year it was one we went, we moved back up to the other end of the island. 'cause we had a, we went into our new home and we had to go away for school, but then the canteen was open and. [00:05:00] My mom and dad was drinking. They fell in a trap where, and us kids used to ran, run away with our grandmother.\n\nAudrey I, one the fondest memory, and I always think about it, how did they get to, to make a boat and to make those paddle and the, the tools to catch our food, the food, the turtle, and the fish and row and the exercise my mom had to row too as well. She's only a small woman and when they bought the food back, it fed us and we was happy and content with it.\n\nWith that. Until the canteen was open, I spoke about the canteen. They fell in that trap and we were, my mom and dad really wanted us to go to school, so they'd sent us out to a place in South Townsville. It was called a around [00:06:00] house. I went there, I enjoyed it, but my education level was so low that the sisters there put me back to grade six.\n\nGrade seven to catch up. I stayed there and done grade 12 and Mar 10 and Margaret Mary. I was happy with that. My other two sisters dropped out. They did come out but caused the low level of education that we had. They couldn't go further. I got that extra support but I never thought much of it.\n\nIt was education and I stayed doing my own thing for two years. Then I had my children,\n\nbut\n\nI felt that it was a relationship where I had the kids without the father. Anyway, I went on to. To working at the school 'cause I had lower self-esteem and I was invited to go to the school, do some reading [00:07:00] with the kids, which helped me with my level of reading so I could start from there up and learn more.\n\nI stayed there for five years, I think, and teacher aid that promoted me to teacher aid and I loved that job. It was, help discipline the kid and remind them that education is really important. Then my partner then we had been going to church. I thought, oh, we gotta do it right by God and get married.\n\nSo we did, but he died of cancer, so it left me as a widow with the kids. I moved from the school 'cause I couldn't, I just moved and went to the women's shelter. I helped women who were struggling with domestic family violence and single women who were struggling in their lives. I stayed there for six years.\n\nI had time to, [00:08:00] then it closed 'cause by then. \n\n\n\\## Transition and New Beginnings\n\nNew organization came in and took control of it. So I was left out for a couple of years. I didn't work. \n\n\n\\## Meeting My Partner and Career Shift\n\nI met my now partner. We, there was a job going at the rehab, so we took that advantage and he drove the bus and became a case worker here.\n\n\n\\## Current Role and Reflections\n\nAt thirties and knowing that alcohol and drug affecting our kids, I stayed in December. I've celebrated my 13 years here, which I'm really happy I did. With the take of the new company now, I feel it's still important to stay open in regards to drug and alcohol and other drugs as well. My age now is 65, probably 65 this year.\n\nI think I done my share in this community. I find my children are all [00:09:00] respectful. There's one of them that's in and outta jail, but he'll come around. And my daughters, I've always reminded them, don't rob your children of schooling. Make sure you send 'em to school every day. Education is important and their health and wellbeing is too.\n\nMy mom, we're waiting to move into our new home now at bottom end, and all she wants to do is go out camping just to laying on the beach and fishing. So I'm looking forward to that. We've leased some land at the other end of the island and we are gonna we're currently. And I ask someone to build these camps up and it'll be my camp, my children camp.\n\nAnd they're gonna learn the skills of living out there in the bush, living off the land. Back then we only had that one boat. We walked, so walked right down there. It was fun. We was in our team on matter back then. [00:10:00] Now. It's, you gotta get a boat here and a boat there, and boat everywhere. But I'm in no condition to walk either my mom yeah.\n\nI'm currently now stationed at thirties. I love it here. I love being around the people. I know our, we got one aim and goal is to help our people who are struggling. With alcohol, drug and other issues wellbeing. Yeah. And thank you. Amazing. Thank you for listening. Can you tell me about your lineage, your family you were talking about before?\n\nHow does, what's order, does that go in your family? My mom, she lost a son and was traumatized by it. And then. I come along in the sixties and I think I was a little perfect kid then to my parents. Then there's another my sister come along, Ivy and my other sister Diane. [00:11:00] And then my brother and my other sister.\n\nSo I'm the eldest of my, my family, my entire family, my mom's family the Alice in our clan group. I feel mom will respect me. It goes to a, I have to respect them too and understand them too like they do respect me. But. Yeah, that's me. What's where I stand in my family. And how many kids and grandkids do you have?\n\nI have seven, seven children. Pretty sure it's 2023. 23. 23 grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Yeah. It's good to remember those. Yeah. Do you remember all their names? No. We had a, we, when we went [00:12:00] to top end of Liv, we was like, I was kissing my mom. We need to have a Christmas dinner or Christmas breakfast.\n\nMom might be here next year. Then we have another one, then another one. But we're going back in our home and we'll probably have another one. A nice gathering together. Yeah. Yeah. What is it that about Palm Island that's special for you? Is it just because you are connected here or is it something about the place now or special because it's home, it's nowhere.\n\nThere's no place like home. Sometime I wish I could travel. But that's not me. It's a\n\nI would've traveled when I was in my thirties, forties, but no special Parmesan. And I don't think I ever lived. Yeah, I might for you a few weeks, but. Yeah. What do you think about the future of Palm Island? Are you confident in that it's gonna have a good future or are you worried where's [00:13:00] your head up with that?\n\nWith the future? I believe today's generation, we have to educate the kids. We have to make sure they go to school. We need to make sure they're in a safe environment away from the alcohol and drug away from abuse. So they can learn when they're at school. Yeah, it's important that it's important that the kids go to school, even my children and their children make sure they go to school and have a safe environment at home that they can come out to.\n\nYeah. What do you think your mom would say about the future of Palm Island and the current stuff? Does she ever talk about what she thinks about the future? Oh, I didn't do that when I was young. I done this. I had to do that, and yeah. Yeah, she'll compare sometimes. Yeah. Especially with in regards to alcohol and drugs.\n\nAnd how does it work with getting a lease on Palm Island and doing that stuff? Is that simple or is that hard? Oh, we went and got, you allowed to go and fill a paper up at the council office [00:14:00] and say, you want this piece? And they put up on the billboard and people don't, if people dispute our they'll say so.\n\nBut nothing's been said with the place I'm leasing at the moment. And is it a transaction with money? Is that how it works? Yes. I have to, once I get the camp up, I'll do that and hopefully they'll keep a record of what's been done so my children can pay that amount to keep up the lease. Yeah.\n\nWhat sort of a sort of place do you think you will build there? What sort of just a camp. I think we can have a camp at that area, but that if the lease is there say another 20 years. When they do fix the road up where we're going that spot is just beautiful. The lease is there will whether my kids or grandchildren are obligated to, and the lease, they, I know I'm open, but I gotta go and talk to em, empower the myself and in regards to land.\n\nYeah. What sort of [00:15:00] structures do you think you'll building? Will you build them or other people or? I had in mind, I've already got the kitchen up sort of thing. And three little rooms, a camping area and a veranda and a place where you can, and you can put your tents near the fireplace and we're looking out to certain areas and we'll have a better history of the certain areas.\n\nI'm hoping schools will go and use it. 'cause it's nice, it's dangerous. There's current there, but my kids know not to go to a certain area where it's, yeah. They only used it a couple of times, so once it's billed, maybe we can use it. And how do you get there, there now? Do you need I've got a boat and I've got a couple boats I found, we've gotta transport behind timber and whatnot. Needed there? Yeah. I'm looking how far is on the boat from the port? It's [00:16:00] right down the end of that island. Oh, okay. Right down there. At the end of the point, my family, my mom's family lived there. Oh, awesome. And yeah, they lived there for some times.\n\nTheir uncles and their mom used to go to then camp as well, yeah, A better history and the family that's there using it, they know my mom. See. And the history of the place itself. How many people do you think have leases and camps in different parts? I don't know. I've seen a lot on the billboard.\n\nThey even there's family that leased on in Possum Island. I think the family here at least. The other island. That island across the family. Yeah. Yeah. And what's it like when you go there? What do, what's the activities? Is it a lot of what do you do when you go there? Where do I go? Where, when you go to your Lees, where, what do you do?\n\nThe kids, we line them up all on the beach and they just play all day. But they're all row now. I'm trying to get that fo [00:17:00] where they're all laying on the beach to show 'em and put it up in the camp. This is here. This is a you here and some sense of ownership around that little area that we've leased.\n\nYeah. I was talking to Uncle Alan. He wants to put a camp over the young kids. I think it's over this way that he might have access to Northeast Bay. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And what's have you got any hopes and dreams for what this birdies can become in the future? Are you hoping other people can come stay here in the future, or?\n\nI hope they turn it into a residential area where you see it for a few years and we'll still operate care for run programs for people who what you call it, in that boundary. We got problem with alcohol and drugs and they're all here. Our people are here who are struggling to break that chain, that bonded that's there.\n\nAnd no way I [00:18:00] known how to get help from, for it. I believe this was the elder's dream to help people who struggle with Yeah. With alcohol and drugs. To become a better person. Now there's more out there, but we're gonna understand that transgenerational trauma. Yeah. And this generation of changes has changed so much.\n\nPalm Island. And then people wanna, if you need to recover, you wanna get help, you need to get help for yourself. Yeah. You were saying a about the church before. Do you go to church? That is that Yeah. My mom and I went to church up there, a IM church and my mom shared with the group from Melbourne.\n\nShe said to them, I got married in that church over here. Yep. Yes, she got married in the church and uncle Frank. Was in the same classes there, so there's hardly any elder [00:19:00] elders left. Uncle Frank lives near Uncle Allen down there. Yeah. Yeah. We were supposed to go back to church 'cause little sentiment value we looked at in the knowledge center there was this photo we looked at.\n\nYeah. My mom was in that photo they had gathering in the yard. And outage in the yard and other thing, pray, praise and worship in the yard. So I think is sentiment of values to the church, not just for the marriage, but we were regular. Church goes back then, we had no choice in our grandfather. Always went to church.\n\nYeah. Do you, what do you think about the history of Palm Island in terms of. Do you think about some of the negative stuff that happened in the history as well, or do you try not to think about it too much? During my time and learning about it and in a lot of training that we went through the kids gotta understand what the elders that went through that, [00:20:00] what they went through, and I think finding their history and where they come from.\n\nWould help. Or even if you know your own tribe, you know your own family. I think that laia too, to have a sense of who am I? Who am I? Where did I come, where did my grandparents come from?\n\nAnything we didn't get to talk about that you? 'cause I think one thing we'll I'd love to do is work out, I think I'm gonna come back on the 2nd of June in two weeks. And I'd love to find out who in your family would like to have a conversation that could connect up with your conversation.\n\nThink your mom and happy use. Yeah, my mom, she'd be happy to sit down with you. She's she's been through a lot and we can do it super simple and in a real complic way. Yeah, you can, we can [00:21:00] go home. We help home and sit down and yarn, take the boat out to the lease.\n\nYeah. Yeah, my mom. All right. I think she'll like to sit with you. Yeah. If I'm present there and my partner. Yeah. And what's your partner's name? Sorry? Clay. Clay. Clay. And how long you been with Clay? Oh, it's been a while now. 2010. So we turned 50 together and we turned 60 together and we're probably, we're turning 25 65 together.\n\nThat's great. Yeah. That's awesome. Cole, I'm just gonna take a couple of photos. Oh, I'm not gonna be a model now.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Margot and Grahame\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nClap my hands pretty good. Okay, so we're gonna do a little one, two. So your first, or your full name and spell it out for me would be great. Margot, M-A-R-G-O-T, surname Scales, S-C-A-L-E-S. Amazing. And Graham, G-R-A-H-A-M-E Williams. W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S. So good. Graham, why don't you kick us off with how do you usually introduce yourself?\n\nWe'll talk about yourself for who are you at the start point? Wow. Okay. So I retired quite some years ago after a semi-retirement phrase phase. Decided I wanted to do some volunteer work and I saw the advertisement for Orange Sky. I thought, yeah, that sounds exactly what would suit me. And that was four and a [00:01:00] half years ago, and Margo and I went, arrived at about the same time, and it's a very tight unit.\n\nOur group on a Monday morning shift is a very close knit group. And we like it here. We haven't, I've not done, oh yes, I've done a couple of shifts at other locations, but this is our regular Monday morning gig. And the people are always interesting here. Most of them are in some stage of transition.\n\nSometimes they come here directly from jail because on, or they need an address, and this is often the case. Others come here with a variety of drug and alcohol problems. Some of them move on when they recover and are ready to move on. But many of them stay for very many years. Long time. Yeah.\n\nCool. Good start. Margo, what's about yourself? I didn't retire as early as Graham. I retired at 75. [00:02:00] And prior to retiring. I thought I, I wasn't ready to sit at home and I had watched the orange sky start and get established and had followed it, and I thought, I need to put something in place for when I retire and when did the training found that the Monday shift would be the most suitable for me because I worked at Parliament Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursdays.\n\nSo that's how it started and I got lumped with those three guys and nothing will separate the four of us now. It's a wonderful group. Yeah. And if I can just interrupt and say that she's in fact the problem child in the shift, I'll be right. No. We're a tight group. We go out to lunch once a month and today's lunch day.\n\n[00:03:00] And enjoy the people that are here. And yeah, so that's my lot. Awesome. What's what does Orange Sky mean to you as a central idea or impact? Is it more one thing than the other or is it many things or is it something very simple? What's, what is orange sky to you? Wow. I think orange sky's the many faceted.\n\nThing. It's more than an entity. It is an entity, but it's, it has a lot of benefits for the people, the friends who come. But it's also, it can be and is for us very enjoyable in the process of assisting people doing their washing and drying, but also assisting them sometimes in a little bit of.\n\nJust listening to them. Yeah. And a bit of humor and yeah, a bit of humor, which they probably don't get sitting in their rooms. Yeah. Yeah. It's an outside [00:04:00] reliable contact for the people here who regularly do their washing. I think the regulars who wash do genuinely enjoy seeing us. Definitely are pleased to see us enjoy being with us and.\n\nYeah. Yeah. What about Hobart as a whole in terms of an orange Sky's place in the city? Do you think it has a place and people know it, or what's it's very interesting when I tell people who don't know that I do volunteer work of any kind, they say, what do you do? And I say, oh, I work for Orange Sky.\n\nAnd they blank over. Yeah. That's inevitable with, so the name doesn't have easy recognition here, but as soon as you say we're in a van and we have two washers, and Oh yeah, I've heard about them. Yeah. So they know the concept. They know that we are here. Not the brand name. Just not the Yeah. The name itself is not easily identifiable in the community.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's sad. It's so interesting. It's very [00:05:00] common. Across Australia though. Yeah, it is. Which I find is strange. Yeah. Because I, I got to know them first as orange sky, not as the van with the washers and dryers. Yeah. If you think about all the charities around Australia it's really hard to Oh, yeah.\n\nAlmost pinpoint to them, right? Yeah. People know Salvation Army and, but I think there's 60,000 charities in Australia. Wow. It's quite a, it's quite a mam of thing. It's interesting that I heard a stat the other day that orange sky now has the second highest touch point of people experiencing homelessness in Australia.\n\nSo the actual the amount of people using the service is in comparison to other homelessness charities very big. Yeah, I, that could be, because it is conducted on a. A laid back basis. Whereas if you went to an organization [00:06:00] that deals with homeless you're confronted with rules, regulations.\n\nWhereas here it's a bit more formal with say, yeah, salvation Army. Yeah. If you are getting housing from 'em. This is, as s Margo said, it's a lot more laid back. Yeah. It's very casual. You just, clothes washing and drying. It's, they're more comfortable with it. Yeah. It doesn't require anything on their part of No.\n\nApart from a bit of chitchat and some, yeah. Banter and that's about it. And as we were saying before, because we're on premises for the people who live here, they. Often don't tend as a group. They don't come and chat for long periods and then go, because they drop it, they go back to their room and then they come and pick it up after it's dried sort of thing.\n\nBut we do get people stopping in for a chat. We've got a regular half a dozen or so that will sit the whole shift. Some of them don't even wash. They might come down on [00:07:00] Thursday and wash. When we are here on a Monday as well. Yeah. And they'll just come and sit and chat. And there are others that have been through, got their own place made, Adrian in particular.\n\nYeah. Come back. They come back and see us. And particularly when it's school holidays, when he's got his children, he loves bringing his kids back to, to talk to us so yeah. There's a bit of repeat business. Yeah. Not so much business, but repeat. Friends who've been here have left and don't come back to do their washing, but they come back to see us and chat with us.\n\nAnd that's always really nice, isn't it? Oh yeah. We like that a lot. Yeah. Yeah. It shows that we're, they're still mindful of us as people, even though they don't necessarily associate us with orange sky. There's some really tough customers here with extremely tough backgrounds. But they're genuinely pleased to see us.\n\nYeah. [00:08:00] And in fact, we are pleased to see them. Really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In all the years, probably only had two occasions when I've felt just a tad vulnerable, and then I've looked around at who was there, and a couple of the friends that live here. I thought, I'll go and stand near you because you'll look after me.\n\nAnd they would, yeah. That's awesome. What, do you have any sort of thoughts ever on what you hope Orange Sky is in say, 10 or 20 years? Is there this idea that will be awesome for them to be international and massive and huge? Or do you think it's much better to stay small enough to stay.\n\nLike connected and close to volunteers and friends. From a Tasmania perspective, I don't know that can get much bigger if we've only got one van. It is my understanding the van's out seven days a week and sometimes twice a day. So from a [00:09:00] Tasmania perspective, unless there's another man, it can't get any bigger.\n\nBut I find it very encouraging that they're now in New Zealand and. They must help an awful lot of people. I suppose the only way it could expand in Tasmania is if we had a second and or third van in the north and northwest of the state. Yeah, because this one just covers the Hobart area, whereas it's only half the state's population that are here.\n\nThe other half are in the north of the state, and I'm sure the same. People, the same friends that we have here would be replicated, yeah. In similar dimensions in the north of the state. That could be an expansion idea for here, but back to your question about do, how do I see it huge and international?\n\nIt's possible. I don't want it to get too big. I'm not sure that I would want that. I like it as a national, although it is in New Zealand. Am I right? Yeah. [00:10:00] Yeah. No, I think I like it as it is. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Well done.\n\n",

Amazing. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about, uh, yourself and your role, um, here. Okay. So here I'm the operations coordinator. So I'm responsible for the van and for the employees of the van. So the employees of the van are people who come from vulnerable backgrounds.\n\nUh, so I mean. In charge of helping them reintegrate and helping them with their, their everyday tasks. Uh, I'm also in charge of the multipurpose center for the homeless, and we have their five washing machines, a five drying machine, so I'm in charge for the smooth operation of the center. Amazing. Um, what draws you to this type of work?\n\nLike why do you do this work? So, uh, I studied international relations and also had a minor in psychology. And I decided that I really wanted to do something that has to do with people. And because [00:01:00] here in Greece we have so many, uh, homeless people that they don't have any services. I thought that this initiative was amazing and I was really excited of participating.\n\nSo I had my internship here, uh, and now I, I work here. Amazing. Um, tell us a little bit about what it's like on shift here. Like what, what does happened just then, this experience? Yeah. Uh, so here people come, they know the, the spot because of word of mouth. They, we've been here operating for many years, so people know it.\n\nSo they come and they bring the bags with the clothes, uh, and we put numbers on each bag so that we know for which person is. Uh, wet bag, and then we put them on the washing machines. We wash them right on the spot and then on the drying machines, and we dry them, and then we give them, we give them back.\n\nOf course, there, there are some problems, uh, during the sift of course, because there are people who, who really want to wash. But if we have, for example, 25 people, then we won't be able to. [00:02:00] To help more people. So sometimes there is a bit of tension, but, but it's going well. What's the interaction like with people who use the van?\n\nUm, it's really nice. Um, as I've told you, of course there are people who with many different backgrounds and they come here and sometimes they, they may have tensions between them and they don't get in fights, but. They, they have tension. So we have to be very careful on keeping, uh, the same rules every day, uh, in terms with the line and who's gonna take priority or not.\n\nOf course it's difficult, but with just empathy and understanding, I think it's What bit of conversations happen around the van do you think? Ah, it depends. Every day. Some people just come and talk about their days. Of course. Uh, we also have a social worker here who, who helps them. Today's is not here, but we have Tuesdays and [00:03:00] Thursdays, the social worker, the conversations, um, as I can recall today, for example, uh, a gentleman came and he just started saying that he's going to the beach today because it's a really sunny day.\n\nSo you see like every type of of conversations and of course, that it's a really important service that we have here. Uh, and we get a lot of thank you every day. Amazing. So there's, uh, some people here from different parts of the world today. Yeah. We're talking about this thing of a what this idea of a global type mm-hmm.\n\nAlliance of people coming together looks like. What's your, what's your take on what that is and the opportunity? Yeah. I think that a lot of people forget that hygiene and clean clothes are very important for, for people because we also, we always. Talk about other services that they should have access to.\n\nBut we always forget that clean clothes is the, the first step for reintegrating into society. Because if they don't have clean clothes, of course they're not gonna get interviews. For example, [00:04:00] they, they won't be able to operate in everyday lives. So I think that it's. Important to raise awareness on how important it is to, to have, uh, clean clothes, to, to, to be hygienic in order to, to have dignity in general in your, your life.\n\nAnd what difference do you think having, um, a group of people from all around the world talking about this around Just one, I think, yeah. The important thing is to, to raise awareness globally because yes, we do it here. Uh, we were the first, uh. Laundry unit in Europe. Uh, and we understand from that that this is not very well known and it's not something that people think about.\n\nSo if there's a huge group of people worldwide, I think it's gonna raise more awareness, advocacy, and then. Hopefully more initiatives like that, uh, will be in the world. Cool. And have you, um, learned much about the other groups yet here, or is today that, that you're, uh, yes. I think today, uh, I wanna [00:05:00] meet you all and listen to, to what you do.\n\nUh, I have a glimpse of that, but I just wanna meet you today and talk about it. Amazing. Uh, is there anything else you wanted to say we missed or something important topic that I, uh, no, just like, uh, I'm really excited about today. I. Think it's, uh, it's very important because you see, we, we have this here and it's, uh, it's a small community of people.\n\nOf course, we cannot help as many people as we wish to. Uh, so I think that it's, it's, it's very, very important and I'm really glad that you guys are here. Amazing. Well done. Well spoken.\n\n\n",

      "Transcript": "My grandmother used to pick me up from school every single day and I lived in that house. So it's one of those times where you, where you like, it was probably a very reflective few days I think. It'd be nice though, if I can come down and help. Alright, so this is, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, super helpful. So this can go behind your shirt and then this clips on and that holds it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you put it like high-ish but like still hidden if that makes sense. Oh yeah. Okay. Great. Oh, that's perfect. I think we're ready. Okay. So you just look at me. Yep. Don't worry about the cameras. Cool. So just your name and spell it just so we can have it with all of you. Spell it? Okay. So my, just first name? Yeah. My name's Leslie, L-E-S-L-E-Y. Oh, maybe your last name too. Laylor, L-A-L-O-R. Cool. What's the Leslie story? Tell me. Tell us a little bit about yourself. Oh, right. The Leslie story. Well, fortunately, my mother didn't call me what my grandmother wanted to call me because I was born on Christmas Day. So they wanted Carol or Noel or something like that. So mum chose to name me after her cousin who went down in a plane during the war, who was a male, but changed the spelling to the female. Wow. That's exciting. Yeah. And tell me, yeah, tell us a little bit about like what got you here, I guess. Okay. So I had reached a stage where I had finished work. My... One time away from the plane. Okay. We waved to it? We haven't got too many planes here, is there? No. That's unusual, actually. And that's a light one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We get big ones go over because the raft base is up at Williamstown. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and my children were adults. My grandchildren had reached the stage. They didn't really want to spend holidays. They didn't want to spend holidays with Gran anymore. And I stumbled across Orange Sky in the news in the Newcastle Herald quite some years ago. And I thought, hmm, this might suit me. So, yeah, I went to... I was face-to-face onboarding back then. And yeah, joined. And that's where I've been ever since. What was the first bits of volunteering like? I went from... I'd drive the van up to Port Stephens, up to Nelson Bay on a Monday night. And I'd go to the airport. And I'd go to the airport. And I'd go to the airport. And I'd go to the airport. And then once COVID hit, of course, we all shut down. And then I got a bit... And then I got a bit... After COVID, I got more involved. I was down at the Swansea shift. Bit by bit, things happened. People resigned. And yeah, now I'm a team leader here. Actually, I started this shift. I was team leader when this shift first started. And things happened and people weren't doing what they were doing. And I took on service coordination. And I took on service coordination. And I took on service coordination. And I took on service coordination. And I took on service coordination. And I took on service coordination. Amazing. Tell us where we are and what the shift is like. Oh, here in Hamilton South, we're in a social housing area here at the community hall. we're in a social housing area here at the community hall. It's... what I would call a fractured society. It's a little bit... there's lots of issues in here, but there's lots of beautiful people as well. Our service provider is Catholic Care. They do a lunchtime barbecue, which if you could put the sense of smell in with this, you would be able to smell the bacon and the sausages cooking, which makes everybody, mmm, very nice. Yeah, so they do that, so we're here when they're here. And, yeah, our friends here are... Most of them are here waiting for us before we get here. We've become... I think we've become a real integral part of this... ..the fabric of this society. They look forward to us coming and there's Bob just going. Do you mind if I say bye to him? See you, Bob. See you, bye. See you next week. Thanks, Bob. Good for hanging out, mate. Will that be online or not? I will send some information so you can see what happens to it. How's that? OK, good on you, mate. Thanks, mate. See you next week. Take care. Yeah, so, yeah, that's about what happens here. And, yeah. There's two friends that I talked with before in the interview. Mm-hm. Julie and Bob. And Bob, yeah. Tell us a little bit about, like, what that feels like for you, their relationship and their time here. It's... It's really interesting. Like, they... Julie, in particular, loves us being here. It gets her out of her little one-room, confined apartment. She... When we first started here, she had issues with her hip. She had broken her hip. So it was... Her social... It was... JIM Officer Yeah, and she's lived in Australia for, like, in the last five, ten years.opolitically, she... We've had issues for four, five years, in Sachenia, Canberra in New Africa, and DB Update. We've had... We've had problems. We have aícula. We really have. Several... As... As a family Come to speak to the people who live here in the asking-of-acks, they can't happen without us. Soil all that. So there are only so many of them at the beginning of our journey, after volunteering for this now? With Orange Sky? Well, I quite often tell people this little story. I used to not communicate very well with homeless people. I would feel embarrassed about them and I would sort of kind of walk past. But now, after talking to them, particularly one guy that was on shift, he said he can normally always get a meal, he can normally always get a shower with the services that are around and about. The thing he struggled with most is the sense of social isolation, that people wouldn't talk to him. So now I'm up front, I go straight up to them. If I see anybody sitting outside the shops or on the street somewhere, I will either ask them what they would like to eat if I'm going into a shop and buy them something to eat, I still hesitate to give them money, but I will buy them something or I will stop and even sit down beside them and have a yak and they are always grateful for that. And I think, for me, that was an eye-opener that they're no different to me in reality. And this is not a one-way street. There's a lot. You've seen the rapport that's here between the volunteers and the friends. And so... Yeah, it gives me a sense of purpose as well, I guess. So cool. What do you think that the community can learn, I guess, more that helps them to, as you do, interact with people experiencing homelessness better and also, like, what can people do like you do, I guess? Oh, look, there's so many people do so much. The Catholic Care, they're all volunteers. REACH. We have REACH do meals in Newcastle as well. But I think... Yeah, my take from it is that communication and Orange Sky is... That's one of their main attributes as well, that communication with these people. Make them feel like they're somebody. Make them feel like they do have... It's giving them a sense of worth. Would that be the word? Yeah, just clean clothes, a conversation. Got to make everybody feel better for the day, including me. And the other thing, I had to use my head a lot with the journey with Orange Sky as well. We went from one system of rostering and everything onto the Volobi system and there was... So I've had to put the thinking tank on a lot and then stepping up into that SC role. Operating through Asana, I've been out of the workforce for quite some time. Some years. So it was like a bit of a challenge, but good for me. That's so interesting. That's the first time I've heard one of the volunteers talk about the tools and the things that you get to experience as a service. I've had to learn, yeah. That's a good advice, girl. What is it that you would say to someone if they were thinking about volunteering, but kind of on the edge? Do it. Just do it. Just come join us. So cool. Cool. I reckon that's it. I was going to take a quick photo. Yep. I have some to give to you too.\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Julie Jaunty\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nOkay. Alright, so just your full name and spell it. Sorry, one more time. Yeah. Julie Jaunty. J-U-L-I-E, jaunty, J-A-U-N-C-E-Y. Tell us a tiny little about yourself first. I'm in my mid fifties. I used to do nursing. I gardener unexpectedly had a stroke four and a half years ago. Otherwise, I wouldn't be coming here today 'cause I've lost function in one hand.\n\nAnd even though I've got a washing machine, having this services invaluable because I can't take online or go up and down steps. So unlikely people are using this service. I really appreciate it. That's cool. Casper, what are you doing? What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\n\nEverything was blamed on Covid. I had literally my straight, literally when Covid happened, all the hospitals got closed down and services. So it's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to [00:01:00] work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. Tell us tell us a bit about the, how you feel being at shift is what, like what sort of shift? Six shift. Oh. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\n\nI am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to [00:02:00] be unusually nice. I was, a bit hesitant. I'm thinking, oh, what sort of people gonna be here? But there's a lovely experience. You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\n\nI'm, I have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand. That's cool. And what's the, what do you think the main takeaway for you is in terms of what orange Sky does as a whole?\n\nIs it, do you think it's more about the washing, the people connecting the services? I actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. [00:03:00] So That's wonderful. That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\n\nYeah. How do you represent yourself? I guess in that big picture of things, I find myself unusually disadvantaged. I wouldn't have thought I'd be disadvantaged five years ago, but I had a straight four and a half years ago and you cannot access services and so that just made it very difficult. I know I can speak okay, but I walk quite weird and hand functions and what it used to be, so unlikely people.\n\nReally need this service or can access services, but everybody says, oh, wait to go on NOS or wait to. Those things take years and you've gotta get your washing done every week or two weeks. So it's really good to have that service in between. True. And what do you think about life as a whole in terms of the community?\n\nDo you see a lot of struggle or, yeah. I live from Elizabeth, which is like a disadvantaged suburbs supposedly, and I [00:04:00] do see a lot of like homelessness in parks and people going to food vans and all that sort of thing. But I'm. I've only got my advice point of view, but I just think there are a lot of, if people are hungry, especially you can always get food.\n\nBut getting washing done or home, like I know people that are living in cars or doing the couch surfing thing. I. I've got a friend who has only moved to the country. Two years ago she, her and her mom were in long term rental, 19 years. So they presumed it was like their house. They were given three months notice to move by the landlord and they just couldn't afford a place.\n\nSo they bought a dumpy house, middle of nowhere to to stay for roof over their heads. So unexpected people can be homeless. So true. What's it's always interesting to get your take on what this shift is like. So could you walk through how that, how it happened in terms of like A, how did you know about it and then B, what does it feel like?\n\nWhat's it like to be Okay. I heard about like paddle jumpers can paddle [00:05:00] jumpers, and then they, other people told me about the orange sky van, which I thought was very. Help, helpful. I didn't know about it beforehand. I don't use the internet or Facebook or all those sort of normal things 'cause of my funny hand.\n\nSo I was unaware. I'm quite sure that there's advertising, but I just wasn't aware of it. Cool. And what's it what sort of a normal shift look like for you? Normally people try to get here five o'clock for for when the sort of lineup with their washing and the van turns up when it turns up and people are quite happy then people.\n\nYeah, it just seems to be the routine. You get your spot, van turns up, gets something to eat, and then you come back and have a chat around the back of the van. It's mainly being a lady, so it's nice. That's cool. That's awesome. Is there anything that you've always wanted to talk about around Orange Sky yourself that we didn't talk about?\n\nI would like to know how you can advertise it to other people who wouldn't. Like I didn't know about the service point. Who wouldn't normally? [00:06:00] No. 'cause I wouldn't have, I've got a house I wouldn't have considered myself homeless. I wouldn't have known that I needed hands with washing or mainly hanging out.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know how you can actually inform other people. It's a great service. I've been told they go to different places on different days, but I don't quite know if everybody who needs a service knows about it. Seems to be a few regulars turn up, but not other people. Awesome. Such good feedback.\n\nNo worries. I'll I'll have to, yeah. I think the idea with this stuff is like your insight Yeah. And your knowledge Yeah. Is way more than anyone could ever Yeah. From Bruce Head office. Yeah. It's super helpful. Okay, great. Good to help. Thank you. I'm just gonna take.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "David Maguire: A lot. Yeah, it's good. I think we can do whatever now. We're at the end of the whole journey. Yeah. Whatever happens from here is fine. Which is good. All right. We'll start with the basics. David Maguire. Yeah. Okay, then. You need to tell me. Sure. You will need to remind me. Believe me.\nAll right. I want to make this as casual and real as we can. It's been five days, yeah? It's gone fast, eh? Maybe let's start, like, I don't think I've even asked you, like, how did you first even interact with Australia in general?\nWow. If I, I think how everything started working with Australia, I remember, I think it was 2015, if I remember well. And it was because I'm the chief executive in the UK. And there were some press, the BBC, came to Spain to see what we were doing. And we came for a few days, maybe a couple of days, three days to different centres. They were shocked about what they saw in terms of the change or the difference between the different between the UK and Spain.\nAnd from there, with the BBC and everything out, I had a phone. Well, I had an email. And some interest from Claire, Ferby, from, it was from Save the Children in Melbourne, who was the first person coming here to Australia. From there, I have lost count about how many people from Australia. And it has been. The attention has been increasing because I know because since 2015, I've had a close relation with Australia.\nI would never have thought about even the interest from Australia about us, the agrama. But also, I was so, I don't know. So. So. I was engaged by everything that was happening there. Because in 2018, well, a few people came, Olga came from from NT. And in 2018, I believe it was, I was invited to speak in Adelaide. Already I have spoken about Melbourne, NT, Adelaide. And I haven't been there. Not yet.\nAnd I went in 2018. I gave a speech. And the same day, I was giving that speech about how we work, what was our ethos, our principle, why we work. And we believe that it should be done by, in this way, we work with kids. Same day, it was riots in Dundale. Then the attention, the press attention came to me. And I was like, I mean, it was incredible. I was going to go just for this only speech I was going to give for this conference.\nBut I stayed three weeks, pretty much, from one day that it was. And I wanted to make the best of the trip. I went to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide. I flew to Alice Spring. And I spent like a whole week also in NT. Dundale, meeting people, was manic. And that is how everything started. I was, yeah, attracted to everything that was happening in Australia. I'm intrigued me about how it was so different from, what it should be. Why was so much violence in these centres?\nI could see some similarities with the UK. More about repression, more about lack of, when I say education, I don't mean schooling. I mean, pure parenting education. No model, no... And that is what intrigued me. And also, I had so much time, not just in the 24 hours coming, but also there to think about everything I saw, to analyse. I was in that moment also doing my doctorate in comparing countries, justice in Spain and the UK, that I also was putting that mixture, I was putting Australia.\nAnd from then, I've had so many more visits, until a point where in 2019, we were asking NT to give, to do a report of what we will do and how we will do things in NT, particularly. What we will do and how we will do things in NT, particularly. What we will do and how we will do things in NT, particularly.\nThen it was another few weeks where I went with two colleagues of mine. One was from the UK, one from here, from Spain, both with huge experience in the Judas Disorder in the UK and in Spain in centres. And we had the great chances to... It was the best trip ever because it was us, relationship with families, with Aboriginal people. We had the great chance to work in this centre for a whole day, from 6 o'clock in the morning to, I don't know, night, late night, to see how everything worked, to analyse very carefully. You cannot imagine the enriching conversation we had later, coming back to our accommodation and we were speaking and speaking. It was very tiring, I have to say, but very enriched for everybody.\nMy colleague here in Spain, in the UK and myself, just thinking how everything could be done. Also, not just comparing with the similarities with the UK, but there are some similarities with the Spanish system, so working as aumnya from the last 40 years one the the third bi CID I think is really important, because in the crisis we had a lot of problems. When we first started and finished, the population, our기를 and I, for the first time in the last 20 years, uh, 15 of 12. In the first 20 years, we had a lot of problems.\nAlso, we were working at the beginning, we were very conductual and how we progress. I mean, what you've seen this week is not how we started. Everything has a progression. You've seen the final product, which is incredible. I'm pretty sure that if we come again in 10 years, it will be different. The same over there, I keep the same. It's the same ethos, the same principles. What you've seen, key in relationship, key in education, thinking that the pure objective of custody is rehabilitation. Punishment itself is the judge who said, this crime needs to be sentenced this amount of time in this centre. That is where the punishment finishes. Now we shouldn't be focusing on punishing that two years or that sentence, or that two weeks, whatever. That time shouldn't be the punishment.\nNow we need to think about our role, not being judges. It's just... It's just to think what we... All those strengths that these kids have, focusing what we need to do, drawing a plan with them. They are part of the plan. They need to have a say, because we cannot force anyone to be integrated. They need to want to be integrated. And between what we do, also the community, because we are... We are working a lot with the community, families. I mean, it's impossible to think that we do miracles. We just work with the kid, then nothing will change. We need to work with the kids and also everything that is surrounding them. Then we work with the families very closely, with the community very closely. We have great support with politicians, support from civil servants, and at the end we are on the same page. And the same page is to reduce reoffending.\nAlso, we were speaking in that trip we had in Australia. We were speaking about the public opinion, of course. The public opinion is very similar everywhere, in terms of no one wants young offenders surrounding them, basically. The great difference between the UK and Australia, in this case with Spain, is politicians, they don't use the youth justice as a... Oops, it's going to be... This is Spain. But they are not going to use the youth justice as a political tool for them to have more votes. That is... That is something that I think is the greater difference. But if we speak about the public opinion, it's very similar.\nI remember one person, I think it was Jesus Teruel, who said, we have half of the community, they criticise us because they think that we are too soft, and they are in a holiday camp. Because we get on very well with them, we make them work, but they are also enjoying while they are there. And we are criticised because they think that we should be tougher.\nBut on the other hand, we have another 50% who criticise us because they think that no kids should be in custody and no kids should be incarcerated. And they would say that all the... rehabilitation or re-educational centres should be closed. And we are not a holiday camp, we are not Guantanamo, we are in the middle. We have very clear what we want to do with the kids, which is to make them realise that there is other options in the community, that they have the choice to stop re-offending, and they have a future.\nAnd something that we've been speaking about all these five days is we have very high expectations for our kids in custody. Not just us, it's everybody. They can achieve. We need to push them to be better in everything. And it's something that they get very well. The kids, when they come, they come, like I saw in Australia, with very low self-esteem. And you've seen all of them, even the posture, how proud they are in the whole process, how they look at your eyes and they tell you everything. I couldn't see that in Australia. I could see people with very low self-esteem, kids, I could see not looking at your eyes, be ashamed of something that they've done. And I'm feeling fear. What's something that I can do?\nOne thing that, capturing what one of the kids said in the centre is, they feel safe. The thing that makes them want to change is that they don't need to look behind if something happens. They can be themselves, they can be just kids, and just focus in the process of rehabilitating. And that is the atmosphere that we create. They are not fearing anything. They don't fear about the members of staff doing anything to them, the other kids, they don't do anything to them. And that is something that should be created in Australia.\nThat happened, my last visit was in 2019, pre-pandemic. Last year we have Kate, Lorana, coming and visiting also, I mean, continuing. It's very sad to, because again, I'm very attached now to Australia. I've been working there since 2015, basically. Then I get all the news, and normally there are no good news. Normally it's that things are the same, nothing has changed, not even... I think it's the hearing, and I think that was in 2016, if I'm correct, or 17, around there. That was because of the panorama in Dundale. Now I know about Queensland. I know the positive, that we need to have the positive of people wanting to change, putting the minimum age to 14, that would be amazing. But there is so much to be done. This is not just... This is not a war that you can just put in parts on the wall. This is a war that needs to be just destroyed, and start from scratch. Because if not, the war will be exactly the same war, but it will be very weak. For making a very good war, we need to have good foundation, good legislation, and do things very different from what is happening there.\nDavid Maguire: Can you also explain a bit, like, what should Australia expect if we're looking at change, and we're looking at doing something different? You've done it a few times before. How can we walk into this with our eyes wide open, rather than thinking that this is... We're just going to try this and it doesn't work out? How can we provide the right amount of resource, the right amount of mindset, the right amount of resilience as adults? Yeah.\nWhat is going to happen? I mean, the first thing is finding the politicians with the guts to make this happen. Finding the people from... the civil servants that they really want to change. Are you going to see what you've seen here in Australia in six months? No. I can tell you by now that it will take time. Are you going to wait 30 years that we did here? No. Lucky enough, I envisage that what you've seen here, it will take time between two and four years. That is what change takes place. And the key thing is changing the mindset.\nWe can find good member of staff, we can find legislation I'm not very worried about. Well, not worried about at all, because we can adapt to the legislation in place. The key thing is the mindset. I know that 50% of the people from government, from civil servants, from the public sector, or even more than 50% will be against, because they think that we treat them too well. But I think I need to capture what somebody said. I think it was the first day. We are looking after somebody else's kid. And all these people, who will be against us at the beginning, and I'm praying that this is not going to work, because that will help. I mean, we will have that type of people that they want this to fail. They need to think, well, what if they were their kids? That is the key part. Because these are kids. I mean, that is the bottom line.\nPatient, because we are not going to have everything right from day one. We are not going to have everything right from day one. We are going to have mistakes, I'm pretty sure. Mistakes for us is part of the learning process. I don't know anyone with no mistake in their life. But it will be a good journey. And more when you see the good stories. When you start having good stories, at the beginning it's like, oh, the first one doing this, or the first one doing... Later that is the norm. But it will be the contrary. Now the norm is all bad stories. And you might have one good story about one person. Later will be the opposite. It will be everything is good stories. Well, yeah, one kid had a mistake. And that's it. That is what I will say.\nAnd to believe in this, to think, okay, then this is what we need to do. This is the plan. This is where we want to be in two or four years. There is going to be a process of failing, of succeeding. But at the end, everybody will gain. It will be very good for the kids, 100%. It will be very good for the families and community in general. When I say community, I'm not just speaking their communities. It's going to be everybody. Because of different reasons. You will be safer because they are not reoffending. Don't forget that, again, what we've been speaking. With this model, we have around 16, 20% reoffending. What we have in Australia is 83% reoffending in three years. It's very different. And that saves money. That saves, one, everybody feels safe. Second is save money because the use of police will be going down. Use of judges, lawyers, prosecutors will go down. This is an investment. At the beginning, it will be, I'm not going to say more expensive than now. It will be the same. But I can tell you that this model is much cheaper than what is going on in Australia. And it's because when you are just focusing in security, security, security, everything, you make everything very expensive. It's like if you want a pure, secure car, you are going to buy a tank. And it's the most expensive vehicle you can have. It's better to have a secure car where you go to the correct speed and yet you can have an accident. But for that, you have airbags. That is what I would say.\nDavid Maguire: Does this violate all of the important people that support young people, families, courts, like the centre itself, the police? Does everyone need to buy into this for this to work? Or is it a process of overloading? Is it a long period of time that might happen and might not? How does that buy into the success?\nWe should be, I mean, ideally, and now we are, you've seen pretty much all the sector and we are on the same page here. Ideally, the best thing will be everybody on the same page. I know because we had the same. That doesn't happen like that. But someone needs to drive. When I say driving, this needs to come from someone. That someone normally is politicians. The politicians are the ones who have the power to make the change. If they want that happening, I know that they can change policies.\nHow many policies the police has. That changes. They decide, okay, now we are going to start arresting people. Arresting people. They are going to start engaging with the community. They engage with the community. Then if that drive helps everybody to be as close as possible. We are not going to be on the same page, but as close as possible. And with the same vision. Yes, things are going to go wrong, but not as wrong as it is now. That is the first thing. Cannot be worse. But also in a few years you can see how everything changes. And that is, I mean we have done it in several other countries. I work in the UK and I have been told I was not going to be able to do several things. We have done it. The people normally get focused in what cannot be done. What is going to be all the difficulties. Yes, difficulties. We know that we are going to have difficulties. You have seen the relationship and we even question. Oh relationship. What about is a culture thing about, I don't know, hugging a kid. Well, in the UK all the services we have, we have the same relationship you have seen here. And they are in the UK. They are English. I have been in Australia and yesterday we were out. Or two days ago. And some people who have been in Australia and they were from the Netherlands. They were saying how great people were the Australians. The best people ever. Then I feel that we will have problems. I don't see nothing that whatever you have seen here. Nothing that cannot be done over there. With the correct mindset. Everybody needs to buy into it. Or as many as possible. But yeah, I know that bad people are everywhere.\nDavid Maguire: Can you talk a little bit about, it's hard to put my finger on, like just experiencing and interacting with it. But there is something special about the educators at the centre and the interaction that they have. And the relationship between being a supporter, friend, you know what I mean. What's like, what do you think are ideal characteristics of an educator? And is some of it learnt and taught to be like that? Or is a lot of it the person that you reach for attention from? Yeah. What do you need to be a good educator basically?\nI cannot even tell you how many recruitment process and interviews I've been there. It's simpler than what you think. Even said that, it's very difficult to find the people. You need good people. Which is to have one person when you meet them. And when you are interviewing one person, it's to genuinely you can see that it's a good person. And intelligent. It's very simple what we need. It's very difficult to have the same person.\nBut as you said, it is so, we don't need someone with a lot of qualification. We don't need someone with a lot of experience. In fact, I would say, if someone has been 30, 40 years, they bring a lot of experience. But they've been 30 or 40 years doing it in the same way. Which means that for this, that is what we need is to do something totally different. The less experience, the better. Life skills. We have a lot of people with life skills. In Spain, by law, you need to have qualifications. University degrees for working in custody as an educator with kids. In the UK, I don't need any qualification at all. The qualification doesn't mean that it's going to be a better worker or not. To be honest, it's the life skills.\nWe normally find people who have, apart from here, for instance, in Spain. Apart from being... I don't know, a teacher qualified or social worker qualified or psychologist or whatever. That they start as an educator. That they also have the experience of being a referee with kids. Being a lifeguard. A football instructor. Somebody who can relate with kids easily. This is what we try to find. Somebody who is very proactive. You've seen all the educators here. You haven't seen one sitting down. You've seen all of them engaging. All of them proactive. You've seen people playing football all together. Dancing Zumba all together. And even with management. And it's their job. Yeah.\nThey need to see that we are not ashamed to enjoy. I mean, imagine. We tell them how to spend leisure time. How do we spend before going to custody their leisure time? It's not the same way. We need to teach them and to show them that they can enjoy without drugs. Without breaking into houses. Without breaking into cars. There are a lot of things that they can do. But we need to show them. And show them that there are those other parts. And those are the key things of the educator. They are very proactive. Very open. They listen. They speak. That is the idea. If you think what makes a good father a good mother. That will be the response. It's good parenting. And they never give up on the kids. Our own kids are going to be in trouble. The kids in custody are going to be in trouble. We don't give up. We are just trying and trying until there is something that engages them. And they carry on.\nDavid Maguire: One thing that I noticed and it kind of was a surprise to me in a way. I didn't really dig into the amount of procedures and principles and things that you have in an organisation. Until probably after that first visit. And everything seemed quite natural and emergent. And flexible. But as I went to each centre I realised even though there is a board and there is a paper. And they are just stuck up. It's actually the same in all of the centres. Why is it so important to... Have things that are structured in the same way across everything. And what does that bring to the model. But also how do you make it look like you do it. Totally natural.\nIt's funny because if you think in... If you compare centres Australia and Spain. You would say... Yeah. In Australia they are very tough because... They are very tough in general. However the kids can do whatever they want. They go to school if they want. They go to... They are engaged if they want. There is no... We are tougher. If you think about we are much tougher than Australia in terms of structure. We don't force anyone. That is the thing is we don't force anyone to do anything. Everybody is getting up at 8 o'clock and it's everyone. You haven't seen one kid in the room. In one, two, three, four, five centres that we've been. Not one kid in the room. All of them doing their activities. We've spent like between four and five hours in all of them. No one incident. And it's... The structure is so essential. They know exactly what is going to happen. Don't leave anything for... Depending what is going to be the day. You need to go...\nBeing proactive is what I said before. It's like the kids need to know what they are going to eat. Who is going to be there. Because you need to take from them all the information. All the anxiety that can happen of not knowing. That happens to our own kids. They go to school. They know everything. What happens is your own kids say, I don't want to go to school. You encourage them. Come on. You need to go and... Yeah, I feel sick. Yeah, you feel sick or you don't want... Oh, it's raining. And at the end they go. And you do it very normal. We do exactly the same. We normalise in... Do they want to do football every day? I'm pretty sure they won't. However, it's encouragement. It's like, come on, we are going to compete. It's like knowing them and knowing where you can touch what they are going to like. And everything... Everybody, even the kids that you were speaking with, they were saying, what would you change? It's too many rules. They said that. And they say, what would you suggest to do in Australia? To put all those rules. Which is funny because they know, they really know at the beginning, they fight against the rules. That is every single teenager do the same. And push boundaries is what they need to do as a teenager. And then... But they know that the reason they feel safe is because there are rules everywhere. And they were suggesting and advising the Australian government, to put those rules because those rules are needed. At the beginning it's hard, but when you think about it and you are around... Yeah. It's what makes everything very civilised, basically. They respect each other because they know the rules. And that is... It was funny to hear that from the...\nI mean, imagine, tell one thing that you would put over there. All these rules that I hate. But everybody knows that they need the rules. We need the rules.\nDavid Maguire: I... One other thing is... It usually takes me a few months to get into a centre. So many checks, so much risk that relates to me bringing something in. Or anyone bringing something in. But... Yeah, coming into the centres here, I just felt open, welcome, with my phone in my pocket. Is that a... Is that like a... Is that built into the principles and process? Or is that just something in which is another area of trust and openness in regards to the centre? Like where does that opportunity to be able to bring lots of people in really open come from? Is that built into the model?\nThat is bringing to the model in terms of risk management. We have a very clear risk management procedure. And what is the percentage that you are going to bring anything to any of these kids? You don't know them. They don't know even your language. The common sense says nothing is going to happen. About you having a mobile phone. 80% of these kids go to the community. They are not... They don't want your mobile. They have their own mobile when they go to the community. Because remember we've been speaking about the key privilege that they can have. And that is the difference between one country and the other.\nTo go to Australia, privilege, pocket of crips, more token, more time in the playstation. You come here and it's going outside, more time with an educator outside, more time spending outside, more time with the families. It's a totally different, more... I don't know. It's a purposeful objective what they have. And we need to prepare them. That is the reason. I think some... For those who have come from Australia and the UK to our centres, they are amazed about how our risk management procedures. It's common sense. It's everything you feel safe... And everybody who... I mean, I have separate secretary of state. I have several people. Everybody feels safer in our centres than in any of the other centres and I think pure security is the objective. In our one, you don't feel that you don't have any risk with young offenders around you and so on. Eating with you, you've been eating with them and enjoying conversation, very intelligent conversations. And that is like... That is what I said about this model in Australia would make everybody, even the community safer. Because what we are moulding is small kids that they are in the process of being a person. We are making good people who wants to work very hard and be somebody in life. That is what we do. Common sense seems to come through in so many of the parts.\nDavid Maguire: The one thing I'm obsessed about is... The question for me is why... Why we can't get to the stage where we do the visitation in Australia with that kind of model at all. Why did you have a hypothesis or some kind of guess as to in Australia how... Why we haven't done that already and why it's so important I guess to be able to have time outside.\nBecause then if you were in a different... Again, what you've seen is this. The final... The final, final, final product. When we started, we were very similar to Australia. Our kids couldn't go outside. Our kids, they were very violent in their centres. Our kids, they don't have... Our expectation is... I hope they don't fight today. That is how we started. But we realised that that was not helping anybody. We were not helping the kids, the community or ourselves. No one likes to go to a war every day. We were going to a place that you never knew was going to happen because there was no such structure. We were trying to put the structure but the kids, they were not buying into it. Because they also had the culture of... I'm not going to do it. And that happened also. Because in the same way that members start with 30 years of experience doing it in the same way, you have kids with 5 years of experience or 3 years of experience of a different way of custody. But these kids go. And you start to have kids with no experience in custody. And how it should be or not be. And then is when we started to experiment. But the experiment wasn't like what we were doing. Let's try one thing and the other. We changed the whole law. From one day to another. In 2000 we had the new legislation which changed everything. It changed the minimum age. It changed when they could go to prison. Instead of being before I was 16, I went to prison. Now I'm 18. They can stay in the centre the whole sentence. If they are progressing well in the centre.\nWhy in Australia has not been done before? I think there are very historical things that happened like 20, 30 years ago. I think the rhetoric of the politicians has been different there than here. Remember, I think I spoke about that one day with you. In terms of, remember that we come from a dictatorship. They are going. No. They are going to stay here. They are going to stay here. There are different politics around. You know, we've been speaking. In my opinion there are three countries and they are far away each other. And those are Australia, UK and the US. And they are very similar. Politicians are very similar. The message to the people. To the public is very similar. The use of the justice in politics is very similar. That doesn't happen in other countries. It's not like that can happen in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, here. Of course it's going to be some cases in the press because of extreme violence. Of course. I mean that is something that we will always have. But we've been through everything I think a little bit earlier. And because we were in a worse situation. We were in a dictatorship. There was going to be, there could not be worse than that. But we progress and thinking about this is not working. We need to do something else. And something else that needed to be dramatically changed. And also we need to think about the United Nations, the children rights and so on. We need to, that is what we need to see. That is what we need to achieve. And you couldn't see any of our professional having any doubt about we are fulfilling all the children rights. We can improve by far. I think I started saying in 10 years time it will be different. The core will be the same. The ethos. We will be having the same conversation in terms of relationship. Same conversation. But we will be thinking, yeah but we need to improve. All the time.\nDavid Maguire: Alright, one last question I reckon. Say you've got a, like a premier in Queensland or whatever in there. Like they sit down and they said I've got like five minutes to sign this bit of paper to. Give me the pen. Give me the pen. What would you say in the five minutes to them to get them over the line to say why should diagrammer have a chance to be tested in Australia?\nI will start. I will do like a brief of everything that we've seen is we are speaking about looking after kids. These are not adults. We need to understand them. We need to know who they are. Why they are there. And what we need to do to break the cycle of reoffending and reoffending. We need to for doing that. We need to. We need to engage with families and community. And everybody will gain from doing this. It will work. I mean I have no doubt. That is something that somebody could say, oh yeah, it will work. I have 100% because I didn't know if it was going to work or not in the UK working with different profile. It will work. That is the bottom line.\nAnd in a few years, they can have their votes if they want. But it will be good for those that they vote because they are going to feel safer. That is 100%. They are not going to be scared going anywhere. They are going to be cheaper. That is something that will engage them very quickly. Much cheaper in the whole system, youth justice system. And we will be improving communities. At the end of the day, it's like if we can change just a few percentage. And maybe things that we are doing now. We will see in 20 years that everything has a totally new dimension. But I would say it cannot be worse than now. What is the risk? Really? No, this could be a risk. The only risk could be for themselves not having votes. But it's not risky for the kids. It's not risky for the member of staff, for the communities, families. The whole community. It's going to be much better. I would give it a try because it's worth it. You cannot imagine how... You can't imagine because you've seen it. They cannot imagine how happy the kids, the community, everybody involved, and how proud they were.\nEvery single one person you speak about, the way that they speak, their eyes, their passion, any kid. They are proud of being part of something. Something. And this is the something.\n",

      "Transcript": "Cool, Bradley, just talk to me. Alright. So go, just your full name and spell it first up. My name's Chris Dwyer, CHRS, Christopher, DWYER. Cool, man. Tell us how you first heard about Orange Sky. I heard about Orange Sky through just normal media. So general media, I probably saw it on television generally. Didn't know anybody who worked for Orange Sky, but got interested in the organisation only because it's not really aligned with any larger organisation, particularly any religious organisation, that do do great work in the charity sector. But really, I was drawn to Orange Sky, yeah, just through the work that the two guys started up in Brisbane and it sounded like a good match for me. Cool, man. What were you doing before, or what are you doing now, or what were you doing before? What were you doing kind of when you first started? So I'm a just full-time public servant with a young family. I found I had a lot of downtime that I was putting toward my family and work. I found gaps in that that I thought, oh, well, okay, I've got a bit of spare time. How can I use that, not on myself or my family? They come first. They're not going to be the first for the community at large. Cool, man. How did you find the first bit and what's been the trajectory for you? My initial introduction to Orange Sky was really positive. There was a very good onboarding process. It was COVID. It was online. But that still worked very well for me. And then even more positive when I met the team here at the Cross Church Cathedral Newcastle service. We're very opening support. Very opening supporting and very experienced. So, yeah, it's only been a really good experience for me. Yeah. Cool, man. How do you find the connection part of it? There's the washing, but there's also conversation and connection for people. What's that element like for you? So, good question, Ben. Operationally, it's pretty simple. You do people's washing. You dry it and then you fold it and get it away. Really challenging for me is that discussion and conversations you have with friends. They're from all walks of life. All different life experiences, different ages. Mostly men, I must say. But the challenge for me is knowing how to mould conversations to get the best out of what we do. But also knowing what not to say. I think there's a bit of magic in knowing when to pull back and not asking too many incisive questions that can not upset but steer our friends. Seeコーラ find out I work for Orange Sky, people's eyes light up. There's a good general knowledge about Orange Sky's work which surprised me in my circle of friends and acquaintances and work. A lot of people ask how to get involved. A lot of people don't realise that additional layer that you've just mentioned of the importance of the conversations with our friends. It's not just washing clothes. People are generally really very interested in the concept behind Orange Sky, how it began. A lot of people also are interested in the actual demand and understanding are there really homeless people out there? Do they need this service? To which the answer obviously is yes and it's increasing. That piques a lot of my friends interest in the conversation. I think that's a really good example of how we can get involved. I think that's a really good example of how we can get involved. I think that's a really good example of how we can get involved. I think that's a really good example of how we can get involved. A lot of my friends are just protected from that layer of society that needs our assistance and the increasing assistance. Cool. Hey, this is weird but I'm just going to take a photo because the sun's just doing something awesome and whenever it does that it always goes away and I think, geez, why didn't I just take a photo before? Cool, mate. Last question. If someone's on the fence, not sure about volunteering, maybe it's because they're not sure about hanging out with people, expressing homelessness, maybe it's the washing shirt, what would you say to them about taking a step to volunteer ownership? Take a step. It's all about experience. First step is probably the hardest ones. Even if you are concerned about either side of that, come for a look at a service. Ask a friend who you know is doing it, just come along for a trial or come along and see what we do. See how easy it actually is. The time spent can vary but that's part of volunteering. Highly recommend it to anybody thinking about giving their time and knowledge to other people who are less fortunate than ours. It's rewarding in itself. You don't have to be a special person to do it. You just have to be a normal, high-thinking person out there to help. Somebody that, you know, we could be in their shoes, could have been in their shoes, can be in the future. Looking out for others. Well done, man.\n",

Um, I'll just ask questions. Okay. And then, yeah, anything else you want to add after. Mm hmm. I'll probably do that too. Um, cool. So just start with your name and spell it.\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Um, my name is Alyssa Dawn Brewster. A L Y S S A.\nSpeaker 2: Amazing. And tell us a little bit about what you do on the\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: island. Yep, so I work with the Elders on the Justice Reinvestment. Um, and I do a lot of the finance, the admin, as well as community engagement. Helping out Taryn with school holiday programs.\nSpeaker 2: Cool. Um, Tell us a little bit about yourself, I guess, like, um, background, identity, whatever you'd like to go with it.\nYeah. So\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: I'm a proud Tongan woman. So my father is from the Noonaka tribe over on North Stradbroke Island, which we are here today. And my mother is from Brunette Downs, um, up in Northern Territory. Um, my dad, my father's from Bundjalung, [00:01:00] sorry. And, um, my mother is from Genebrawa and Gabi\nSpeaker 2: Gabi. Amazing. Yeah.\nCool. Tell us a little bit about, um, your involvement so far in the Justice Reinvestment stuff, super interesting work.\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Yeah, so, um, I jumped on around August, um, with all the team. So, you know, it's been amazing, um, being able to work within the community and helping the community as well because we know that We know what, you know, we need justice and yeah, it's just been really amazing to work alongside, especially with the Elders and, you know, being able to run school holiday programs like this for the youth, you know, it's, it's been really amazing.\nSpeaker 2: And tell us a little bit about, um, what went into planning the school holiday stuff and how it's been going.\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Yeah, so Taryn does a lot of the planning. Um, and then I help out every now and then with organising, um, the buses, or like transportation, etc. Um, but yeah, we let the Elders know and we get the input from the community on what was successful, [00:02:00] um, on our last school holiday programs, and then try to include the same thing but a bit different, um, depending on like the weather, if it's summer, winter programs, and things like that.\nUm, but yeah, we try to do a lot of the school holiday programs culturally based. So the Moreton Bay Research Station, um, where they learn about, you know, the marine life and our, you know, sustenance. And so yeah, it's for them to learn about culture as well as knowledge from, um, nowadays and how they, yeah, help the community as well.\nSpeaker 2: Um, tell us about today and a little bit about what we did today.\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Oh, so today a lot of the students learnt, um, well about, they were just doing a bit of a Finding how many, um, marine or sea life in, um, a box of shells, which was really cool. Um, a lot of the kids just dived in and found live crabs and yugarees and, and they were able to have like the Indigenous [00:03:00] name from a lot of the shellfish that they eat over here.\nUm, and they were able to find the shellfish, like oysters, that were really tiny, and they were like, Oh my god, I found it! So, it was, it was really lovely to see, um, them be so excited, and for them to, like, have that knowledge from their family, from what, you know, shellfish are called in the Indigenous culture.\nTo now and be able to share it with among friends and have that friendship going. So today was awesome and it was perfect because it's a hot day. We were in the aircon. So, no, it was, it was a good day. Very good day.\nSpeaker 2: And tell me a little bit more around like, um, what you think is important for the young kids to have things to do during the holidays and how that, um, affects, um, other parts of their lives and the island\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: as well.\nSo I've, I personally feel like is such an important aspect. Um, Because we're on North Stradbroke Island, it's a very remote area, there's not a lot to do, especially when it's raining and in the winter. [00:04:00] So these programs not only benefit them to give them something to do, it also helps them make friends, the communication, and getting to know their Elders as well, which is very important.\nUm, and, um, It's just amazing because we have, we have people who come over from over town to jump in on our programs. You know, it's free for the kids, they can come, they can engage, they can have a feed, and they can learn. And it's such, so important because then they can go, oh, there's this and this on.\nfrom the Elders, you know, let's make sure we go down there, you know, and it helps them to just find themselves as a person culturally and have an amazing friendship that goes on for a lifetime, which is an important aspect, I think. Amazing.\nSpeaker 2: And, um, just in terms of like the Elders, what's, what do you think their role is, um, in all of this?\nAnd, um, yeah, but I think the, um, there's a huge opportunity to engage them more. Yeah. [00:05:00] How does that, work?\nYeah,\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: so we are very, very lucky to have such amazing Elders on the island here. They do so much, um, they jump on to a lot of the school holiday programs that they can because They know how important it is, but they're able to make relationships with parents and children and have that kind of security.\nAnd they go around and pick the student, like pick the youth up. And it's that, that bonds between them, that the Elders can go to the shop and, and the young ones go, Oh, Aunty you know, and it's that trust. And I feel like that's such a really important here. And we're just so lucky. Like the Elders do so much.\nThey help with catering and. Transportation and help plan. a lot of these school holiday programs, so we're very lucky.\nSpeaker 2: Wow. Um, it's very early days, I guess, for the justice reinvestment stuff. Yeah. What's your [00:06:00] hopes and dreams, I guess, for the next little bit, um, as the program, program grows?\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Well, more of the school holiday programs, definitely, but I feel like, you know, our team is so strong and the community is so strong.\nSo being able to put through like, uh, more youth programs, um, more engagement activities. But yeah, I, I have a lot of positive thoughts on the future. It's just finding the words on what we can do, but You know, having that community input to see what they want on the, like, in community and that, how, how we can deliver that.\nSo, I feel like, as much as I want to answer, I feel like it's more for community that they can answer and then we can deliver.\nSpeaker 2: So cool. It's amazing. Um, is there anything you think we didn't touch on that you'd like to talk about, or I need to add, or?\nAlyssa Dawn Brewster: Oh, I think that was good. Yeah. Cool.\nSpeaker 2: Amazing. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcript": "Patricia Frank\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRock. I'm always looking for good frames. Bit of tie, little camera and yes, it's weird, isn't it? I never seen those sort before. Ready? Yeah. I'm ready to go. I wanna sit on something though. Nothing to sit on. Tell him to come here. There. Walkie. What name? Tatu.\n\nGet a mud brick old one over there. Oh yeah.[00:01:00] \n\nIs the heaviest seat I've ever sat on.\n\nI have to say. I, um, for run this morning with Georgina and I stacked it big time ah, at my shoulder. Oh, true. I'm, I'm coming. Good. Alright. You just have to, so say your full name and then spell it out. Yeah. So I don't stuff it up. Okay. Right. Go. Patricia Frank, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A. Frank, FRAN. Kate, how do you like to introduce yourself when you meet someone or.\n\nHow do you like to introduce your identity, that sort of stuff? How do you do my identity? I say my name, my language, and where I'm from. Nan Creek, John Cargo. Awesome. Mm-hmm. [00:02:00] Tell me, um, how do you talk about yourself? What's like a little, little history lesson about you? Um, I'm a local warmonger person, work with health.\n\nAboriginal corporation. We work, I work with, um, local people who are homeless, needing help and support in the community. Yeah. What's, um, how do you explain Tenant Creek to people? If I was to explain Tenant Creek, um, tenant Creek is a small town population of three and a half. And it, um, it's in the Barkley region and, um,\n\nwe, it's, I'm from Oo Tribe, which is situated, um, [00:03:00] in Nan Creek, and my clan group is the White Cocker two, and which is 30 Ks from Tenant Creek up north. That's Philip Creek. Cool. Um, are you able to talk about the white cockatoo stuff as in your story or is that something you can't talk about or, or what can you say about that?\n\nWell, I can just say white cockatoo is my dreaming clan group and, um, it's, it's situated at Philip Creek and it's a dreaming site, which. We follow from start to finish. And there's another one that I'm connected through. The white Cocker two is the, um, the Yala. The Spinifex works. Yep. And we make bush medicine out of Yala and it's really good stuff.\n\n[00:04:00] Mm. Is there, are there some things you wish. Like mainstream Australia knew about this area? Or, um, are there some things in which you are hoping you can help inform and provide knowledge to people, um, about yourself or the community or, or culture? What are some of the things you'd hope people could learn from you?\n\nTenant Creek is a small community, um, town, town, um, which has different language groups here. And everyone knows everyone. And if there's someone new coming to town, they know who's the new person in town or where they're from. Like, it's not everybody's secret. It's everyone's, everyone knows who's in town.\n\nSo everyone knows everyone. And if new people in town, you know, we could just ask someone and say, oh, that's, that person is [00:05:00] connected to that family group. Yeah. Okay. What are some of the things you're doing at the moment that you're excited about in terms of like, are you growing something, are you trying to do something?\n\nWell, we have an aboriginal organization, which we are trying to set up will agenda annual your will agenda. We're trying to set up that one for housing and we're, um, trying to start with our house. Culturally appropriate way. We're designing it to go with the, our culture fits in with our, um, climate as well.\n\nIt's climate friendly, house housing. Cool. Um, you took us out to a, an amazing place. Um, today. It was two amazing places. Um. What can you tell us about the welcome staff? Are you able to talk about that? Which one you did this [00:06:00] morning? The welcome we did this morning at the Riverbed, um, what it, uh, we went and did when with Jimmy and yourself, we went to like a Oh yes, yes.\n\nYeah. We went to Water Hole, which is called Jungo. And um, it's a War Moore site and it was a Warrimoo site where. It held water for our people in the 19 hundreds. And Baldwin and Spencer visited that time and stayed, I think three months. They stayed and watched the war and more people celebrate their ceremony and they were showing off their ceremony and they were, um, there were a lot of photos taken.\n\nSo these old peoples that, not around now, but they sorta. Um, connected up to these non-indigenous people, and they [00:07:00] were friends. You know, I think they understood who they were. They accepted them into the war, war country. Yeah. Is there a, is there a chance that we do that again, like at the moment, and how do we do that?\n\nLike, how do we continue to have successful partnerships like that in the modern day? We do it now. Like for example, you, you know, and Nick, Sally Georgina, you know, we accepted them and accepted you Mob to come to our OO country and um, you were special to us. You know, you're here to help us, not here to.\n\nUm, use us up and all that, but you're here to help us and support us as we go along and grow our organization. Mm. That's super special. Um, what's the, what do you hope that this [00:08:00] might grow into in terms of, um, what you're doing with your organization, but also I think you've got some dreams of some, some bigger stuff as well that on station stuff.\n\nLike what do you hope that turns into? Well. We wanna get bigger, we wanna help other people, other language group, other culture from different countries, how they wanna, um, how they want to, um, design their house using their culture, their language, their, their climate. And. You know, 'cause we all got different climates, we all got different languages, different culture.\n\nSo we want that to build our relationship up with other language groups and to make them happy too, you know, how they wanna live. Yeah. Awesome. Um, there's a specific focus not to work with government at the moment. [00:09:00] Is there a. Um, I suppose, could you explain that and, and like, almost like what's the future of that, do you think?\n\nIs there a movement away from that in the future if something changes? Well, I hope this new government will start listening to us. You know what we want because we are the First Nation people. Someone need to start somewhere and we're starting somewhere where we are gonna help, not just our war, more people, not just our family.\n\nWe wanna help family throughout the NT and their First Nation People. They are too, you know, same as us. Awesome. Um, are you doing some stuff with LT as well? What's, what's that sort, what's that stuff you're doing with lt? We're hoping to set up a, um, cultural tourism and cultural awareness [00:10:00] down the track.\n\nYeah. We are hoping to do that with tourists to do cultural awareness, um, within our, within our language groups. And within our country, and to teach people who wants to know about our language and culture and our, um, living environment and our languages, what's here? Mm, that's cool. What do you need to make that happen?\n\nWhat's the, what's the sort of things that you don't have that if you had them, you would be able to go, what's that? Sorry? What, what are the things you need to make that happen? Like, what do you need? Um, well first of all, if we're gonna set our cultural awareness business, we wanna try and, um, um, try and get money to build a building, to do cultural awareness, to do cultural tos or tag along tours to show our bush [00:11:00] tucker our.\n\nBush medicine, you know, uh, I do bush medicine already and we've done cultural awareness already, so we know what direction we're going. Mm. That's awesome. Um, it's been an intense few days of like learning and growing and, and doing stuff. Um, one direct question I had was, what do you reckon about these beds?\n\nOh, the beds. Yeah, I reckon they're deadly. Why do you reckon they'll work if they, I reckon they're hard and they're stable and they're, um, strong in a way. Yeah. And, and it's very handy. We, I, I'm trying, I wanna make a couch out of it instead of a bed. Mm mm. Where, um. [00:12:00] Sometimes it's difficult for Nick and I I think because I think betting is quite a serious problem and like there's not a lot of other solutions out there.\n\nSo sometimes we think ours might be okay 'cause it's a bit better. Um, what do you think we should do to keep, because we we're trying out washing machines and, and fridges and stuff. Like you've got any advice for us as we try to grow and, and help other communities and stuff as we, we do this, I reckon washing machine.\n\nSomething easy, simple that they can use without power to, 'cause there's people out in the, um, CLOs, they're little homeless people. They live out in Tin Sheds and they, they truly wanna a washing machine to wash their blanket, to wash their clothes, and it's right there at home. Mm-hmm. [00:13:00] Yeah, it's so cool 'cause we have so many options with washing machines.\n\nYeah. We've got hand ones, we've got like battery ones. We've got other ones. So yes. Awesome. Yeah. Um, yeah. Thank you so much for hanging with us. Yeah. Thank you. There anything else that you wanted to say on, on camera that you always wanted to No. No. You wanna talk shit about someone or, yeah, I.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Nicole Snead - Salvos\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nFirst and foremost, just your full name and spell it for me. Yep. So Nicole Snead, N-I-C-O-L-E-S-N-E-A-D. Tell me tell me about yourself first a tiny bit. Yeah. As you introduce yourself, identify those types. Yeah. Yeah. So I've am the core officer here at the Salvation Army, together with my husband John Ma.\n\nAnd we've been in full-time ministry for 18 years now and we love Hobart. We love its people. Yeah. And we wanna make lives better. That's so great. How did you first hear about this type of work? And you fall actively search it out. What was that like? So I grew up with the Salvation Army and I quite often say that I was born on a Wednesday and I was at church by Sunday, so it's a bit of a family thing.\n\nYeah. And so I wanted to do anything else but full-time ministry and so I Dion, sorry. [00:01:00] Just yeah, so my husband actually lost his job and so then we had to explore what we were gonna do as a family and what that looked like. And how do you argue with the creator of the world when he three times says, no, this is what I want you to do.\n\nAnd so this is what we're doing all these years later. Wow. What are the things that keep you here and keep you coming back? Yeah. Probably the stories of transformation, the stories of people changing their lives, and we are all about good news and we're all about hope. And so when people come back and they say, oh my gosh, I've got housing, I've gotta share this with you.\n\nThat's the stuff that keeps me going, and transformation looks different for lots of different people. And it could be as simple as a shower or it could be as simple as housing. Recognizing that those things are actually massive, so it's the little things that actually mean a whole lot.\n\nWhat are the range of support and stuff to do here? So we offer a community drop in space. We actually call it our third space. Recognizing that lots of people don't have. [00:02:00] Homes, they don't have work. For lots of different reasons, and family's not a safe place. And so we have a space that is open every day of the week during, sort of Monday to Friday.\n\nSo we do soup and toasting, we do emergency relief. We do wraparound holistic support. So if people, need pastoring or they just need someone to talk to, or they just wanna sit down and watch the news or read the newspaper, then that's the space that we offer. We have seniors, programs, youth programs programs for kids and as well as a worshiping or faith community as well.\n\nYeah. What's the relationship like with Orangeberg? Were you here? It started, yeah, we were. So we had one of our colleagues at the time called Stewart he came and approached us and said, Hey, I think we can do something together. And so we are like, yeah, for sure. And so we've been running our meal on a Sunday night for over eight years now.\n\nAnd so we've been partnering with Orange Guide just as long. And so when people come to this space. And they get not only a hot meal in their [00:03:00] belly, but the opportunity to have a shower and their clothes washed and dried. It's a beautiful partnership. What do you think is the impact that RPO has across the elements of, and.\n\nConversation. Yeah. Connection. What stands out for you? So recognizing that connection is actually hugely important. So it actually creates a community in and of itself. And so when you have that, and so it's a place of being known and belonging and inclusion and sharing life together, that is a beautiful space to be.\n\nAs well as alongside of the opportunity to have clean clothes. You feel human again, you feel known and that's actually really important for individuals, but also for communities as well. What do you think the sort of sentiment around homelessness in over, like in terms of from public perception to experience, is there a divide?\n\nIs it like. Supportive of each other. Where do you [00:04:00] cognize? So definitely within the homelessness community, recognizing that looks different for lots of different people. So it could be sleeping in our car park, it could be sleeping in parks or shop. Doors and windows and things like that, but it also could be short stay and not, secure accommodation as well.\n\nSo we recognize that it looks different for quite a number of different people and they look after themselves. And so it's in a community in and of itself who look after each other well. However, we recognize that can sometimes. Not work out, or sometimes there's personnel issues, relationship breaks down.\n\nSo sometimes that can be a bit tense within the wider sort of society and community here. We have definitely seen a rise in. The visibility of homelessness. So when we first arrived in Hobart 12 years ago, you wouldn't see lots of people on the street per se, recognizing [00:05:00] again that it looks different.\n\nBut that is certainly becoming more visible as the years go by, so you will see more people perhaps begging on the street or busking. To make a living. As well as you'll see blankets and things like that in shop doors and on the street and things like that. So it's certainly becoming much more visible within our little city.\n\nYeah. How do we and everyone partner, don't do it. Don't do it. Partner better to support everyone. So everyone from government to council to business owners. When you see that being a like really positive thing that people are coming together and you know that's possible. Yeah, we do. Yeah. I think the value of hearing each other's story is actually vitally important to this space and to, and for people to understand that most of the time it's not a choice.\n\nMost of the time it's because of circumstances, not of their own creating or it's because [00:06:00] something has happened to them and. Being in a house is just not safe for them, and so actually just recognizing the causes of homelessness from particularly when we think about schools and businesses and, governments, quite often the stigma attached to homelessness is around drugs or alcohol or violence, when that's perhaps not necessarily, accurate.\n\nAnd so hearing stories. Together is actually hugely important. Yes, we could build, a whole lot of houses and things like that, but if we just chuck a whole lot of people in a whole lot of houses, I don't actually think that's healthy for people. So I think that long-term, ongoing. Help and assistance walking alongside people so that they can function as best as they can within society, I think is also a valuable service that we could provide those really most vulnerable within our society.\n\nSo I think it's a both and situation. Oh fuck. [00:07:00] You've got such good answers. Sorry, I've given it some thought. Was there any elements we didn't touch on, you think? Important in this conversation around partnership and probably I think the fact that we are better together and we can do stuff in isolation, which is wonderful, but I actually think we work better for our people when we do things together.\n\nAnd so you know, that we know that we're not alone. The people that we serve and walk alongside know that they're also not alone, which I think is really important. So we, yeah, we wanna do stuff together. 'cause I actually think it betters us as people and betters us as a community, okay. Take a photo before this light.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I try and dress fresh, you know what I mean? I try and be clean. And I like the process of doing it, so that's why I like our own sky. I miss having a home, I miss doing that home procedure sort of thing. So I come here on a Tuesday, Catootlie neighbourhood on a Friday. Everyone's good, everyone's polite. Awesome. So what we're going to do, we're going to do your name, and then if you can spell it, that'd be awesome as well. Sure, my name's Wayne Tate. You just talk to me, it's fine. Yeah, W-A-Y-N-E T-A-T-E. Cool, man. You know, 47, born and bred here on the Central Coast. Actually went to Wollongong High School just down the road here. You know, it's sad to be in your own hometown and not have anything, and then to see the services pop up that make you feel comfortable in your own skin is awesome. I go to the truck stop out here at the freeway every day, shower. If it wasn't for the Orange Sky service, I wouldn't have the clean clothes to whack on every day. You know, I can walk amongst the supermarket, and not look like that homeless person if there's such a stigma, you know. Me, I'm a very self-cautious, confident sort of person, and I want that clean clothes. I want the services. The ladies are amazing. Everything. They let me fold, me washing. Everyone's told me that I fold it better than they do. I want to volunteer. I've got a volunteers check. When I find a home, I'd love to do some Orange Sky work. Everyone's polite. It's a shame that I've had the same van comes around. I reckon there should be a couple more vans that can go site to site, if they could probably put a few more out. Tell us a little bit about your story though. Like, who are you? What's your identity? Okay, I went to university, pharmaceutical manufacturer. I worked as a chemist here in Wyland Plaza for 15 years under the Hollingsworth. If you've been a local area, you'd know that. The Hollingsworth and the local family, the chemist here, owned a home, Norah Head, nice beach house. I was 30 year old before I had to sell that. I'm 47 now. So I've now since gone on my diploma in hospitality. Not having a base of a home and stuff like that. I'm not working, can't find work. So I was doing it hard, out of parks, linked to home, using the services to, to meet a gentleman and a kind gentleman that works as a train driver. Offered me his van, with no money up front, camper van, and to pay it off. So I get $700 a fortnight and I pay $500 a fortnight on my camper van. I have $200 to live. So once I throw $150 in a fuel tank of fuel to get to my showers, my orange skies and my services, which keep me alive, I'm left with $50 a week. I mean a fortnight. And that's basically deodorants. The things you need to keep clean and stuff like that. Without these kind of services, I don't, I dare say my depression would have taken over and I probably wouldn't even be here sitting and talking. You know? So I've been at both ends of the spectrum. Had a nasty divorce. My kids are all looked after, as in inheritance wise. So when I sold my half, my money went to the children. And then all that touch it to their 18. What else can I say? There's some nice people here. You know, like, you turn up, do the right thing. The ladies are so kind. They remember your name even on the second time coming. You know? Yeah. What's the reality for a lot of people in the Central Coast in terms of, are there a lot of people in your, in a similar position? There's people worse. There's a lot of people worse off. There's so much worse off in my position. I'm lucky to have that camper van. I've just had the clutch do. So I've got a $2,500 repair that the mechanic knows I'm homeless and just let me walk away with. Alright? I have to pay a little bit off, but he doesn't want me to pay it until this van's paid off and on my feet. So I've just had $2,500 worth of mechanic work done for nothing. So homelessness get helped. If you see the right people and you be honest about it. There's a lot of people who are just not paying it off. And I'm not saying that I'm not paying it off. I'm just saying that I'm not paying it off. I'm just saying that I'm not paying it off. There's a lot of people using the system as well. But there's a lot of people living in parks. Little humpy's tents here, tents there. I feel for them. So if I'm doing better than them, they come into my van, I'll let people charge things up. I'll help the situation. Putting the rent higher for people to struggle is not going to solve anything. The homelessness is getting worse and worse. What about like connection and conversation? And like all of those things. Do some people miss out on that? And is that a part of what services provide? That like human type stuff? Absolutely. I've got one friend I'm talking to now. And on my phone. The rest is all a pretentious Facebook message. The rest is all a pretentious Facebook message. People you haven't seen. So you do need that reality. You do need that... That rubbing shoulders with someone. Someone that doesn't judge. These people don't... These people that help you in these services, they don't seem to judge. I went to school with Kylie. In here. You know? They don't judge. Tukley Neighbourhood Centre, my first miss is this Aboriginal councillor and Samoan councillor there. There has been a conflict of interest they reckon. They'd rather me not go to Tukley to get my washing done and services. But they said it's okay for me to... If I need to. But... It is what it is. Um... If you see somebody that's homeless, you say hello. If you see someone that's in the same position, you make them feel like there's a conversation so you can have that vent or you can rub with the world and you still are worthy of something. Because it does take it away from you. It strips you bare. Um... What do you think... What do you think needs to happen from a community perspective to reduce... You were talking about stigma, right? What do you think people need to know or change in terms of the way in which they interact with people who are doing it a bit tough? You know what I mean? Like, are there things that people can do better? Well, people like myself that don't want to put themselves out there for a lot of help won't get help if you don't need it. So they could be maybe approaching these people and say, hey, you've got a bit more confidence in these guys. Obviously, there might be addictions that these people might have, but you're still rubbing shoulders with the same people. Maybe they can just take more interest in you. You're there for a reason. You know? So I can come to these places, do my washing, and then not one of these people, if you don't ask for it, will actually come forward to you. There's too many people wanting or needing the help. There's not so much want. So there could be a bit more but the ladies are all volunteering. The gentlemen all volunteer. You can't expect much more. You know? Everyone here has been great. Why do you think it's important, like, Orange Sky runs on donations? Like, there's not a lot of government support or that type of stuff. Why do you think it's important for, because it's a volunteer thing, right? They're not getting paid. Why do you think it's important to support that model and support Orange Sky to be able to do that through funding? Well, people get a great deal of satisfaction about volunteering. You can only get looked on any aspect. People volunteer across the board in so many different aspects. I actually thought they had that Orange Sky when I came with a major sponsor that was able to fund it. I wasn't quite sure that it works on donations alone. It would probably make it hard when there's a service down like there is today in the van. Things like that would make it difficult if the money's not sort of there. That's cool. Brad, I reckon that's it, brother. Yeah, good. I reckon, what would be awesome, like, I'm going to take a quick picture. If you want to just stand up for me. You've got to go out particularly on Friday to do this? Yeah, Friday. Yeah, they told me to go out to Orange Sky on Friday and I thought, no, I need Washington between now and then. Came in early. Alright, brother, just look out in there. Do you want to take one without glasses? Yeah. Alright, one sec. Oh, that's very bright. So you're a photographer or you're just running around? I dabble in lots of things. Photography's one of them. It's Marvel or whatever you want to do. Just come over here for a sec. I'm just going to get out of the sun. If you're there, this will be helpful. Yeah, because you're out of the light. Mate, you know what you're talking about, don't you? Alright, one sec. Alright. Cool. Maybe go out more, so you're like almost, you're, and... Yeah, awesome. What would be awesome to do is just get like a couple of random shots of maybe you and your van and you with your washing machine. Yeah, no. Do you want to wait until your washing comes or? Ah, let's go and check out your van. Yeah. Do you like it? Do you mind just parking in one parking spot? Yeah, I will.\n",

Amazing. Tell me a bit about Palm Island first. I want to know a little bit about what you think of Palm Island. Oh, Palm Island is a beautiful place. It's like a four and a half thousand people, population.\nWe have a service provider that flies in and out. It's a place where you can, come and go. Even though if we go away on a trip, we always come back to the farm. It's always armed to us. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about the situation in some of the homes, like with bedding and white goods and things.\nIs there problems with that stuff? Because when you go mainland, like, when people, family members, or like for beds, and queen [00:01:00] size bed, single beds, yeah. And it's hard for for on the freight, come on the Lucinda barge. Yeah. It's too dear. Too dear. What about like washing machines and fridges and stuff too?\nIs that what you're saying? It's the same thing. Yeah, same thing. Anyone, get some money, they'll go out to town and buy a new washing machine, fridge. Like any white goods, furniture, bed, lounge, dining suite. Everybody goes to Townsville. Like one of the shops. Good guys, Harvey Norman.\nHey, man. But the fright is very, it's very dear. Very dear. And what about, why do you think a good night's sleep is important? Why do you reckon we need a good night's sleep? Ah. We do need rest. Yes. We do. We do. It's for our health. Maintaining health and being.\nAnd we like to, we don't, we can't afford it. Like new mattress. [00:02:00] Yeah. And beds. It's hard. And because of the cost of living for a couple of years. Yeah. That's very hard for locally on Palm Island. Just looking at them, I think they'd be good. We can just take that when we go camping. But they, these collapsed beds, be good when you get Christmas holidays, school holidays, when family coming from the mainland.\nPull it out. There's something there. And kids, they always, Sleep out with family or have to have their friends. Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. And things like this. Yeah. It's really good. And we're getting it for you guys. It saves us money, but people appreciate things like this.\nI think it's a good thing to especially like Christmas coming up and just spend family. Yeah. Be good. Like we always got a [00:03:00] extra, yeah, a bed and a mattress. Yeah. One of the things too is we're making them so they're like you can pack them up so we wash them. Do you think that's a good idea that you can wash, because it's really hard to wash a mattress, right?\nYeah. Oh, easy. It's pretty easy to keep clean. You can wash it. Wash it out, pack it up. Then the next time you have family come over for celebration, or an event on Palm Island, it's an easy thing just to pull out. Then when they go, pack it up. Yeah. It's awesome. Awesome. And yeah, maybe we'll get you to lie down on one too so we can see if you think you're comfortable.\nNo, Lizzie can lie down on one if she can tell us. Lizzie can't do that. Yeah. The granddaughter. Can we get you to be a comfort check? Yeah. Lay it out for us and tell us how comfortable it is, eh? Yeah. Alright, we'll do round two.\n",

Um, back and, um, I was born in England, grew up in Adelaide, but then I've lived in Darwin and Canberra and Sydney and Hong Kong and Darwin again and back to Adelaide and.<�/p> <�p>I used to be a teacher, but I've retired. It's fantastic. That's my, I know. It's so good. How did you first hear about, uh, through an organization that I did some other volunteer work for, and to be honest, I didn't know that this site existed. I drive down Port Road regularly and didn't even know what, what was here, and went on the website and applied and found this.<�/p> <�p>Many, many opportunities to, to volunteer. So, um, and I just thought it was such a wonderful pause. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> Um, has it changed over time, I suppose, your thoughts about Orange Skype? Thoughts about your thoughts about why you're doing this or similar? Yeah, it's had a huge, a huge impact on my perspective of, number one, how grateful I truly am for, for my personal situation and I guess.<�/p> <�p>How to share basic dignities with people. Um, it doesn't take a lot. It's just time. It's just my time. There's nothing else I need to give up to, to do this. And you meet so many wonderful people, not only the, the volunteers. We've got such a great friendship base, um, but you know, the friends of Orange Sky that, that we get to spend time with.<�/p> <�p>So it's, it's really, it's really special actually. Yeah. So, um, I'd love for you to tell me like. What it's like or what this place is like in relation to the people who work as support and service providers and stuff. Like Walk, walk us through where we are and, and what, what this is <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> like. So do you mean these just, just this whole place and the whole, yeah.<�/p> <�p>Okay. It's not quite and peaceful 'cause it's right in the middle of Port Road in literally in the middle of the road. But it's, it's always a. It's always a pleasant place to be. Like you come and there's always a bunch of people hanging around, having some food, having a chat. There's always a cue for the laundry, which is really good.<�/p> <�p>'cause you, you know, you want, that's why we're here. We, we want to do people's laundry. Um, it's a really interesting mix of people. So you get some regulars that you see day in and day out, and then you get. People that, you know, some people who come for a while and then they vanish. Um, it's interesting sometimes when you know, somebody hasn't been for a while who used to always come and everyone's like, oh, are they okay?<�/p> <�p><�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> What's going on? And then you just get people that were just passing through. So you eat. So it's, it's always a pleasant place to be. Like, every time I walk home, I walk home with a smile on my face going, oh yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that's cool. And the people working in the, in the food hub are amazing.<�/p> <�p>Absolutely amazing. Those two in particular, the, the, they're just phenomenal. Yeah. It's a little family unit and, um, I have a sit. What's it like sort of relating to people like Julie and, um, is there a way you approach that in terms of when they first turn up? Or like, how does that feel, I guess, to be able to engage with someone?<�/p> <�p>Uh, I think you, you realize that it's more, more than just having your washing done week to week, which is such a simple thing for you and I to do. In fact, it's a chore <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:05:00]<�/span> that you just loathe and you forget to do it, you know, whatever it may be, but. That they, you know, people come for the company and the genuine connection and that feels that, that's just a lovely, another lovely aspect of of this, I think.<�/p> <�p>And like when Julie first came, she was very quiet and very timid. And now she's completely comfortable and she's joking with people and. You know, it's a, it's a regular thing. Yeah. It's nice just getting people to slowly open up an\n",

      "Transcript": "\\# Allan Mott\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nCool. So you just look at me, don't worry about this thing. Yeah. Um, yeah, can do that. Um, make sure that I'm not confused why it's on. Alright. Rather just tell me your full name and spell it. It's Alan Mott. It's A-L-A-N-M-O-T-T. Tell us a little bit about Alan, Mike, first of all, who's Alan? Alan Mike, probably semi-retired about the Covid days.\n\nUm, I worked for a, a pump company doing, uh, irrigation stuff, sewage pump sets, multi-story building, fire protection system. Did that for 43 years and then when Covid came, things dropped a little bit, so I, um, I was asked to leave with a few other people about the covid time. Um, I'm old enough not to have to work.\n\nUm, and I didn't work for about three months and I'm, [00:01:00] I'm not a, um, I'm not a traveler. I'm not a mechanic. I'm not a shed person. I'm not a gardener. So I found those three months that I didn't work were really tough, um, mental health wise and, um, SA pathology at that time, COVID was at its peak SA pathology were looking for.\n\nPart-time drivers just to run around to all the covid test stations, pick up all the tests, and then take 'em back to the, um, to the, the hospital. So I did that for Covid for probably 12 months. And then after that they asked me did I wanna move across to the pathology side. Um, so I now work for SA Pathology doing the country runs.\n\nI do places like Strath, El Murray Bridge, um, the, the Brossa Valley runs, and I do that 25 hours a week or something along those, the lines. Wow. And, um, it keeps me busy. Yeah. So that's cool. Yeah. Um, how did you hear about initiative? That's a really good question. I'm not even too sure. I, I quite often try [00:02:00] and go back and, and see how that all happened.\n\nI'm going to think it happened on Seek. I reckon that the time that I didn't have a job. Um, I looked on seek for some part-time work just to fill me in and I reckon that may be the volunteering tab on Seek, I think is where it actually came to me. So I think I've, I looked on seek, but I'm not a hundred percent sure about that one.\n\nSo that's how I think that happened. So, yeah. So what, what stood out for, uh, of, about it to, do you remember? Or what do you think stood out for, um, helping people is, is, is a real big part of my life. Um, I really like to do that. Um, I'm the sort of person, um, that would help people in the supermarket and, and, um, can we cut some things out later on?\n\nYeah. It's, it's all just whatever. Alright. Because, because I'd like, I've actually at times paid for people's groceries in line and that sort of stuff. You know, when you look at people who, who can't afford groceries and they struggle Yeah. See you later. And that you know that they're struggling, you know that they're working out.\n\nI can keep this, [00:03:00] I can't keep that, that's gotta go back and that sort of stuff. So quite often, I wouldn't say often, but I've done that before. Um, that's something I like to keep to myself. I don't brag about it. There's some guys on YouTube who pay for people's groceries, but then they film them pay thing and I think that's not what it's for.\n\nYou know, they're, they're doing it to get the clicks on YouTube. And I think that defeats, not defeats, it goes against what the purpose of doing that is. So helping people is pretty cool. That's what I like to do. Um, I do this. Obviously orange sky. Um, I look after, I think there's about 13 sites in Adelaide.\n\nUm, I look after six or seven of them. Um, and Mitch looks after the other ones. Um, when I'm not working, like tonight, I'll just pop up and say hello to everyone, see how it's going, um, help look after the van a little bit. But that's Martin's job predominantly. Um, yeah, but I just like, um, like looking Yeah.\n\nHelping people. So yeah, so that's where it all came from. What's, um, the things that keeps coming you back if you wanting to hang around with orange sky? [00:04:00] Um, the people within Orange Sky themselves, I think we've got some good teams here in Adelaide. We don't live in each other's pocket, um, but I know where they are and I can always pop in a site and say hello.\n\nUm, but these guys here are important to me. Um, now I think that's where, um, a lot of this one's slightly different to the rest of the ones I do. I, I spoke to you this morning about the ones I do at Elizabeth, um, which is run by most of the ones we do here in Adelaide, have some food source attached to them.\n\nSo I just, yeah, it's just nice to talk, be able to talk to people. Um, not that I can offer too much advice, you know, it's not my job to do that. I can't counsel anyone. I'm not allowed, well, I guess we don't do that. I don't do that. Um, but we try and put 'em into areas where they, if they need assistance, where they can go to.\n\nThat sort of stuff. Yeah. So just like, um, meeting these guys, you know, creating a real bit of a, a social relationship with them. A a conversation with people. Yeah. So that's cool. Mm. Um, what do you think the impact of Iron Sky is, um, [00:05:00] across the domains of washing and connection and volunteering you yourself, what do you think is the most important or some of the most important parts of it?\n\nI would like to say that the chat is the most important part. But I'm not too sure if that's the case. I, I think, um, as we spoke today, a lot of people just drop their washing and go sit somewhere else and then come back in an hour and take the washing away. Um, that I, I, I, I think having clean clothes is very important.\n\nI. But I think having the chat is, is the more important thing now. A lot of people live on their own, don't have people to talk to, just come and talk football, talk about whatever they want to talk about. Um, now we've got that Ask Izzy website that we can, um, help people if they need, need assistance and that sort of stuff.\n\nBut it's just a, the, the chat I think is just as important as the clean clothes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, what's your general take on Adelaide in general in terms of struggle or homelessness or whatever? I don't think Adelaide has been hit as hard [00:06:00] as, um, the bigger eastern seaboard states have, and I think that's reflective in the number of vans that we have.\n\nUm, we have one van and that does all of metropolitan area. Um, prior to me starting, I think we had two. And we did a couple of southern areas further down, you know, maybe half an hour outside of the city down south. But I understand a couple of those had no one come to do their washing. So either there's either they weren't, um, advertised enough.\n\nEither it wasn't advertised enough or they just aren't. That sort of people down there. I'm not too sure. So yeah, so, but I don't, A lot of the guys that come to us aren't homeless. Uh, most of the people that have come at Elizabeth. Um, would be, I reckon 90% of them have somewhere to stay. The, the number of people that are homeless that use our facility is fairly small, I think.\n\nI don't think there's too many people here tonight that live on the street. I'm not too sure. I, I don't know. What do you think about this, um, idea of partnering with other service?[00:07:00] \n\nI, I think it's a need. Um. It's the one out at Elizabeth works with Vinnie's. Vinnie's has got a Fred's van where they do a three course meal, very similar to this. Um, there's a food hub where they can come and get food to take away. Yeah. Um, there's a couple of churches that arrive with their vans on a Sunday morning and they've done the, the runaround to the supermarkets and got excess vegetables, excess fruit bread, and they bring that along and we help distribute it.\n\nThat as well. Yeah. So I think, um, I think it's not just the washing, but I think, um, people will come where the food is rather than the washing is. And I think the food attracts us, attracts the people to where we are. I don't dunno too many sites that we actually do, uh, maybe Whitmore Square, where you were, you would've gone Whitmore Square today.\n\nYeah. Um, I think that's probably the only one that there's not a food hub or something aligned with it and that attracts, you know, brings the people in. I think so. Yeah. Um, yeah, you touched on it a little bit, but, um, what do you think the impact is on just people that are, [00:08:00] um, sort of. Um, getting the end of their, um, careers and thinking about other things to do and having to volunteer.\n\nLike what do you think the impact is on some of those people who Yeah. Find this, and I, I look at some of the photos in the, the, the website, not the website, but the magazine, the FFI magazine we put out. And I tend to think Adelaide's probably got a higher, a, a, an older group of volunteers than a lot of the other ones.\n\nUm, probably 'cause I guess there's a bit more transient population in the Eastern states, so people doing university studies and need to, uh, to keep themselves busy, I guess. But just looking at those photos in fro, I think that we probably have a, an older volunteering group, even though there's some young guys here tonight.\n\nSo, yeah. What do you think, what do you think people. Um, find themselves at something like, or inspire as a volunteer, their career just to help people. I think that's what it is. People like myself who have worked all their life. Um, get to a point [00:09:00] now where you're not working and um, what do you do? You know, if, if you, you can only trim your roses so often, you know, and you can only caravan for so often and, you know.\n\nYeah. So that's, that's why I think happens is the volunteering side. And we all come from the age where people helped each other come through. You know, like if your neighbor needed a cup of sugar, you gave 'em a cup of sugar. Yeah. You know, these sort of days. I'm not too sure if that exists, but it does for, for us older guys.\n\nYeah. And do you think there's much sort of effect. Who volunteers who may be struggling themselves, do they find some type of support or service or way in which that helps them as a person in the volunteers? Right. I'm not too sure of too many people that volunteer that, that are in that needy spot. I'm not too sure.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I don't, yeah. Don't have a great answer to that one, so that's good. Yeah. Um, anything that we didn't touch on you thought you think is important in terms of our style? Uh, I think just the whole, whole concept I think is good. Um, Adelaide would like to spread ourselves out a little bit further.\n\n[00:10:00] Um, but also understand we don't have a, a great, um, there's an end to the list of volunteers that we actually have there have come up. Some of our sites struggle for volunteers occasionally. Um, I know that we're trying to look at two new sites that we're about to start. Um, both of those, I think. Won't need the van.\n\nThe van Splash is the only van that we have, which causes a bit of a hiccup. Um, it's on the other side of town. Uh, when I do the Sunday morning shift, the shift itself is three hours, but the shift, by the time you drive to the base, get the van, go to shift, take the van back, it's the seven hour day. Yeah, it's a really long day.\n\nSo we have discussed about, you know, moving the van somewhere more north, but then that disadvantages the people that are on this side of town or that side of town. So there's no real. A place where you can put it, that's gonna make it easy for everyone to get to. But no one complains about it. We just, it just works.\n\nSo, and we don't have, um, we don't have the pods. We don't have the turnover for pods. Um, we've spoken about that a couple of times, [00:11:00] putting them out north. But the, the places where we'd put the pods, I think we'd be looking at probably 10 or 15 washers a week. And I don't think that justifies a. Uh, 20,000, $30,000, whatever it takes to put the pot out there.\n\nAnd I don't think it increased the number of washers by putting the pod there anyways. It'd still be the same 'cause uh, they, people come on the Wednesdays and Sundays when there's food. They're not likely to come on a Tuesday or a Monday to do their own wash. And my understanding of the PO is someone from Orange Sky has to be there to protect it, uh, to, to look after the asset.\n\nAnd I'm not too sure if that we'd find that sort of depth here in Adelaide either. So, yeah, so cool. Such good feedback. Um.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "I'll just ask some questions like an interviewer. Yeah. G'day, Lisa. Hi Ben, how you going? Thanks for taking the time to come to Mackay too. We don't get too many visitors from head office. So this is a video for like, for Brisbane and people just around what the pod is. So give us a little description about what you do, I guess, your role. So my role here, I'm the service leader for Mackay and that includes the two pods we've got. So we've got the first ever pod that Orange Sky put in the world, we like to say. And that's Donny down in Serena. And the second one we have is Jellybean here at Mackay. So I'm always keen to point out that Serena was first. They think that they're our poor second relations type thing, but they are the world leaders when it comes to pods for Orange Sky. Amazing. Tell us a little bit about, I guess, let's go over to the pod and you can sort of walk through a little bit how it works and how we do stuff. Okay, come along. Well, five years ago, we laid this grass. I haven't seen it. All right, we'll move through here. Okay, so this is our pod. What we've got here is washing machines. We'll have three of them down the bottom and we've got dryers. So they're all plumbed in, ready to go. As I say, just like in any other service where our friends come along and they just need to shake out their washing, load the machines. We have our detergent over here. As I said, same as any other normal service for Orange Sky. And so the only thing different is we're permanently here. We're not the van that moves to locations. It's about being fixed in the one location. And what's set up? What does the set up look like for you? So our set up is that we'll come in and bring out our awning. We'll also put out some marquees for shade because up here in the tropics, it's either wet or it's hot and there isn't too much in between. And you'll find even on a late March day like we're here now, with that breeze around, it's pretty hot and humid. So come summertime, we'll actually put backing panels on the marquees to give it a little bit more shade. But at the moment, things have cooled a little to what we've had and they're fine without it. So it certainly makes us loud and proud and visible. And that's probably one of the key things that works for us is that people know we're here and where to find us. How would you describe your role in creating the Orange Sky shifts and like the occasion for them? So as service leader, I think I've probably got one of the best roles that I get to engage not with all the shifts but also with the service providers and the community we have in Mackay. And Mackay is such a giving and caring community. There's a lot of talks I go out to to actually talk about Orange Sky. And it's always pleasing to know that people know about us, not everyone. And they're very generous in their support to come back and the positive feedback we get. And a lot of that is because people are driving past and they'll see us and they'll know, hey, I saw you there. A lot of people know about us. We've got a lot of people here. It looks really good. It looks really vibrant. And we do have a vibrant sessions when people are here. And there's these chairs here that you have conversations in. What's the importance of, I guess, sitting around and having a go at this shift? Look, the chairs are the big thing about our shifts. We all say that, you know, laundry is good for the hygiene. Our service providers bring the food, which is good for people's sustenance. And some of our shifts, they really need it, like on the Monday mornings. But it's that time in between when people get the chance to talk. And that you understand more about that person. And, you know, it just humanises people. But there's also things that we can do to help, that we have support service available, like our partnership here with Vinnie's. You know, it's easy to say, let's go down. Vinnie's will be open at 9 o'clock. What they can do to help you there. And we've got other agencies around. So just having that conversation. And for a lot of our friends, sometimes it's the only conversation that they've had. I've had examples where I've met someone here on Wednesday morning and been speaking to them. I've gone to another volunteering role on Thursday afternoon and saw them down there and had a chat here. Hi, how are you going? And I was really taken aback to say, well, you're the only person that I've spoken to in that whole time. And that was a day, day and a half. And no one had spoken to that person. And they're well known in town. They're not a newcomer or a transient. So I think that just highlights the importance of what we do and why those chairs are there. And that connection. And what would you say if someone's thinking about volunteering and got on the fence a bit? Hey, come down and give it a try. There's no problems coming down, having a look, having a talk to the volunteers. Not just talking to me. I think you talk to any of our volunteers. And we've got a wide range, from uni students right through to 80-year-olds. We actually have our fourth oldest volunteer on the shift here today who proudly claims to be the fourth oldest. So it caters for all types. We have people that work, people with families, people that are single, retirees. There's something there for everybody. And it's also about that connection. I think every one of our volunteers gets something out of it. As much as you think it's a giving role, they'll all walk away with a big smile on their face and think, Hey, that was a good shift. I didn't realise I'd get so much out of it that I do.\n",

Looking at the two sisters and it's just too beautiful, I can't get over it. First time diving here, experiencing it, yeah. Why do you think it's important to tell a story about what this is and who do you think needs to hear this stuff? Our people from Palm Island need to hear what happened and how it did and how it goes and what not. And now try to bring it back and what not. Yeah. Yeah, and what do you hope to do in the future? What's your next steps? What's the next step? I want to try and get into marine biologist. If not, I want to be in the Navy, in the Air Force, mechanic as well. If not my biggest step is being a scientist. Yeah. Cool. And there's this theme of women in water. What do you think is important around having more women and especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women as part of being in the water and science and rangers and all that stuff? I would say to connect with it for the sisters, being in a strong culture with it and yeah, being strong for it. Awesome. And what's next for you? What's the next couple of years hold you think? What are you going to be doing? Probably stay in the ranges for a bit more and then try go ahead to be a marine biologist. Yeah. Sick! Thank you. Deadly. Smart.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "A customer over there just prepaid for two pizzas to bring over. Oh what a legend! From the restaurant so yeah. There's still a few friends over there. So I can do whatever you would like me to do. Yeah they would I reckon. Here you go. I love those random acts of kindness. Let's see how it's looking. I reckon that's not too bad. Cool. I'll probably do bad over there. I always get nervous because I don't edit them. Oh yeah? And then like I get nervous because I give it to the videographers and they're probably sitting there going what a shit frame. Yeah. That's the worst thing ever. The five. Five. Five. I've started editing videos for some gaming stuff online and. Yeah. Oh really? Oh I'm such a novice but when I see something done really well it's always so impressive. Yeah. Yeah you're like god damn. You see something and you're like that has taken you dozens of hours. Yeah. For a 10 minute clip. Yeah especially like transitions like. Oh it blows my mind. Yeah. I always go to this like. I'm going to get really good at everything. Yeah. And then I start thinking about it and doing it. I'm like fuck this. It's like going to the gym. Like I'm going to do it. Got the program. I just need to dedicate some time and you're like I'm just going to watch a documentary about mountain climbing instead. Especially because like you give it to the editor you kind of like it and you think I wish it was this but then you're like oh I couldn't do it. Yeah. Never turns out to be as good as you think it's going to be in your head. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool man. So just tell me your full name and spell it to kick us off. It'd be great. My name is Tom. T-O-M. Robinson. R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N. Cool. Tell us a little bit about yourself first. Who are you? What do you do? Where do you live here? Yeah. So I grew up on the coast and then I moved to Sydney when I was 20. I'm 39 now and I moved back at the beginning of 2020. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm 22 and I enrolled in uni. I'm doing a social work degree and I just had some spare time. And so I was looking for a charity to work for and give some time for and my mum said she'd heard of Orange Sky. She works locally and had seen him in the park so I said give it a go and then I went online and did it. There we go. There we go. Why social work? Is there something that's driving you towards that at the moment? Yeah, yeah, it's a few things. Like I get a, you know, I have a feeling, it makes me feel good to be able to help people. And social work is a way to feel good all the time, maybe, if I'm helping people. And I know there's a lot of, it's not always sunshine and rainbows, as everyone knows, but I think that, I've worked corporate for the majority of my life. You know, I worked in FMCG, you know, in business development and things like that, but ultimately it wasn't kind of filling up that cup of helping people and being a productive member of society. So, massive change for me. Does much translate to what you study, to what you experience as a volunteer actor? Yes, definitely. I think it's an advantage for me to be here, though I didn't come here to have some sort of experience that would benefit me in my studies. I just came here because I had the free time and I wanted to help. But coincidentally, it's really helping a lot. You get to see the sorts of disadvantage that are experienced out there. And, you know, it's a great experience. You know, some like pretty harrowing stories of like people, what they're dealing with and stuff. So, it helps a lot. Yeah. I'm only first year, so, you know. What's the role of Orange Sky within those stories, I guess? And like at what level does Orange Sky help? Yeah. So, Orange Sky is a space holder for me. For people that often don't feel like it. People that don't feel like they're seen. People that need to have a connection. A lot of people live by themselves and they don't get a lot of outward free time. So, Orange Sky is a bastion of connection for these people that are, you know, quite disconnected in a lot of ways. And so, you know, along with the manual labor of the job, which is washing and drying clothes, and the actual role is running around doing work. It's mostly just having chats with people, you know. We'll give it two secs. Although it is real life. It's a riffraff, you know. Bit of a riffraff. It's actually fair. It's like really, really safe here. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah. There's not many places in Australia where like you should be afraid to be, you know. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, so it's awesome like it's in this sort of space. Yeah. With a bit of lighting and a bit of like stuff like this. Yeah. They're like, you know, they do a really good job here, you know. Like, I'm here Mondays and Thursdays. I'm the team leader for this shift. And then the Mondays are like. Making it. I'm just a general volunteer or the driver. And it's way busier on a Monday. Okay. Way busier. There's usually maybe 70, 80 people here. So a lot quieter tonight. But yeah, we're talking about Water Orange Sky, like what their role is and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, we've got people that don't have anything wrong with their washing machine, you know. They just come in. Like, you know, we've got like people that just want to come and have a chat, you know. Hey. Nothing yet, Michelle. I'm sorry. Never reappear now. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm keeping an eye out for it constantly. That's all right. No worries. She lost a jumper. Oh. Nice jumper. Sure. Yeah. And we don't know. I'm. Could have been put in somebody else's basket. But not sure. So we're just asking all the all the other friends that come like, have you seen this jumper? Yeah. It sucks. What's up? Is there things that have changed for you that you've contemplated more or changed perception of or anything that's happened as a part of conversations here or volunteering here? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, one of the perceptions that's changed is just how easy it is for you to find your self in a situation where you need help. You know, some people are like one or two paychecks away from needing, needing a hand, needing someone to help wash their clothes. And um, also how much some people are starved of conversation. And I said before, like 90% of the job is, yeah, 10% of the job is working and 90% of the job is just having chats with people. And that's kind of what it's about. Do you want me to wait for the next one? Sure. Do you want me to wait for these guys to clear out? Yeah. We'll give it a few minutes. Hey, how you doing? Hey man. You want to see the camera? Let's go and see that little red light. See this little thing going up and down? That's the sound. Is it a good sound you think? Green, red? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey man, it won't be long. I'll just go up to the office. Yeah, just wait. Yeah. How many? How many? How many flights? One take, one photo. Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. No, it's not a big deal. It's a good deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How many? How many by one? How many photos does it take? One photo. Oh, no. It's digital, right? So. Thousands. Movies. It's like a movie. Movie? Yeah. Movie. It's like a movie camera. Movie camera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's Amanda. I'm Tom. No, that's not me. So, Amanda. Yeah. We just went through her story. Yeah. Super interesting. What's like... Come on. Yeah. It's going. I need to say goodbye. Oh. Thank you. See you. Bye, Tom. All right. I'll be in the hood next Wednesday. Thanks so much for your time. You're welcome. Hello! Alrighty, oh, okay. You know where I'm at. Ah, brutal. That work? You got my attention. Actually sometimes they say, a mother's a friend. Have a good night everyone. Good night, thank you very much. Good night. See you Michelle. Thank you, mate, for being here again. Thank you. I'll be here on Monday. Yeah, Monday, Monday, Thursdays. I'll be here Thursday for you, because that'll be for our Thursday. Good point. I just wanted to check that. Yeah, I should. Monday starts. Yeah, I'll find out. Thanks for the reminder, actually. Best day of the year, I think. Yeah. Is it what, sorry? It's my birthday. Oi! Happy birthday. It's a solemn day to be born. My mum was born on September 11. Oh, really? Never forget. The only thing I remember is growing up, I was in Cubs, and I always used to get to carry the flag in the index day parade for my birthday. That's cool as hell. Birthday, and you got a flag, and you're a woman. Yeah, I got a flag, and you're in a parade. Yeah? Oh, yeah, everything, all my journeys are one. So, like, Orange Sky. You were saying Amanda. Oh, Amanda, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, Amanda's had this incredible journey, right? Yeah. To get here, and like, she spoke so well around what it felt like to be, like, to use a service, and then to, you know, like, be a volunteer. Yeah. What's that, what's that journey, like, feel like for you, I guess, now you know you've made your way to the world? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm curious if it's the same thing for you, I guess, now you've made it a hand with her, and like, is there a different relationship because she has experienced homelessness, or is she just the same as everyone else? Like, what's your... I didn't actually know her when she was a friend. I've only known her as a colleague. But to see her grow as, like, a person who is in an unstable position to a person who eventually is in a really stable position now has been amazing, you know. It's like a full transition. transformation and you know you can see it on her face like she's got a wild story but she's a very positive happy person um so yeah it's been lovely to have her what's what's the power in that like lived experience it's massive and thinking about what you're studying yeah like how empowering do you think that is to be able to support more people to be part of that industry it's so massive having lived experience for any sort of community work is a superpower people you know you don't want to be divulging you know straight off the rip but having an understanding of what somebody's going through is and is incredibly powerful because you know what they need you know how to hold space for them and how to be how to be a supportive person you know so yeah if you want to do anything in the community you know it's so powerful to have someone that's willing toがんじ Pictures think of them and think it's super inspiring they're like a blessing in the world know the traditional locomotive that you and your old snails you know change up your regularly changed guys community sector I would say get out and volunteer and you know meet the community yeah lived experience is massive for me it's really you know in my studies it's really big it's really good so many diverse people that volunteer for a different reason yeah what do you think from an Australian perspective cultural perspective what's the power what the impact in more people volunteering yeah it's better for everybody because as a volunteer you get a lot out of it you get to make these connections with people meet them get to hear their story they get to hear your story and you feel good and they feel good so it's like two parties just walking away with positivity you know you're not there's a different feeling to it when you're volunteering you know it feels way more pure than getting paid for it because you can leave whenever you want really like you don't have nobody forcing you to come here but you know you want to come like I really enjoy coming here so I think if more people volunteered then they the people they're helping would feel better and they feel better it doesn't take much you know it's only a few hours out of the week for me so it's easy it uh yeah pays more than it pays more like than it takes in terms of karma I guess I always think about like \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ but the services offered what will be the difference if all the people that have worked on it paid for the people for the friends like how do you think that would change the service \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ I don't think it would just change the reasons why people do it people is supposed to overestimate People wouldn't be, I just don't think people would be coming to it for the same reasons. It's not an, you know, it's like two and a half hours out of my week, you know, if they said, do you want me to pay you a wage to come here? I'd feel really weird about taking it. So, yeah, I think that it keeps it, you know, it keeps them more honest if you're just doing it because you like doing it and you want to help people. It's not for profit, you know, like I wouldn't be volunteering if this is like a corporation. You know, they're doing really good stuff. And it seems like all the money is invested in new vans and new services and stuff. So, yeah. Sometimes I hear from friends and they say, kind of like you said before, like volunteers don't have to be here. Yeah. And that's why the friends appreciate the volunteers coming because they're giving up their time. Exactly. And they all know, you know, sometimes they say, oh, like sometimes they ask you, you're getting paid. And you're like, no. And they go, oh, really? And then they like you way more. Yeah. It blows their mind. What do you hope to, I suppose, continue to get out of our own sweat as you're studying? Like are there things that you think will be beneficial and what are those things? There's nothing that I want to gain specifically outside of meeting, but I want to be able to be able to be with new people that come here and maintaining the friendships and relationships I have with people that are already coming here. It's really good for my mental health. You know, I get like anxiety, depression and stuff. And this helps to serve a purpose. And it is a really, just, this makes me feel good. This is really weird. Like, I don't know if it's getting worse or what. But like. Yeah. Anxiety and depression and like different things that are happening in the world that like are creating like this connection maybe or loneliness and stuff. Like. Yeah. Addiction. There's lots of other things. Like what do you think? But yeah, it's interesting to hear you say that. It is. It's a protective factor for you. It is. You know. People with addiction issues. You know, you can easily fall into that cycle. And there's a lot going on in the world at the moment. So, you know, if you're looking out there for reasons to be sad or anxious, like you're going to find heaps of them as well. So I think there's also a lot of people that have probably always had it, but they just never looked at it for what it was. So, you know, sometimes people say, oh, there's so much more people being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, sore throat, depression. So, you know, sometimes people say, oh, there's so much more people being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, sorrow, sadness, depression. And things like that. But I think the reality is that they were always there. They didn't say anything about it. So, yeah, people, you know, they become addicted to things because of that. They're trying to make themselves feel better. And connection is the opposite of addiction. So, like, you know, people come here and get to connect and make them feel better. And they make me feel better, you know. In a weird way, that's like a selfish reason. You're like, I'm trying to feel good. It's like a positive addiction, right? Addiction connection? Maybe. It could be. I definitely didn't come up with that. Oh, yeah? Oh, really? You write that down in my phone. Stolen. Stolen focus. Stolen focus. Stolen focus. Or lost focus. I always take stolen focus. Johan Harari, right? I feel like it's, yeah. I feel like it's a lot of stolen focus. Harari. He went to this beach place and just got rid of all of his devices for three months, I think. Oh, yeah? How'd he go? Yeah, it was an interesting process for him, I think. Like, just the, like, what he gained and what he lost was interesting. Like, I think he gained. He lost a lot of focus and drive and stuff, but he lost some connection and some engagement. But I think he felt, in the end, it was a positive experience. I think it's really good to have those, you know, have that abstinence from technology. And it's hard, but doing hard stuff is good for you. I think that's a big, right? Yeah. It makes you feel, like, you know when you come back from a holiday and you've had to, you know, you're, like, broken out of your routine. You're, like, I've got to go to this place, get a bus, you know, everything's kind of, like, up in the air. And then you come back to your house and you're, like, fuck, I killed this shit. Like, this is easy. Life's so easy. And you've just got this, like, you know, this, like, chill energy about you. Because you had to do all of this wild stuff that's out of your routine and you handled it. And then you come back and you're, like, oh. Yeah. It's a child's play. Routine's so funny and habits. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to, yeah, I'm trying to work out how much to drive that into my children at the moment. How many kids have you got? Two. Two. Yeah. And it's, there's no right or wrong. It's just, like, a continuum of, like, how much you push your kids, right? Yeah. Like, you can push them so hard that you'll, like, do everything, fucking, like, all the carry and, like, over a thousand words. Yeah. How do they, how do they, you know, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the thing that they need to be able to do? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean tell me how they all respond best. How do they do it? Um, they're both a hundred percent really different. Yeah. It's a role in the dice, hey? Genetic lottery. One loves, one loves routine, and loves to sustain in the game, and, like, being told really specific things. And, like, having rules based off drives. Mm. My other one, gives a direction, hates it. Anarsean. Okay, she just loves... What a legend. ...dreaming. She loved looking out the window for 30 minutes. That's sick. And you're always, hurry up, darling. What are you doing, darling? What's going on? And now, especially for the Pollyannas, like hurry up, what are you doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's like, shut up, I'm thinking, Dad. And she writes, like all the time. Oh, really? She's got a typewriter, she types letters. That's cute as hell. That's super cute. I went in the other night. Nice physical memory. And she typed something, and then she rolled it up, and then she tied it in a bow. And I was like, is that like a letter for someone? And she's like, no, it's instructions for something I was doing. And I'm like, it's all weird, but I love it. That's super cute. Is this a scroll from the 1500s? Where does it go now? Yeah. She reads the, she's a perfect drag in the fantasy book. Oh, sick. She reads like one every three days. Oh, what a weapon. And so I've been exploring a lot of the like, those, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All that medieval lore. Hey, are those clothes? Five more minutes. Five more minutes? Yeah, yeah. Sweet. Cool, brother. I reckon that's about it. All right. Thanks, Ben. Unless there was anything else you were keen to say, or talk shit about Nick and Lucius, or? Never met him. Are they?\n",

One's continuous focus and one is, um, static. Okay. It's on static focus. Okay. And you look, you look in focus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker: Sweet. Let's just make sure you're right.\n\nAnyway. All right, brother, you just talk to me, don't worry about the camera. Beautiful. Um, and just tell me your full name and spell it, will you? Awesome. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: Christian Morad, C-H-R-I-S-T-A-N. And Morad is M-O-U-R-A-D. Most people call me Chris.\n\nSpeaker: Chris, tell me a little bit about yourself, Chris. How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man. Thank you so much.\n",

      "Transcript": "Patricia Ann Miller\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThat's where I You got it. You got it.\n\nMaybe I'm a long lost grandson or something. Grandson. Where do I see him? Where do I see him? We got there though. We did too. You know what, I've had a shave. Yeah. So I look why I didn't, I look, I looked 10 years younger.\n\nHey Annie, I'm gonna put this on your shirt. Is that okay? It just goes just clicks like this.\n\nOkay. Ani, I what, how do you spell your full name?\n\nYou want my full name? Yeah. How do you spell your full name? Yeah. Patricia Ann Miller. Yeah, Patricia. P-A-T-R-I-C. J-I-A-M-I-L-O-L. Yeah. I just had you speak was awesome. How do you usually introduce yourself when you talk to people? I get introduced as a traditional owner. And then I've actually got two doctor [00:01:00] doctorates and an AO after my name.\n\nThat was part of the, a buildup of all that I've done over the years. Yeah. Wow. With the community work as well as the legal service. Plus being the deputy administrator here on 20 years worked with six administrators. That was awesome. Amazing. Yeah. And stepped down in 2000 and 2019, I think it was.\n\nYeah. Yeah. What was that period of your life like doing that stuff? Excellent. I really enjoyed it. Met, met a whole lot of dignitaries from like around Australia as well as overseas. Yeah. Met the royal family on a couple of occasions. Prince Charles and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nWow. And but before that I met Pope John Paul the second he come to Alice Springs. Wow. Yeah. And [00:02:00] they, me and 11 others were invited to welcome him. Off the airport. And then they had a big conference down at B Scott Park, which is through the gap. And that's where they hill the church service.\n\nAnd towards the end of his speech to the people, this rolling dust storm and rain came and it was like a godsend from heaven because we hadn't had rain for ages and it poured down. And then we had to go to the airport and see him off in this. Torrential rain. And when I got back to the Presbyter, the Catholic Church one of my wipers wasn't working and was the one on the driver's side.\n\nSo I went to the survey and this young fellow said, oh, you need to have that fix. I said, tell me about it. So he put a wiper on for me. He said, no charge. You're right. Yeah. So things were going my way that day. How do you think you ended up on that journey in life doing that stuff? What was the pathway to doing that for [00:03:00] you?\n\nDo you know? Or was it just a fluke or, no, I think that which path are you talking about? I think just like, how do you explain how you ended up having such a journey in life? What were the things that helped you get there? Or did you actively try, pursue all of these roles and things?\n\nNo, I didn't. People just came knocking and I think was, how I presented myself in the workforce and around town and being, coming from a well-known family as well. Played a bit of sport, representative of the town in hockey and basketball. So I think it's and having friends who were hardworking people.\n\nAnd no sitting around. We all had to work with back in the day when we were growing up, you had no center, Lincoln. No free money. And so if you wanted to buy things, you had to earn it, go to work and earn it. So fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really inspired by Christian, Tanya and all what they're doing.\n\nHow do you see their opportunity to do something that's gonna help [00:04:00] Allison and maybe some other places as well as they grow? I think they're already doing it. There's a, there's already a connection there and the more they spread the word, the stronger they're gonna get. 'cause Chris and I talk on occasions and I said, you need to put your profile out there so that people are aware of what you're doing.\n\nBecause there's also, conflict within town and people suffer terribly from tall Poppy syndrome. And that's a challenge for young women and young men, so unless people can get rid of that sort of bad behavior you've gotta be extra strong to not listen to that type of thing.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Alice brings get a pretty tough, run of the media and a lot of people around Australia wouldn't have a real concept of what the actual situation is here. Yeah. How do you explain Alice at the moment in terms of a, oh look, it happens in every town, bad behavior and people misbehaving and breaking the rules of engagement.\n\nThe other thing is that if you know where you come from, [00:05:00] people can't say why don't you get back to where you come from? If they can't hunt us away from here, you're walking around our country, you are the guest. That's the safeness in that culture.\n\nWhy do you think it's important to turn up to things like this today as yourself and as just amazing to see all the old people here coming up. Why do you think that's important? It's important to show strength. 'cause Bob's our eldest one in the family. Yeah. And we've always been that since we lost our parents.\n\nAnd, but he's always been the leader of the pack, so to speak. Yeah. And he's lived a really good life and, but he's a historian in his own self, there's nothing he doesn't know about the aboriginal groups that live here, and also the white people who are station owners and history.\n\nYeah, I'm working with with Kristy and Tanya at the moment. Is there any. Like you said, getting their profile out there is important. How do you think they do that in the best way, but also the right way? When they're talking about themselves and what they do, and I think they've learned enough now from all [00:06:00] of us to be able to command respect, and and that goes through who they're linked to.\n\nAnd Kristy's she's quite well spoken and she's very strong, but they all are. But because she's working as a, probably seen as the head of in that gives her a lot of, profile as well. For sure. And do you she's also doing some stuff with Li Tepa. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Do you know what that is? She's currently the chair of Lu Tipa now, and there's a bit of ill feeling there because she knows what she's talking about. And they won't have it, or some of the people, but they don't even belong to in they're people from elsewhere.\n\nSo that makes it difficult. Yeah. Super tough. Yeah, I'm fascinated. There's been a lot of talk about the intervention and that'll be a main theme of. Like this few days, I think. What do you think these, what about the intervention or Yeah, what do you think these people need to know to your students about that period of time and when they came in, in, yeah.\n\n2007\\. 2007, yeah. [00:07:00] Yeah. They just threw a blanket over everybody and said, we're putting this taken away the Racial discrimination Act and this is what you're gonna be living by, and that was totally unfair to everybody. There's a lot of good people in this town, and they didn't deserve that sort of treatment, and that made 'em think what are we worth?\n\nBut when that came in, they also took jobs away from people on out stations and communities, and they stripped the council members of their titles, and they were put under general managers, who didn't have a clue what they were doing. And they depended on the Aboriginal workers, but they were just told to sit down and shut up, so to speak, and they removed most of their infrastructure and or sold it or stole it.\n\nSo a lot of bad things were going on while the intervention was seen by others to be really good, it was terrible for the people here. Yeah. Yeah. And what's this? I try and do a lot of work. Young people especially young kids, that they're having a tough time. What do you think [00:08:00] young people need to make sure that they don't fall into their systems that make them worse?\n\nThey need good role models, we've got a couple of young kids that we've got at going to take out Bush to sit down on country and also be with family. Where there's no alcohol or smoking and you go to bed when the sun goes down. You don't wake up at two o'clock in the morning and go and rob people.\n\nThese are the rules that they're gonna be learning 'cause they grow up in the city, so they're coming back. Because the parents dunno what to do. So they put their, hand up and said, can you help us? So that's what we're gonna be doing to them. Yeah. And then you wonder how that scales so that you can help more.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think they just need good people in their lives to show that somebody cares about them. Yeah. So true. Thank you, Arnie. You're welcome. We might do a series. Every time I come, we'll have a sit down. Yeah, [00:09:00] everything changes.\n\n",

      "Transcript": "# Daniel Patrick Noble\n[00:00:00] I did buy a Yarraba team. Yeah! Oh, sure, man. Oh, Yarraba. Sure, man. It was the Yulu, the yellow one. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, because we're from Yarraba. Oh, cool. Yeah, my auntie\nshe's got children to my uncle down here. Yeah. Yeah, so she's been here since high school days. Yeah, yeah. And sorry, just say your full name and spell it, first up. Hello, my name is Daniel Patrick Noble. Hello. D A N I E L P A T R I C K N O B L E. Cool. So you can just look at May, you don't have to worry about this thing.\nYeah, tell us, you just started telling me about yourself anyway, but tell us a bit about yourself. Yeah, I'm just on the island visiting yeah, visiting my auntie from Cairns on holidays. I like to come here often. And yeah, just see family again, all my extended family here on the island. Cool.\nAnd yeah, just enjoy company. And especially seafood as well on the [00:01:00] outer reefs here. Especially the spider shells. That we don't get in Yarraba, where I'm from. Palm Island always feels like home. Because I lived here. I did year five here. I've got a big extended family here. Yeah, every time I'm back visiting.\nI know a lot of people, and a lot of people know me, so it's always like home. That's why I like coming back. Nick and I are trying to work out how to make better goods. Things that are breaking a lot in the community. What are some of the issues you think, Nick? Some of these bedding and washing machines and these type of things in Palm Island.\nWhat are some of the difficulties people have? The difficulties here, compared to where I'm from in Yarraba, we're on the mainland. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Palm Island is surrounded by sea, so their major obstacle is getting it across the ocean to their homelands, into their homes. And that all builds up, the cost of, not only purchasing [00:02:00] it, the cost of having it freighted over as well, it all adds up.\nAnd that's why a lot of, I think that's a big obstacle for the islanders here. When it comes to furnishing their homes. Because it's too hard. Because as with a lot of communities here across North Queensland. A lot of them are low income earners. And just to have that extra cost of bringing it over.\nIt all adds up. And sometimes people would rather just go without. Because they, they wouldn't want to. Be left hanging short on funds. And we've noticed a lot of things breaking over here too. Do you reckon that's like a Is it the goods aren't fit the purpose? Are they just cheap ones? Again with all the costs of freighting, they would rather get something cheaper to cover freighting costs as [00:03:00] well rather than getting something expensive and then Because it all adds up.\nSo why not just get something, say, a 150 bed that would only last maybe a year or two compared to a 500 bed plus freight. That, you're looking at nearly 1, 000 to get that over. It all adds up, so why not stick to the cheaper options, and it doesn't last a lifetime compared to the dearer ones.\nIf that makes sense. So yeah, we've been going for a little bit now. We've tested this stuff out, Calgolian.\nWhat do you think of the general concept, of being out?\nAh for my auntie, she has a lot of visitors. Especially from her hometown in Yarraba. [00:04:00] And sometimes she has to you know, move family around. I'm actually sleeping in my cousin's room, on her bed. who had to move to my uncle's house in order to cater to my needs. So this all comes in handy for when we have family over, especially my auntie.\nAnd so it'll be it's a, it's, I reckon it's a great idea and how it compacts, packs away. And I noticed earlier one of your colleagues there, he was packing it up into a box type Structure Which could actually act as a coffee table in your lounge room when families come over need a place to sleep Dismantle the coffee table and here we go.\nWe have a bed And yeah, you're sitting on it now there's a bunch of different levels of comfort and stuff, but what do you think of the general sort of comfort? I like [00:05:00] firm beds. This is a bit too firm for me. I would definitely go up another layer of cushioning, that's for sure.\nBut, yeah, it's long enough. I'm quite tall. Yeah, this would cater to my needs for sure. We're, yeah, we're doing a lot of doing a learning around cultural protocols and principles and community and stuff. How important do you think that is for us to understand local context and community context?\nOh it's a big one, especially if you haven't been in an indigenous community as anywhere you ask for permission to enter someone's yard or their house. Okay. It's not wise to be in community when we're having sorry business, when someone's passed, especially on the day of the funeral.\nBecause yeah, no one would have time for you because we're all too busy grieving and needing to be elsewhere. But yeah, and it all comes down to common sense and [00:06:00] respect. Yeah. What's the future of goods do you think? What should we do next in terms of like, how do we keep this going I guess?\nIn communities and products and stuff like, or any advice? Say we went to Yarrabah, what Oh, I reckon you should give this a go in Yarraba. See what people think. Because again, we don't have any accommodation there. We don't have any, guest houses. These would be a perfect idea. Because we're all beachside as well, so this could be taken down the beach and used as a seat on the beachside for the day or, again, another bed.\nYeah, it's a great place. Idea and a great concept that could be really versatile in all ways. So cool. Anything else you want to say? Nah, I was glad that you pulled up here because [00:07:00] yeah, we needed more places to sleep. I might have to tell my cousin that she can come back home now because I've got another bed.\nYeah, but yeah, thanks for your time. Thank you, Raz.\n",

      "Transcript": "Alright, you looking at me? See if this looks rad? Look at my hand. Look at my hand here. Are you looking at it? Yeah, I'm looking at your hand. I don't know why. Okay. Can I be up for a duck a little bit? Because I'm only short. Are you looking at me? Yep. What about... Oh, you got that there. No, it's good, it's good. Come across a little bit, behind a bit. Stop. Back a little bit. Stop. Alright. Alright. Alright. Just tell me your name. And your role and where you work. To kick us off. Alright, so my name's Keisha Neville. I'm an Aboriginal health worker practitioner for Healthy Skin. Um... So I work and live in Mount Isa at the moment. Been here for three months. Worked for the Mount Isa Hospital and Health Service. Um... Yeah, so come here on a secondment from up Cape York. In Weipa. And yeah, so... Come up here to try a different experience in a new program called Healthy Skin Project. Um, it links in with rheumatic heart disease. Um...yeah. Cool. Tell us a little bit about rheumatic heart disease and your perception of what it is in the community. Okay. Oh, well this... So rheumatic heart disease is a disease that's been caused a lot of the time from skin infections. Um... Uh, scabies and those infections lead to a strep-ache infection, which causes the valves to leak. And when they have leaky...leaky valves, that's when they have rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Cool. Tell us a little bit about Mount Isa and like the surrounding community. What's your perception of it? And like, are there like things that increase people's levels of risk, I guess, in their lifestyle and their social stuff? Oh, gee. You don't ask easy questions. Um... So... Um...so yeah. Mount Isa has a large population of Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander people. Um...and... Yeah, so the social determinants, I suppose, in health are some of the causes of some of the um...house disparities in... amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So... things like social housing, um... access to healthcare. Sometimes there's stigma there and barriers because of things that happen in their life and stuff through their family going to hospital. So that's where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers and health practitioners and liaisons come into place so they can advocate for the rights and needs of patients. Um... providing cultural support and education and prevention and promotion for clients. Um...also we break down the health literacy for the clients to understand, um... what is being said to them from doctors and nurses to help in prevention and promotion and helping them with their healthcare. Yeah, cool. What's it looking for? What does it feel like, I guess, being out in community and talking to people about it? Like, are they open to it? Is it tough? What's that feeling like for you? Yeah, so... I find working in community is is easy...is a lot better than in a hospital setting. Um...you have... they have the comforts of their home. Um...also you're not just looking at that one person, you're looking at them holistically and also um...their whole family and and stuff like that. Um...because when it comes to some of the infections that we look after, they're very highly contagious and those contagious infections, so they spread like wildfire through, you know, families and stuff like that. So then it's up to us to go in the home, provide that education and that prevention and um...help them with maintaining it to prevent them from getting, like I said, the strep infection causing the rheumatic heart disease or rheumatic fever. What's those um...why's it important to have um... like general health and wellbeing and sanitation and clean clothes and things in relation to rheumatic heart disease? Like why are those things important to people? So those things are important because they keep the germs away and they keep those infections away but also um...sort of explaining that to patients and...oh, Clive, I'm sorry, to clients and stuff like that. They um...sometimes they might have large families and they need help. So yeah, with that we can sort of help them as well. Like we supply some um...laundry powders and disinfectants and stuff but also in linking in with Orange Sky we um...got them to go around to clients' homes and some of the other places that they access in community, so such as Centre Care, they're parked up there and Yolambi and um...Serenity House, they were parked up there and we let the clients know there was free access to washing of clothes and linen and stuff because that helps with the prevention of scabies and those sort of things to prevent them from getting, you know, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Yeah, and you were talking about Orange Sky before you saw them in different places. What do you think overall of Orange Sky, what they do and what's important to the community? So, what I know they were only here for a week and it was a bit of a trial sort of thing like that but um...it was great. They had a successful like turnout and stuff and not only that, they were very friendly and the patients were very content with them and they didn't feel you know, that it was um... there was no stigma with it so which is a main thing one thing we need to make sure that they feel comfortable and you know, everything is culturally appropriate for them and stuff and we worked in with them as well so it was good. Um, they made a the Orange Sky also made a lot of referrals for us for people that had some skin issues and also um... they talked with the clients and found out they were rheumatic heart patients as well and referred them on in case they needed some follow up or check up with that, with the RHD team as well. So yeah. Why do you reckon it's important to have like good interactive skills in community and like be able to be someone that people trust when you're offering these services? Well if you don't have trust you don't have the people and you've got to build that trust as well so you've got to build a rapport, it doesn't just happen like overnight and if they see familiar faces like the Aboriginal health worker or health practitioner out in the community with these uh...other services where they link in and in a collaborative sort of service, it makes people feel welcome and they know that they're safe because they know that other person and then we introduce them and stuff and start building those relationships as well so that they're comfortable and yeah. What do you think the end result is when people are collaborating really well and like politics out and things are built around the client like is that possible do you think and what sort of what does that look like? Well I think it comes to how people like clients and stuff like that they're not going to interact if they don't have a say in their healthcare and it's we should be basing healthcare around the client not us around them like it should be their choice those sort of things and um we help them to empower them to have that knowledge and education and to help their own healthcare. Cool and like what sort of process do you think needs to happen to make sure that people's services collaborate properly and they're there for the right reasons are there things we can do better and how does that look to support clients better when people collaborate in a different way? Well you need to make sure that they have a culturally safe environment um you know like they're comfortable that they have an understanding of what it is that you what it is that you're there for like to provide what sort of care make sure they understand um use open ended questions so um you know so they can elaborate on you know ask them so that they can interpret it back to you so you then know that they do have an understanding cause some people just think cause they can talk and someone nods their head that they understand but not only that that's where health workers and aboriginal and terrestrial health workers and health practitioners and liaisons come into place as well so they can they can read you know a person or and say hey they don't look comfortable and that's where we advocate and stand up for their rights and needs as well Cool is there anything else I missed do you reckon anything you want to say you want to blow about something or get that on camera people that grind I'm a I'm a so I come from um up in the western cape and I worked alongside as a health like as a health practitioner um with chronic kidney disease up there so I I came to this project to learn a lot about um APSGN which is a post strip um infection that attacks the kidneys so with rheumatic heart disease um clients and rheumatic I keep my rheumatic fever they can get bycelin to help them um to prevent further damage to their um heart but when it comes to the kidneys if they've had that um strip infection when they're a child there's you know a great like a really big great chance that those kids will end up on dialysis by the time they're 40 years of age so um I wanted to see how it works with the skin project and those sort of things to help educate prevent and promote healthy skin um to prevent kidney disease as well so yeah Brad that's the main reason why I come\n",

      "Transcript": "all right this is pretty good i think clap my hand sync it up let people know we're here all right so you just talk to me don't worry about this this is pretty like oh actually i'm actually supposed to be sitting on this side have you done this a lot oh i used to do it more than i um more than i do now yeah but um yeah i used to travel around on it a fair bit but i try not to do it as much as possible yeah cool so if you just say your name and spell it for me that's a good start for us yep dina d-e-n-a cool and last name rundle r-u-n-d-l-e cool tell us a bit about yourself first who who are you okay so i'm the social support manager here um i've been here at bigger going on 14 years so i originally started back in the days as a cleaner here um and then i went into a position at the sewn up center as a coordinator and then i came up to social support and i've been here for two years what do you think of like living here i guess like and just explain what it's um playing a picture of what the cow yeah born and bred here um my father's a tour straight islander and my mother's a domestic worker and i mean i've been here for quite a while now two years ago so i've a white lady. Married, I've got seven sons, so I've had two marriages. Just, yeah, it's home. And it's how you make it, you know. It's cool. It's so cool. Tell us a little bit about why you think the work that Bega does is important for this community. What are the things that you see that Bega can help with, I guess? So, Bega is very important for our Indigenous mob out there, for their health, their social wellbeing, everything. We have counsellors here, we've got the medical centre, we have a lot of little programs. Most of a lot of our programs is about educating our mob out there. A lot of our mob fall through the gap. I suppose we're here to be a voice as well for our mob. Just to be a voice for our mob. Just to be a voice for our mob. Just to have that understanding where our mob come from, you know. Things have gone up, which we've noticed. A lot of stuff has gone up. So Aboriginal families here, it's not just mum and dad and two kids, it's a house full. So if you don't understand it, it makes it very harder for you. Yeah, I think it's really hard for people, especially from urban city places, to know what it feels and looks like. Yeah. What's like the, like when you go and actually get to hang out with our community, how does that feel for you in terms of what you can offer? Like, do you feel like you want to do more or do you feel like you're doing enough? What's that sort of process like for you as a local person? It feels like I want to do more. And as Clive explained, we've got to just like, for the future, just to... See where we can put people in that there, because we are growing. It's just like when you're out, you're having conversations, you're yarning, you know, it's not about just sitting behind your desk. It's about getting out there with the mob, having a yarn, you know, like just yarning about anything, I suppose, you know, like, yeah. So important. Like, I've only been here three days, but what I've seen is like people coming together is very... Very important. And it's never in isolation. It's the whole family. It's like kids running around. How do you best support those types of situations and environments where everyone kind of wants to hang out in the same place? So what we do, as you know, we support Church of Christ because we've got a lot of little programs. And as I said, our job is to educate our mob about AOD, you know, mental health, homeless. We've got a lot of homeless here. It's just the best time of getting with mob is sitting around in a group yarning, putting a barbecue on. It just brings the mob in and it's just, yeah, it's just getting out there in the big groups. Cool. That's awesome. It's about this far to come through. No, you're fine. If you just come through, it's all right. Walk on slow way. I know. It was almost like it was like creeping in. See what's going on. Amazing. So tell us a little bit about the first time you heard about Orange Sky, I guess. It'll be a good start. So Clive mentioned it to me like back in the days. And it was something that he was like really interested. He sent all the information, have a look and I was like, yeah, Clive, we need it here. Let's see. And then there was conversation. I think Clive reached out to him and everything. And then as Clive said, a lot of things sort of slowed down a bit with COVID and just things that happened. And then Clive got in contact and then just from there, we just got it going and it's just like, wow. So it was a very exciting day, the day that it was here. It was at Church of Christ. It's just, it's about, it's everything. You know, it's not just about washing the clothes. It's about, you know, it's about, you know, it's about washing the clothes. It's about, you know, it's about washing the clothes. It's about, you know, it's about making people feel in themselves like, you know, you're fresh, your blankets are washed and, you know, a lot of our mob don't have places to wash clothes. We have laundry mats here, but it costs money to put it in. I wish that we could, like the Orange Guy needs to be like every town. We do have a lot of, like Lea and Raya and all that, they all ring through us and say, hey, can I ask you a question? And we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they all ring through us and say, hey, can I ask you a question? And we're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they go, oh, I'm from the Orange Guy, come up here, like, you know. But we've got to just put things in place. Who knows in the future, we could probably get some up there. You know, I've heard they've spoke about they've got like wash machines on little trailers, you know, and everything. But it's about getting out there, engaging with the mob and just while they're washing their clothes, have a yarn. And it could be some mob out there, you know, like they yarn and say, oh, I heard you've got NDIS team there, you know, I want to know a bit more information. And then they'll come back and say, hey, they want to know about NDIS and that's when the NDIS team will reach out. So I think it's so important to be out in the community. Tell us a bit about Phillip, I guess. I've been hanging with him for three days. He seems like a legend. Tell us a bit about him from your perspectives of Phillip. Phillip is unbelievable. Good worker. He's out there. And I think also what helps more with his job is because he's connected out there. Everyone knows him. You know, he's got a nickname. Yeah. You know, like Blackfellow, we've all got nicknames. So sometimes we forget to say the first name. We always say nickname. But he's out there, you know, and seeing, seeing issues out there. It could be something that we could be doing here, you know what I mean? And then he might raise it. I'll talk to Anna, his coordinator, and raise it. And then we can say, okay, so we've got this program over here. So Orange Sky could be out, Boulder Camp, and we could get this program. Because their job is to engage with the community as well. Putting a barbecue on while he's washing the clothes. And we could have other programs there, like interacting and yarning and just, yeah. I would probably do a bad job at this, so I'd love you to help me. Can you tell us about the three locations I've been to? So Church of Christ, Ningamaya, and Boulder Camp? And sort of, can you paint a picture of what that looks like? So when we first got Orange Sky, we was thinking, oh, some locations. So Phillip actually tried some other places where there wasn't sort of people coming in, sort of. So first off, we had to sort of find them right locations. So Church of Christ, as you can know yourself, it's a place where we need to be, to support. Boulder Camp, as you know, they've got no washing machines out there, you know, it could be like for their blankets and everything. Ningamaya is another place. And then we've got our tent and our laundry. And we've got our laundry. And we've got our laundry. And this is sort of what I'm talking about, where we're going to be. And then we've got our So them three places are so important there. I hope in the future, like my another little vision for Orange Sky is that because we have a homeless team here as well, and they actually support people going into houses, Department of Housing, and sort of like support if they get like breach and everything. It could be where there's a big family there, you know, like it could be like a chronic, something happens chronically in the family. So in the future, I would really love Orange Sky to be able to go to based at some of these houses to work along with the homeless team. And, you know, set up and wash their blankets and everything because some of our clients out there in their homes don't have wash machines or they can only afford the tiny ones. So that's in the future. What struck me, it's a very different context from when I go to Ships in the City. And like, fellas are sleeping in tents with big blankets, with mattresses. And this fella came up to me yesterday in Inga Morrow and said he'd been scratching all night. Yeah. What's like the reality, I guess, for some of the community in Orange? Yeah. Yeah. In Boulder and Inga Morrow, I guess, in terms of their belongings. Yeah. And why does Orange Sky, why is it helpful? So I'll just use an example. So there was a family that was in a house, just saying in a house, and the family through the house came through. So we, so then DCP actually got in contact because they support the family. They said, oh, we know you've got Orange Sky there. Because the email sort of like was, yeah. They want to chuck everything away and buy everything. And you know, unfortunately it costs money. Where the family didn't have enough to buy like new blankets and everything. So we had the Orange Sky through the doctor. We've got an environment team here, two blokes. So they would go out to the house and do a bit of education around scabies where, you know, you don't have to chuck your mattress out. You can have them in the sun for three or four hours if you want. If you wash your blankets. And that's where the Orange Sky will come in and wash all their blankets. And you know, things like that, yeah. But even if we do go to, in the future to some houses, the Orange Sky will be so important. Like, especially for some of that stuff, that skin rashes and everything, because, to wash their blankets. Yeah, I got that. That's so cool. Yeah. What's, what's, what's the, what's the way to go about it? Yeah. So we talk about this idea of friends at Orange Sky. So that's terminology for people we support, our friends on the street. And we just released a podcast, The F Word About Friends. What's like, I know it's very different context in terms of that terminology of friends and community and culture. But what does that word spark for you, I guess, in terms of what you do, what Orange Sky does and that connection that people have at these services? Like, is that a relatable terminology or would you use a different term for that? Yeah. I think it's a really good term for what's happening, I guess, in terms of that connection piece. Like, would you use a different terminology of like, is it more community? Is it like connections? Is it, what's actually happening, I guess? Community. And community and connections as well. Orange Sky, it's out there. Everyone knows about it. Like, it's just out there. But mostly from the community. And, yeah. Your connections. That's cool. And like, we always talk about conversation, right? Like, I've been around, there's been so many yarns spinning around. What's that, is that a meaningful part of what Orange Sky, like, happens at these shifts? Like, how important is it to sit down and have a place to have a conversation, I guess? Yeah. So, look, I actually do get a lot of phone calls, as I said, from other communities about the Orange Sky. But you just, oh. Yeah. It's just, you just, it's bigger. If that makes, yeah, it makes sense. It's bigger. But you get so much out of it. I just don't know how, I don't know how to explain it. But you know what I mean? Like, Orange Sky, it is. It's about people's dignity. It's about your hygiene, you name it, everything. If you've got that, you feel so good in yourself, you know? You know, I know what it's like. You know, I've been out bush for like a week. I mean, I don't know how to shower for like three days. And you're like, ah, I can't handle this here. It does. It just makes you feel like no good. Then you get grumpy and everything. But just to know, I think out there people know the certain places where they can go. If that made sense. It's awesome. Yeah, yeah. Last little question. I can see from your, like, personality and your approach, you're a big visionary, a big thinker. I am, yeah. What's your big vision, I guess, for the next five, ten years in this place? If you can, like, yeah. I just visualise that we could actually have an Orange Sky in every little town. You know, it might have to be, it could be, it all depends on the size of the town, I suppose. Oh, gosh, I could just say so much. But I'm a big visualised person. I'm a big visualised person for the future. You know, the world, I don't say society is changing. I say the world is changing. You know, ever since we had COVID, it changed a lot of people's living ways as well. Unfortunately, we couldn't even, like, isolate people. Do you know what I mean? Like, separate. We had to sort of work with the whole families. But that's, we didn't have Orange Sky at the time. But yeah, I'm a, I like to think of the future. Yeah. And I know that, like, we're growing. I just like, we could just do so much. So good. That's amazing. Was there anything else that you wanted to say or something we didn't catch or like anything? No, just... Or a message for Jude? No. Jude, she's unbelievable. She's an amazing lady. Just like, she gets straight to the point. And I love mob that get straight to the point, not beating around straight to the point. She's a great woman. She's very kind. She's always there. You know, she's a good person. She's a good person. She's a good person. And she's a good person. And she's a good person. And she's a good person. Yeah. around straight to the point. Very supportive. So I have noticed like I know the orange guy needed to get a bit of maintenance done one time with the battery and it was like I walked at the front there and it was just like bang the people was here to fix the battery and I'm like they're faster than the um what is it RAC mob they're faster than them but it's just like straight on it straight on very supportive. I hope especially um because we're growing I hope that we also we're going to be looking at and I think Judith's aware of this here looking at training up some other staff as well to manage the orange sky and hopefully down the track we can also look at some volunteers that can jump on like you know at Church of Christ like when Tracey was talking about Steve in there um Kai but you know it could be where they just go out to with Phillip support because your own mob is helping your own mob so that's the best thing about it yeah so good all right you're gonna take me for a bit of a tour yeah okay\n",

      "Transcript": "# Paul and Tig\n[00:00:00]\nNo, I was here on Monday. Here on Monday. Oh, okay. So probably all Canberra ones. Yeah. Okay. We ready? Yes. Paul Super Cash. First of all, foremost, your full name and spell it for me. Yep. My name is Tig Hall, T-I-G-H-A-L-L. Cool. And Paul Miller. P-A-U-L-M-I-L-L-E-R.\nI am the queen being clown, I suppose. I work for CDC Transport, which is working with disabled kids, taking 'em to and from school, and I hang around here when I'm not at work, you know. I joined Orange Sky about eight years ago, I think.\nHad been a public servant and now happily retired. So I spend my Wednesdays hanging out with Paul and all our friends. I think I just came here one day. And the van was here, or was it? No, down at We were down in town. Yeah. And they had that, 'cause that's when the first one that had the showers and.\nThere was lunch available? Yeah, so it's that partnering with an [00:01:00] organization which offers additional services. So we, we would meet people while they would go in and have lunch, and now we meet people while they go in and have breakfast. So it gets even better. Yeah. Annie's doesn't mean breakfast doesn't.\nNo, don't they? Yes. They, Annie's has nice breakfast and ke did you first hear about Orange Guy? Well, I'd been I was contemplating taking taking a redundancy at work and on the day before I did, I was. Allowed to leave. I saw the van, which had obviously been up at Old Parliament House doing the actually new parliament house doing where the boys got their Australia Day award.\nAnd I thought, oh, I love doing laundry and I love meeting people, so maybe I could do that as a way of keeping occupied and I've loved it.\nWell, I do my washing here when I can, but I've been here eight years. I've dressed up as Santa Claus. As I said, I'm the queen being clown, so, yeah, it is exactly. And it really is. I mean, you [00:02:00] stop in more to chat than you do really laundry these days. And I'd say most people here are probably more for the conversation 'cause it's such a.\nConvivial atmosphere and it is really a a community with, with everyone. So those, we get, you know, maybe 6, 6, 8 that need to do laundry. And then the rest are just drop-ins to have a chat, tell us what they've been up to, what mischief they've been up to see what to trouble they've been into this week.\nAnd the good news, the bad news, we hear it all. Eight years is a long time to be hanging. Why do you still hang around? Like it's a, it's a significant like, come commitment. What's, what's your reason for this life? I just, as I said, in between work, I just come in, have breakfast talk to see what's happening.\nI volunteer for Salvos in Queenbean as well when I'm not here. So, yeah, it really, yeah, it really is a way to connect. And the thing is, it's, it's, [00:03:00] when we talk about our friends, it really is about friendship. And over eight years, I, I see Paul just as much, if not more than, than friends I've gone to school with and hang out with.\nAnd so we know the ins and outs of each other's lives and it's really nice. It's really nice. So some people you meet for years and then some for a couple of weeks. So, and here's another one. Hey, that's Alan. How Alan, what's going on a good day.\nI'm trying not to be suspicious. Am I not doing a good job? Put me in. Alan rarely does laundry, but again, he's always here. I met him, one of the first people I met all around. He's another one of our little trouble makers. Wash, but they won't wash it. He won't fit in the washing machine. I've tried to put him in, but another one, they won wash me birthday too.\nYeah, he [00:04:00] brings the dad jokes. Alan brings the dad jokes, don't you? The down, been trying to bring your wife down, but she's not comfort. Yeah. So you, yes, you bring doers, big doers and things, but otherwise you've been, you've been around since I started as well. Walking around an old Yes. I don't know, boy.\nAround, around and, and route. So why do you like Orange sky, Alan? Huh? Why do you like orange sky? Why do you like orange sky? I. It is a congenial companionship of the ladies that love it. Ladies, Barry's here today. He might get upset now. They call him, they call him Gertrude. They call him Ger for short and leave off the rude part.\nYeah, well, there you go. Yeah. Oh, this is. A I, yeah, he watch out the, watch [00:05:00] out, the pictures that he takes, and then watch the hour afterwards. You seen the, I I took some photos up in point or whatever they used to. Yeah. And a couple of the ones are still photos. They've used this animation thing on it, and, but the, the daughter stand there with a wife, with his wife, and that was a phone that was a picture, but then all of a sudden.\nI thought goes, goes, oh, it's weird. So what was this for? Just, just changed it. Automatic. Oh. So we get all the stories. We get all the stories. I didn't do it. They, it was done automatic, apparently. Well, that was what I looked at, said I don't remember taking a movie.\nI'm surprised. I'm surprised Elaine hasn't run down here yet. Wow, we haven't seen her today, have we? Maybe she's got time off, so. Yes. And what's the what are you most looking forward to over the next, well, it's been eight years now. What's [00:06:00] next for Orange Sky for this and whatever do you think? Is it just the same old or you intubating?\nWhat's, what's the goal? Well, hopefully they're going to put orange sky, the sleep bus down near the park, near the police station. 'cause we've got a sleep bus that comes in seven days a week. That four or five people that's gotten off the ground, hasn't it? Yeah, four or five people use it every night and whatever it is, they're taking it off, you know?\nSo that's cool. So hopefully we'll have a sleep. The orange sky there too now, so they'll be able to sleep in the bus, wash their clothes, but I think as long as they need, they saw the movie on Sky. You weren't in it. The movie. Orange Sky? Yeah. Called Orange Sky. Well, I dunno, not familiar. Not familiar.\nHe's he's, he's another clown of queen. They're all clowns. They're all clowns. Me. You're not familiar. Always familiar with me.\nAlright. Thank you so much. You're [00:07:00] welcome. \n",

      "Transcript": "Good night. I reckon that's as crispy as it's going to get. I think it's going to get much better than that. Sounds good. Alright brother, just your full name and spell it will be awesome. Yep, Samuel Thornberry. S-A-M-U-E-L-T-H-O-R-N-B-U-R-Y. Cool man. How did you first hear about Orange Sky? I think I came across, I was looking at volunteering opportunities and something popped up on my Instagram. And just had a dig in, had a scroll through the service. Yeah, it was something I really wanted to give it a crack. Was there something rad about it, something specific, or was it just the vibe in general? I think it's the vibe. I like the idea of, it's such a simple idea but really powerful. Giving dignity to people. Something like, you wouldn't even think, you think of traditionally someone living on the street, like a friend's food and drink. But like, I don't know, just having clean clothes is something I would never even, I don't know, ever thought of. And I just thought that was, yeah, something really special. So, yeah. What's, for someone who hasn't been to an Orange Sky shift, what's it like? What do you do? Yeah, it's great, great experience. You rock up, have a bit of a chat with the other volunteers. Get set up, you know, put out your chairs and all that, start up your dryers. Usually have a couple of friends come for a chat. Explain the service to them, load up their washing. Yeah, it's just building that connection with the friends, which is always good fun. So. What's, did you have a very special experience with the volunteers? Did you have a particular idea of homelessness before you started? And has it sort of changed since you volunteered? Sorry, the... Has it changed since you volunteered, I guess, your perceptions of homelessness? Yeah, definitely. I think you don't realise how widespread it is. Like, it affects people from sort of all different walks of life. I think especially like more recently, like the cost of living crisis and stuff, you start to see a lot more like young families, older people as well. And that's been like, yeah, a little bit shocking almost to me. Something that I don't know. Yeah, wouldn't expect, so. Cool. Yeah. This is good lighting. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yeah. A lot of people just ask, like, how can you bring out you two volunteering or something like that. And I was really interested in just, when they hear about the whole concept of the little van and stuff with the washing machines in the back. They're always pretty like mind-blown. They always think it's a great idea. And then they always express like a bit of an interest and one's getting involved as well themselves. Yeah. So that's always been really good. It's some really interesting conversations. And yeah, like kind of what you were talking about before. Like a lot of them are very interested in the types of people that you get or who are using the service. Yeah, and it's good. So it's good to get exposure to that. And like, what are your thoughts on the public service process? Yeah. get exposure to that. And like characters I guess from all walks of life and different backgrounds and stuff? Yeah. How do you feel like with the different types of people that you've brought up? Yeah absolutely you get some um also it's like we get some older people that people have been farmers people in the military um just people have always been sort of from rougher parts of life um you also get people like professionals tradies literally everyone like this whole segment so it is really interesting you have some really good conversations um and you get a lot of exposure stuff yeah people you might not normally interact with day to day which is really good. Cool and what's like um what's the connection between what you do like professionally and your identity to this is their attention is it totally different is it like an escape what's the what's the vibe for you? Yeah a bit of an escape like I work I'm an office job so I'm in IT um and so that kind of you know working behind a desk you're not you're not really interacting with a lot of people day to day I'm a bit of a keyboard warrior so so um yeah come on and see me. Something like this it's just great like be able to build people skills get to chat to them um I really like that human connection something always we're really drawn to so Orange Sky I think is a very personal service you're getting to interact with your friends the whole time um I really like that. Can you say anything about your new podcast? Um Orange Sky just recently finished this podcast it's called um The F Word so um yeah as you know it's like the terminology we use for um Oh is that right? Um I was recently listening to something by you know Simon Sinek who's like a motivational speaker columnist he's got a new book coming out on friendship and it's all about like the it's like one of the largest sort of influences on health outcomes and mental health what do you feel about friendship as a whole in terms of not just what Orange Sky does but like like holistically people's like lives and like and do you feel that in your own life too I guess with friends? Yeah like just what the vibe is of friendship from generally yeah I think um it's probably like one of the most important things you can have in your life um your mates are there for you um and the good times and the bad um I think until you go through a bad time sometimes you don't realise how important it is to have a really strong support network um and just having mates you can rely on it can be a real rock and it's really valuable so yeah. And what's the translation you think with uh with Orange Sky calling friends when they can't play house and that's what you're trying to find? Yeah. Yeah I think um some of the people you come like yeah like one of the comments always really struck me um one of the first weeks volunteering was someone was talking about having a bit of a chat like a lot of people ignore him when he's on the street um it doesn't feel very sane and he was talking about how he just yeah like empowered the dignity and um just felt a bit more humanised having been able to have a chat with us um and yeah that felt really special I don't know just you don't even picture like I feel like it can be normal sometimes when you're walking down the street sometimes you just turn the other way or um and that was just yeah it felt really special. Yeah. Yeah it felt really special being able to yeah have that chat and build a relationship over time so. What's um what do you sort of is there a thing in which you hope sort of happens in the homelessness sector homeless as well and if you're homeless is there like do you have this dream of everyone being housed or is it more just like getting a bit of dignity where do you have it get to in the next little while? Um I'd want people to get a dress before they fall through the cracks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've had a couple of days where I've had a lot of mental health experience because I've been in the tracks a lot um I see a lot of people who come through and I think a lot of it like you sometimes you notice some friends their mental health can sort of deteriorate over the time you interact with them like say over the course of a year and I just wish like there'd be some more intervention and get them the help they need earlier on um before they you know end up sleeping rough um and that exposes them. That's your final spotlight. But uh say something really profound now because that'll be. Oh you missed it. Ah. I like a lot. Cool, man. Yeah, was there anything else we didn't touch on that you wanted to say? Yeah, just love the service. I think it's such a great idea. And, yeah, I really hope it keeps growing in Perth. And, yeah, it does a lot of good. I reckon they're big enough, Nick. I don't know.\n",

      "Transcript": "\"text\": \" So, this is... Am I standing good? Yeah, amazing. Oh, maybe turn tiny bit, because you're going to speak to me. Oh, yeah. It's a great thing. Cool. Start with your full name and spell it for me. Okay, yeah. My name is Allison Paley, A-L-L-I-S-O-N, P as in Peter, A-L-E-Y. Amazing. Tell us a little, like you always start with like, where you want to start, and I guess it could be where you're from, your identity, or something like that. Okay. Yeah, so I'm American, raised and born in Washington, D.C., and I came to Australia about 20 years ago. I'm a really proud Australian citizen now, also a proud mother to Aboriginal children. I'm a marine scientist and lecturer and really, really passionate about working with young people in experiential field settings outside of the classroom. Tell us first and foremost a little bit about this relationship that you have with Palm Island and the languages or what that's like to set up here. Yeah, so at JCU, the university I work at, I'm the coordinator of a program called AT-SIMS, which stands for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Marine Science, Marine Science Program. And we have a long history of connection with the Mumbra Elders Council and now the newly formed Minga Minga Rangers. They provide opportunity to engage with our young people when we bring them on country out to Guburi or Orpheus Island. So they're there to welcome them to their country, they're there to spend time with the young people, sharing stories, sharing advice and to participate in the activities we do in the ocean alongside them as well. Tell us a bit today what's your take on it and what do you think is special about it? So today we're visiting a site that has great cultural significance to the Mumbra people and to some of my colleagues and friends that I've worked with for a number of years. And the site has an important story that's connected with it that's part of the local people's dreaming and so we're here to see a site that they call the three sisters and it's a it's a women's site so it's only a place for women to be so we're here on a boat full of women out to visit this site and to collect some evidence of the site, photos, photography, stories that we can share and that the Mumbra people can use however they see fit. What's your take on this para storytelling, especially in the cultural context? How do you think that can be better utilized across a bunch of different families of people yeah storytelling is so important i think for being able to convey the facts about something with the emotional connection to it as well and sometimes that gets lost on paper with you or KPIs or statements. And that's the power of stories. That's the power of the visual and videos is that it can unite all of that together. And I think that's exactly the kind of education that I enjoy, too. You can teach students facts and theories, but unless you're actually showing them it physically, the two marry up so well and become so incredibly impactful. teach students facts and theories, but unless you're actually showing them it physically, you know, the two marry up so well and become so incredibly impactful. And I think that's the same with storytelling. As a non-Indigenous person, and like a connected Indigenous cultural person, what's your sort of frame of reference around the process of listening and your role in that? How do you feel about that opportunity to sit and listen? Is there a way that you go about that? Yeah, listening is a really important skill to have. It's great to be outgoing and to be extroverted, which I typically am, and to talk and to share, but it's equally as important to learn when to just sit back and listen and observe and you know my friendship with Richard and the elders has really highlighted that they always have these beautiful stories to share and I find myself as I listen to Richard constantly jotting down his sayings because the way he speaks and the way he shares his hopes and dreams and aspirations for his people is sometimes so poetic. And, yeah, I have pages, pages scrolled down of Richard's sayings. And I don't know where I would be without some of that to, like, reflect back on. Yeah, I think it's just as important as sharing who you are, which in my culture, Americans are very good at that. We're very good at sharing who we are and projecting outward. And I think that, you know, it's taken a long time to make sure I'm receiving that just the same from other people and allowing them the chance to do that. This race, Women in Water, is kind of, sounds rad and is rad. And it's like, yeah, it's a super interesting concept. What's your take on what that really means in action? I mean, I have been lucky to be a woman in water for many years now. And I have to say that when I'm on field trips where it's a woman-only team, we certainly feel, like, powerful. We feel empowered. We feel like we're in charge and running the show and we don't need anybody to do anything for us. And, you know, when you think about in the water you're thinking about boats you're thinking about tools you're thinking about other kinds of skills that may be more traditionally male aligned um and so you know being a woman in the water in that industry and you know feeling empowered and being able to share that with up-and-coming young women i think is really. It's really important too. I always like to end on a little bit of like, what's the future? What do you think the impact is? So tell us a little bit about that from today. Maybe what comes next and what your hopes and dreams connect with what's happening. What comes next from this collaboration today? 100%. Yeah. I think this has been a really important sort of starting point. We've had a long history together and a lot of us know each other and are comfortable with each other, but there's nothing like working together on a project to kind of really accelerate those connections. And, you know, this is a big piece to a puzzle that the Mumba people are working on and being able to be a part of that puzzle and help them and giving our time and supporting them in whatever ways that we can meaningfully contribute I think is going to now be its own launching point for some you know deeper connection deeper collaboration and project work moving forward for the Mumbra people, yeah, I hope that, you know, their new female rangers and their trainee female rangers are gonna, you know, stay the long course and become a huge integral part of the Indigenous Land and Sea Ranger groups and, you know, that's something that we're pushing for industry-wide is having more women on country and I know that the men in the group feel just as strongly about that as the women do, so it's really rad to be out here with all of the female power. So good. I was going to ask you another question but you answered it. Oh, okay. Well there you go.\",\n",

      "Transcript": "Oh, yeah. We'll just chop and change anyway. Yeah. Hey, how are you? Hello. How's it going? Track pants? Oh, track pants are for gentlemen at the front. Oh, yeah, just at the front desk and in the computer room. Where the computers are in the big room at the front, there's some boxes with clothes. Shall I take? Yeah. Let me show you where they are. I remember meeting you last time. Okay, let's find your clothes. Okay. Hello, my name's Rita, R-I-T-A, and I'm a team leader and service coordinator for Trambi here in Perth. So just the track pants. And we're pretty busy at the moment, so I keep going a bit. This way. I think it's just in here. Yeah, we've been here for about seven years. First with the van, which has always been very, very busy. Then Trambi, Uniting WA, our service provider here, actually did a big renovation of the premises, and we're now able to actually use the... the internal laundry, which is fantastic. So very busy most of the time. I hope you don't mind, but I just got to keep doing things. Hey, Santina. There you go. Pretty good. Let me see. Hey, baby Wangle. Do you need anything for the showers? Hey. Put some of your stuff here. Hey. Oh, good. Yeah. They're all to be dried, still. Can I put these outside? I don't think so because it's... I guess it's probably too wet. ...it's raining a bit, isn't it? Yeah. Okay, we've got Melissa and Lux is going in the dryer. Cool. Okay, that's good. So this is Min over here. Hi. M-I-N. Yes, nice and short. So we started about 35 minutes ago and we basically have a pretty full afternoon again, but that's great. The difference here for Trambi is that we're doing the shift with two people because of the area restrictions. There's not that much space in here, but it works perfect. And we have a wash list as well. So people can, at the beginning when they come in at the reception of the center here, put their name down. So that works really well because it just gets too busy for us otherwise. So that's good. Tell us a bit more about Trambi. Like, is it the most Trambi? Yeah, Trambi is the most Trambi. Trambi is the most Trambi. Trambi is a, this is the Trambi hub. It's a complete service for the homeless. It provides Centrelink, street doctors, short back and sides. We are here five days a week, as I said, and we hope to be here every day of the week because we've got plenty of volunteers. So that's good. Hello. Did you get a towel? I was sitting in the angle. Do you want to be in it? I don't know. You can. You're allowed to. You're allowed to be. Why do you keep coming back to volunteer? What's the story about you? I think it's fantastic to give something back to people who are less fortunate than we are. I go home to a warm house. And I'm like, I'm going to do this. And these people here, these are really people who need all the help they can get. There's most people here that come to Trambi are rough sleepers. And it's winter. It's cold. It's just, yeah, we need to do something, don't we, to help. What's the, we talk about the word friends a lot. What does that word mean to you in terms of what you do on this tour? I don't know. I don't know. These people really mean something to us. Hello. What's your name? Hi. How are you? Good. Hello. How are you? They become friends. They, they in the beginning, maybe only acquaintances and they come in and out occasionally. But we really building up some rapport with them. And we've got some amazing stories where people finally after months and months, you know, do get some temporary accommodation. Yeah. And then move to better things. But we also have had some very sad situations where people unfortunately take their own lives. And that's been pretty traumatic. But we've got great support here. And, you know, that is unfortunately part of homelessness, isn't it? It's really, really sad. So, you know, hearing happy stories is, it's just amazing. Only last week, it was just fantastic. We, we've had a homeless person here. And fortunately, he found work again after many, many months. And it's now doing fly in, fly out. It's living in a share house. And he ended up on television because he was helping his landlord in the backyard doing some maintenance. And they were actually replacing a sewer system or something like that. And unfortunately, he got stuck in this big hole. So, it was all over Channel 7. We had, you know, the helicopter above. And I straightaway knew it was, it was him because he lives now in the area where I live. And he told me where he was. And I just had this feeling that it was him. But everything was fine. And he came in a few days later to actually tell me what had happened and to also again thank us for that. And thank us for what we've been doing for him over the, over the past month. So, that was just, that was just really lovely. Really nice. Yeah. Okay. I need to get this. What do you think it takes to be an Orange Sky volunteer? Is it a special skill or what is it? No. I think you need to be open-minded. Don't, what do you think, Min? What does it need to be an Orange Sky? Hello, I'm Remley. I'm pretty good. Hello. How are you? Pretty good. Well, pretty much. We can have a look a little bit later if we can still fit you in. Yeah. But. Yeah. I've got to wash it. Yeah. Yeah. What's the time now? I want a bra. What about tomorrow? Are you here tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. If you come early. Yeah. Then, you know, get. I definitely will. Yeah. Yeah. Get your name on the list at 7. All right. And then we can do it definitely. All right. Cool. Well, I'll check in. See you. But are you having food as well now? Because we can check. Oh, I've got a really good idea. Okay. Can you find the one on that? One. Okay. Now, next, we have our little list again. So, we're doing good. Min. Yes. Teresa not here. She's not here. No. She's not here. Yeah. She's not here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Teresa not here. No. No. No, Teresa and no Christo. Oh. Okay. Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Okay. So, then we can do. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okey-dokey. Still orange sky liquid. We just decanted a bit. Okay. That's fine. Okay. Oh, just those ones? Just a pair of my knees. We should be able to fit those in. Are they yours? We can put them in here and then we can check if you can put it in with somebody else. Okay. Okay. What was that? David Jones. David Jones? Yeah. Okay. I'll check if I can put it in with Matt. Normally we never wash together, of course. We only, if the friends agree, and I know David Jones knows Matt. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. I think that's his name. Apparently. But we know him as such. Hi. That's really funny. Yeah. Call him DJ. Matt. Amy, when did you start volunteering? I have lived and worked in the city and I just saw, I guess, timelessness was on the, you know, rapidly increasing and I just wanted to do something to help. And Orange Sky really helped me. Yeah. And Orange Sky really resonated to me. I looked up various organisations, looked at Orange Sky's website. I thought it was very informative, really like the mission, the founders. That's just seemed really progressive. And it wasn't because it's not affiliated with any, you know, religion or politics. So I'm bored. And I guess my own sake as well, like I'm in the corporate world. It's not, you know, fulfilling. I help businesses. But it's just nice to be able to help people. So yeah, I'm loving it. It's very, it's fun as well. I didn't think, I didn't know what to expect, but I love it. And yeah, I just want to do, I just want to keep doing it. Yeah. I love meeting everyone. What's it been like? How long has it been, sorry? So this is my second shift. And I guess every day, Rita's been a fantastic trainer. And it's really, and it's really, yeah. I'm glad you're here. And it's really inspiring to see Rita's connection and relationship with, you know, the staff here, but also the friends. And yeah, I've personally loved meeting everyone. It's very humbling, you know, and putting my own, I guess, ego aside and just realizing this can happen to anyone as well. So. So I'm ready to find you. Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Yeah, no worries. It'll be cool. Yeah. Awesome. So good. So, yeah, you told me that this podcast was just released for the F word, friends. Okay. How do you relate to that word as opposed to like in terms of what you do here and then your, like, friend as well, your own friend? Yeah, that's a great question. So what does friends mean? I guess equal to me. That's the first thing that comes to mind. What else? Sorry, I can't think off the top of my head. What does like friendship to you, what does it mean to friends? Right. Okay. Would be no judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. No judgment. Just care for each other, respect each other, and as cliche as it sounds, treat each other how you like to be treated. And, you know, when they're in a difficult place that I like to help them and when I'm in a difficult place, I'll feel like, you know, they can help me as well. You sound like an amazing Orange Sky ambassador from, like, but you're known as being awesome, right? What would you say to other people who are thinking about volunteering but are not sure of themselves? I would say just give it a go. I guess even if you just wanted to do one shift, there's no, you know, need to commit. You can just see how it goes and, yeah, there's no pressure. You can, it's flexible in terms of, you know, the dates and your, how often you do it as well. So there's just no harm in giving it a go. So, yeah. How do you find the conversations and hanging out with your friends and stuff? What's your, how does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do this, you know, I'm going to do that. How do you find that? How does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do that? How does that feel to have someone say, you know, I'm going to do that? Hey, how are you? Just really interesting. It's just really interesting and it's just nice to have really frank conversations and I guess there's no, it's not, it's no small talk. You just kind of get into it and it's just like, yeah, no filter. Love it. Yeah. I'm not trying to be all, you know, professional or anything like that. You just, who you are and it's refreshing. Are you guys crack on? Yeah, yeah, that's true. Oh gosh. I reckon about eight, 10. Yeah. You don't need toiletries? There's a lot. I actually do more washing here than I do at home. No, you're good. My partner said I could learn a thing or two here. We've got, we've got a friend from Orange Island here. Yeah, keep hustling away. Sure. Doing a little documentary on volunteering here. You're right. Waiting for a shower. Yeah. Okay. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah. And you've got the door open. Yeah, okay. And you've got the toiletries here. This is Ben. Matthew. Oh, I miss Matthew. Matthew. Do you want to be in it? Or not? No, you don't have to. No, I don't know. My dish is not, it's not good. I'll interview the... He tells me all his secrets, but you know. Oh, come on. Is it, has it got power? Yeah. Yeah. It's good, isn't it? It's good. Okay. So tell me, you have not been watching a soccer then? Well, okay. Well, if you're, when you're in the shower... The Euro. You're going to leave your... Yeah. Did you watch the Euro? Do you want to leave that here and I can watch it for you? The Euro soccer? With France and Belgium and Italy. Yeah. It's too late. It's midnight. I was really, really early. Well, look at my eyes. I was up all night watching Holland, my country. And we won. Yeah. Oh, really? We're in the semis now against England. That's going to be... We beat Turkey. Oh. Oh, my God. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry.

      "Transcript": "Sound and so the idea is you look straight at me. Yep. Don't worry about this bizzo. Yep. I'm kind of your key audience, key target audience. Yep. Your mic's going good and frame is pretty good. Shame. I'm just trying to get in the shot. Okay. Cool. Cool. So it's pretty casual just talking. Yep. I'd love for you just to sort of tell us a bit about yourself. Yep. And your role. Like how long you've been here. Yep. My name's Abby. I'm um what am I? You're a clinical nurse, aren't you? Hang on. Take your time. Nothing has to be perfect. Um my name's Abby. Um I'm a clinical nurse at the hospital for RHD. I've been in Mount Isa for roughly a year or so. Um I'm new to the RHD team. Um I don't know. That's cool. What do you do for the job? Like what's the main sort of thing that you cover? Um so my main role is working in the community with RHD clients. We go and visit them, make sure that they're up to date with all of our all of their RHD cares. We see new clients um and it's a holistic approach to their disease and um yeah. Cool. Explain a little bit about what so if you do like what RHD is and like? Oh yeah. So RHD is rheumatic heart disease. It's um a heart disease that um affects the the valves of the heart and creates permanent scarring. Unfortunately it's a permanent disease. There's no cure or effective treatment other than trying to prevent further scarring and further damage to the heart. Cool. It's a good descriptor. Um can you tell us a bit about like a Mount Isa community and like it's um like why do you think there are risk factors in relation to RHD um in the community? Um we have a high um Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in Mount Isa and um RHD is very common in in that demographic. Um so I'm really excited about what that looks like. that demographic and we also have lots of issues with housing and poverty particularly in the northwest unfortunately and access being rural and remote accessing the cares can be difficult for our clients so our role is to kind of break down those barriers and provide direct care in community rather than our clients coming to clinic which can be difficult and like oh no Jerry what I I did see that but I forgot to I haven't heard that so yeah okay sorry in community health we try and raise awareness about acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease by being present in the community speaking to local community members working together with other community organizations and providing the direct care is probably the biggest way to spread awareness if we can show that we're actively helping and trying to prevent further RHD then I feel like that's is a way of raising awareness we also provide education to our clinicians who work here we have a massive turnover of staff in this community just due to the location and we have lots of clinicians who come here who've never heard of rheumatic heart disease so always providing education to our clinicians and yeah if we run into someone in the community and they're asking questions we always are happy to educate and provide clarification I guess that's cool what's involved in the training of it like what's the steps I guess you take to support people who have RHD so we our job we make sure that our clients are seeing cardiologist or a heart doctor regularly that they're getting scans of their heart regularly maybe like there's a patient Oral Health medication in a very complicated illness to look after a patient in an emergency situations for whether it's substance abuse or, you know, to OxfordPEP or tiredness basis yep so mainly making sure that they're Oral Health and their general well-being is up to date we also have clients who are on what's called secondary prophylaxis which is an antibiotic injection that we give to prevent further damage yeah and what's the risk if it's not managed what happens ? yeah that Guy started this business about 2 1 million dollars worth of treatment at home so he was not sçirent they back on everyone's資ac what's happening right now and they're all options to sign up yeah so yeah, so I'm just kind second Tulip she's a Europe expert age who's been there請 to protect the bucktasse and she wants you know it and she's vidajector component of theThat's how we do it at this time yeah so we really try and hopefully managed I guess like what happens to people they don't get the management the treatment if we don't manage our clients with rheumatic heart disease and they're left untreated it causes the risk of further damage to the heart and if the heart receives too much damage they are at the risk of having surgery to have valve replacement and like long time lifelong medications yeah I don't know what you mean you have to kind of explain that so like if community have access to laundry and that means that they can wash their clothes in hot laundry to kill bacteria and stuff like that is that a preventative opportunity for people who have RHD like how does that is there a linkage between yeah yeah I just don't know how to word it that's okay there'll be more of it for being such a yeah preventing baby yeah, yeah, yeah well do you want to jump in and talk about that so you yeah you like it can be crossed because that's kind of like a healthy skin thing sure so let's frame let's reframe it how does a collaborative effort across health services support people with RHD like why do we need a lot of collaboration and support across general health and well-being to make sure that RHD is managed because RHD is preventable and we have services like our healthy skin team Gp practices and that that help prevent rheumatic fever which leads to rheumatic heart disease and what we call as primordial prevention is like washing your clothes having a shower shower every day for example as we talk about ultimatelyeme singling out certain conditions which can be that some cases you have to like reminded every single day of the daily 5 to 12 hours of our wraps getting out of desse dzet must prevent RHD shower every day, keeping your skin sores clean, preventing sore throats. If we can have things that can help or if we have services like Orange Sky that can come in and help clients with that then we are kind of killing the disease at the start rather than clients getting the disease and then treating on from there. Cool, that's good, that's awesome. Last question I guess is like if you had a magic wand and you could cure it, what do you think that would look like in community? What would be the outcomes for community if RHD was managed? What would that look like for you? Yeah, that's a really hard question. What do you hope and dream I guess for your time in Mount Isa? What do you hope to achieve? What outcomes would you like to see achieved over the next little while? Specifically around what you were trying to do? Um, I don't know. Take your time. What outcomes would you like to see happen over the next little while? If I could wave my magic wand, fix everything, that would be great but I mean like rheumatic heart disease is, fixing rheumatic heart disease is not the problem that we should be focusing on. I mean it's more so like of your social issues that is the primary problem and if we can fix those issues like your housing, your access to healthcare, we're in better step, we're stepping in a better direction of eradicating rheumatic heart disease I guess. Cool, that's exactly what I was looking for. Okay. Okay, that's it. Well done. Smashed it. Okay.\n",

Be an Indigenous Leader integrating fitness, mentoring and cultural connection in youth justice. Take it away.\n- 00:36 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Thank you so much for having us. I just want you to just take a breath for a sec. So if you feel comfortable, you can close your eyes for me, if that's okay. If you don't feel comfortable closing your eyes, that's totally fine. So if you just take a little breath here and just think about why you're here, just have a bit of a think about how your body feels, think about your toes, give them a little wiggle if you want, make sure you're still alive. And I just want you to imagine that we're sitting in circle.\n- 01:18 We weren't able to achieve this at this session, so if we can imagine we're sitting in a circle, just think about a little fire in the middle of the circle. You can rub your hands together a little bit, a bit of warmth on your palms, and then just bring your hands up to your heart, feel those warmth of the fire deep in your chest. And now, once you're ready, open up your eyes. So pumped to be here, so pumped to have this fella up here with me. He's a little nervous, so let's give him a round of applause, brady tonight. So, brady, over to you, mate, for a little acknowledgement and to bring us in.\n- 02:04 - Brodie Germaine (Host) Yeah, First time holding a mic. I just want to pay acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Wurundjeri Nation, both past, present and emerging. I also want to acknowledge everyone in the room today and giving me this opportunity to speak. You know, this is the. I'm from Mount Isa, queensland, small little town, and I grew up in small little Aboriginal communities my whole life. So you know, first time in Sydney, actually second time in Sydney, so I'm a bit nervous, but I think I'm. I'm very honored to be here, very grateful, you know, to be able to share my story and you know my upbringing and the work that I do and, yeah, so very grateful. So, thank you, well done, brody well done, all right.\n- 02:48 - Benjamin Knight (Host) So I want you to understand this you're part of the journey here today. So, brody um, he started a little program in mount eisen and we're working together on bringing that to life. Now. Brody is very good at getting these kids engaged and we're learning how to build a business and this is actually gonna be a live podcast, our live system. So just be careful then. Than you say might be recorded, but we want to be able to create this as a bit of a conversational pace and for you to be able to hear Brodie's magic. So I just wanted to have a shout out to you. Like, I got to spend a bit of time in Sydney on Gadigal land and I know, like George Street, I think, was an awesome site, trade route for the people that were here first and this Eora nation here, which means here with place, just pumped to be in this place and super proud to be sitting here with a young Indigenous leader with you all. So, brodie, are you ready?\n- 03:47 - Brodie Germaine (Host) Yeah, go on.\n- 03:49 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Welcome to this live podcast with Brodie Germain at the reintegration conference. Brodie's gonna kick us off with just who you are. Tell us a bit of your story, mate.\n- 03:59 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So, yeah, my name is Brodie Germain. I own a business in Mount Isa, brodie Germain Fitness. I also work in child protection for the last eight years out of our local Aboriginal medical service. Yeah, I'm a proud Pita Pita Wakai man. So my grandmother she's from a small community, booyah, so in Northwest Queensland, with 300 people live there, and my grandfather he's from Katherine but grew up in Kemawool, which is about 200 people live there, and my grandfather, he's from Katherine but grew up in Camberwell, which is about 200 people live there. So you know my grandparents grew up in those little communities. I've grown up in Mount Isa, calcadoon country, so I think Mount Isa has about 18,000 people does five minutes to do a perimeter of our town. So it's pretty deadly. If you start work at 8 30 you can wake up at 8 20 and get to work on time. But, um, yeah, so that's my intro.\n- 04:51 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Yeah, right, thanks brian, tell them about how we met and what randomness um happened when we met yeah.\n- 04:58 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So, um, I work. So I I work in child protection and as well as the business. So from 5.30 to 7.30, I work on my business, whether that's content or responding to emails and building myself up to be a good business person. And then 8.30 to 4.30, I work full-time at the AMS, then 5.30 to 7.30, I'm back in the gym. So I keep myself busy, because that's what's helped me become the man I am today and keep me on the straight and narrow. But I work.\n- 05:29 One week man. I was in one week in Duma G. Duma G is a very rural, remote Aboriginal community. You know, I've lived, I've worked up there for four years. The story was I got an email from a fellow named Benjamin nights and I'm a bit funny with emails and phone calls, you know, like if I don't know him I won't answer, if I don't know the email won't respond. I'm a bit shame, you know so. So Ben emailed me and I thought it was a spam. So I said, no, you're right. Like I said, no, you're right, I won't respond. And then he kept ringing and, um, what happened was I was in Doomadgee and those who know Doomadgee being real remote, reception's pretty bad. So I end up saying I'll go on, I'll ring him up. I rang him up and we're having a yarn and we connected up. He actually saw my story on the ABC which they put on TV and it went quite viral, I guess you'd say and yeah, he saw my story story. And so then we started yarning and I looked I was thinking this fellow a bit rude. You know you're not answering me, but I didn't realize the reception knocked out so I was spinning a 10 minute yarn with no one so I had to redo it, you know. So, oh the fucking hell. So so I g'd myself up again, you know, like I've got g'd myself up again, rang him up and then we had that yarn and we connected up. So you know, ben benjamin has been a real important person in my life, you know he's, he's built me my confidence, he's got me here.\n- 06:58 I'd never think I'd be in sydney my second time. I never really left mount isa. You know I had seafood for the first time last year. You know I didn't even know what Uber was till last year. I know what Uber Eats is, as you can tell, but yeah, so I'm very grateful to meet someone like Ben that has been on this journey with me and has supported me. You know I don't know much about business, or you know much. You know I didn't apply myself in school. I was good at football and that was it, and I was good at crime. But I'm, you know, having someone like Ben that has looked out for me and reached out to me and answered the phone. Yeah, it was deadly. So that's how we met thanks, mate.\n- 07:40 - Benjamin Knight (Host) I wish I could give it like that, ten minutes, just to find out what you said, just in case case. We're super involved. I don't even know. What I really want to know, brodie, is the reason why I reached out, and the reason why you're an important person in my life now as well is you had that experience in Mad Isa, and the way in which you tell your experience of childhood is very vivid and something in which I didn't have, I guess. And then to come out of that and want to give back to kids like you were in the community is super amazing. So I'd love you to tell everyone just like, what was that journey like from getting in trouble driving around in cars that you're not supposed to drive in, like getting into mischief. What was that journey from that to what you're trying to do now?\n- 08:30 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So I think I met someone yesterday, jacob Little and really inspired by his story, and we spoke about what the word normal was, what is normal? So I thought I had a normal life growing up, you know. But when I speak about it to my counsellor and speak to health professional, it wasn't quite as normal as I thought. You know, growing up, you know, I grew up in a housing commission. I'm Aboriginal but I was always the white boy. You know my colour of my skin. I'd go out to parties at 30 and I'd get flogged up because I was a white boy, you know.\n- 09:04 So I grew up around a lot of violence, a lot of domestic violence. You know a lot of my family in and out of jail, a lot of my aunties and uncles in and out of jail. You know, I nearly did some time myself. But just growing up in Mount Isa is just, I don't know for me. Now, as I've got older, I really appreciate the little things and that's the quote I live by. You know you don't get to realize what you know, others have so. But but growing up in Mount Ize, I love it, you know. It's a small little community. You make your fun, you, we don't have the resources, we don't have Uber Eats, but you know it's, it's what you make of it and that's what's made me the man that I am today. Um, you know, I look after my community and I moved away, played footy and was under contract and I gave it all away, you know, because drugs, alcohol. But I moved back to my community because I want to give back and that's something I thrive by.\n- 09:59 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Tell us a little bit about the story that resonates for me is when you went at Camden Country and lucky enough to be mentored by the awesome Ernie Dingo as part of that. I'd love to hear about what that experience was like sharing a story in that group yeah.\n- 10:14 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So, um, I'll go back this bit. So I did grow up, growing up, I was real got into a lot of trouble stealing cars, you know, breaking enters, um, you know I couldn't go to a shop without stealing. I don't know what it was, it just is I just bad, but um, always getting up to mischief. And when I grew up I was I wasn't good at much things. You know, I didn't have much good role models. All my uncles are idolized, but idolize, idolised them because they had the Gucci. They were gangsters. You know, I wanted to be like them. But you know, growing up I was good at footy. So you know, I was very grateful.\n- 10:52 I made Queensland under-16s when I was 15. Then the year after I made Queensland again. Then I made under-18s Queensland twice and I ended up captaining the Queensland side and a boy from the bush was a huge thing, you know. And I ran the boys out and um, that's kind of where, like that leadership come into it. But as um leadership comes, you know, like when I was around 18, being, you know, captain in the footy side, you know I didn't know what a leader was, so it it was a bit overwhelming. I got a footy contract down at Townsville where I played rugby league.\n- 11:26 I was in the 20 system and then I tried drugs. I didn't even know what drugs were. I knew what marijuana was because my parents were on it, but I tried drugs for the first time and that kind of just went downhill. I gave up all the footy gave up who I was as a man, my morals. I was doing some pretty stupid shit. So I sit here today with a lot of regret, but I don't, because it's what's shaped me. The hardship and the struggles and the choices that I've made has made me who I am today. But yeah, so I think did you want me to talk about?\n- 12:02 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Yeah, tell us a little bit about that campaign on country and what that experience was like and why we do it.\n- 12:08 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So from there I was always on this roller coaster and then I got into work. I worked at a meal prep business. I actually got fired because I thought you could eat all the food for free I'm not even joking, you know, here's someone who's selling drugs and that and didn't have no job and I thought, you know where I work, I eat for free. So I was pumping meals every session and I was stealing them and, yeah, I got fired within a couple weeks. But, um, I ended up getting a job, having my local AMS, um in, uh, preventative health, social preventative health and that's when it got me into working with young kids. It made me feel real deadly, because you know, like I was one of them, kids, you know the disengage I don't like saying the word disengage, but a young person that may have had some troubles and doesn't know, you know the right path and that got me into working in the child protection space and from there what Ben was saying, I got into doing men's groups and working alongside my elders and community. That looked out for me, and then the only dingo stuff. So we did a men's camp up in Normanton, a place called Delta Downs, and I don't think I've shared this in a group. But the week before I committed suicide and I woke up in hospital and it was quite a. I refused to go to the camp because I was just in a state, I was heavily on drugs and I didn't want to go to this camp. I said, no, fuck the camp you know like. But my partner my partner still, you know she said you've got to go to this camp, you know, get uncomfortable to get comfortable. So I did it. I made it sure that I didn't want to be part of this camp. So that's when I went. You know, I've always lived my culture. You know whether the color of my skin, I'm proud to be aboriginal, you know, and and I'm proud to do the things that I do.\n- 13:57 So when we were out on country with ernie dingo, we were in a yarning circle and we're going to do it today but there was 60 of us, 60 men, and I was sitting there and I was quite emotional, but I was, I don't know. I was in this weird state. I just got out of hospital because of what I did. I hung myself and I thought it was it.\n- 14:16 I woke up and Ernie Dingo come up to me and he said, brother, are you all good? I said yeah, I'm all good, typical male. I said yeah, I'm all good. And he said I'm good because I'd like you to speak. I said nah, fuck that, I'm not speaking. I said no, I'm not speaking. Eventually I said he just put it on me.\n- 14:39 So we're out on country, we take our shoes off, we put our feet in the sand, grab some sticks. It keeps me grounded, you know. So I was a bit comfortable and then he just said you know what's going on, I want to know about Brody Germain. So I told him. I broke down in tears and that was the first time I ever talked about my personal life. I think I talked for about 20 minutes and that was the first time anyone's given me an opportunity to speak up, because I'm a bit shamed. Normally, you know, I keep to myself and I always have. You know, I'm very independent. So that experience has led to what we're doing now. So you know, ernie's given me his Camping on Country program and I've been facilitating it throughout Mount Isa Lower Gulf and we've had over maybe 500 men that we've taken out on country over nine camps all throughout the Gulf, and that's why I'm here today. You know I think that's my purpose. You know, giving back to my community and giving you know helping men across Mount Isa Lower Gulf.\n- 15:41 - Benjamin Knight (Host) So cool yeah, round of applause. Thank you, eyes of lower gold so cool, yeah, round of applause. I was lucky enough to live in Mattis for three years probably like 15 years ago, showing my age now but I was very intrigued coming back and hearing that the watch houses with the young people. They're full every single day, overcrowded. When you talk to the community around young people, they essentially go to youth crime as the first topic of conversation and when you're there just cruising around, like the kids are just cruising right, they're on their bikes cruising around and I think the things that brody's trying to do is an outlet, a place to go, a support. So, brody, why don't you take them through what the gym is?\n- 16:32 - Brodie Germaine (Host) yeah and then what that sort of gym experience, how that translates to going on country as part of that experience so and I think that you know, for a lot of us, exercise is one of the best tools for not only our physical health, our mental health. And you know, if fitness doesn't mean a gym, it can be going out taking your dog for a walk, walking up, you know, up a hill or doing anything. So the gym I I kind of started at the gym during covid. I was doing pts in my shed and then I just I was just going to different gyms working out and then eventually found my own space and I've got my own gym now. So as part, as well as doing the child protection work, so what we do, the exercise is a great tool for what we do to get young people you know, both male and females into the gym, knowing that there's a safe space where they can exercise without you know, both male and females into the gym, knowing that there's a safe space where they can exercise without, you know, getting mount isa, being a small community, a lot of lateral violence we deal with, you know. But, um, the gym is a good tool to get people in the doors and then from there we can offer a lot more like our on-country programs.\n- 17:39 So what our on country programs consist of it's. You know it's. We take young men. At the moment for seven days we go out six hours from the town, out on country, no reception. We got sat phones and we got ambulance on board, paramedics. Sorry, just in case, but there's no reception, so there's no phones. And what being on country teaches me and teaches young people is being present. I think we always sit here we worry about what's happening in a week's time, a month's time, but when you're out on country, it's just you and country. You know. So you get to learn things. You know, I teach a lot of my brother boys. You know how to make did you do's, and that that's something I do because I have bad anxiety, but playing the didgeridoo has helped me with my breathing when I'm stressing out. Back then it was grog and other shit. But yeah, being on country keeps me grounded and I'm very privileged to be able to work in a lot of areas all throughout the Gulf and yeah, Since I started working with Brodie.\n- 18:50 - Benjamin Knight (Host) I think it's been really interesting, especially when you're starting to look for grants right, and you're like, well, how does this grant work? And part of the grants is always cultural engagement and a lot of the time it's like get a letter from someone or like, how does that work? So Brodie and I have been really focused on what does that actually look like to consult an elder, a community member, and Brodie just does it naturally and it's yarning and it's connecting. So, brodie, do you want to have just a couple of minutes on what that experience is like and how we want to be able to grow that experience to be more than just a letterman?\n- 19:23 - Brodie Germaine (Host) So, just, you know, when you go on for our culture, you know, going on someone else's country it's important's important. You know you got to go through those protocols and what you can and can't do, but, um, something that works for me is having that yarn and actually inviting our elders from that area to be part of the part of what we do, you know. So I don't go out on someone else's country without someone from that area, an elder. And every camp that I've facilitated I've had elders from that area and the beauty of that is they're from that area. They know the history, they've got kinship, they know who mob are from there and it's really powerful because they get to see firsthand. It's hard to explain right now what a camp is, but when you come and do it with an elder, it's deadly because it's powerful. The elders get to see what it's deadly because it's powerful. The elders get to see what it's like to be going out bush, we get I don't know if he's no killers. You know we get fresh beef, we go in with a full esky, we catch barra, we eat stingrays. You know we make our spears, we literally live off the land and it's, um, it's deadly because these things here is kills us. You know our young people. So when young people are isolated out on country there's no reception, the phones don't even bother, so it's like that quota loop. I appreciate the little things when you're out on country. You make things and you do things and yeah, it's pretty powerful when you do it.\n- 20:46 And I'm hoping to expand. So I've ran nine camps throughout Mount Isa Lower Gulf for those that know those areas. So Mount Isa, doolmurji, normanton, burktown, booyah, dajara and hopefully up Mornington Island. But we're looking at some cultural exchange in the future with getting people Mike and Joe maybe. So what we're hoping to do is speak.\n- 21:12 For some of myself I've only been to Sydney once. We want to do some cultural exchange where we take young people from Mount Isa, lower Gulf, first Nation junk people, and bring them up to Sydney and vice versa, take young people from Sydney, take them out of my country, you know, out the Gulf. And just to show that, like for me, I never went to a footy game till last year and I spun out. You know I didn't. I never ate seafood till last year or an uber eats. You know, these are things that a lot of our mob back home and low in real remote areas never experienced. I showed my brother boy how to order from culture kings, like hidden here, like some things we take for granted, you know. So there's a lot of things that I hear you see from us. Mob up northwest area You'll be like holy shit.\n- 22:00 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Yeah. So just on that, we were able to organise a bit of like that cultural exchange type scenario. So there is a fella here's names joke one. There he is, big round of applause for Joe Kwan, I totally. I sent him a message yesterday and said can you, can you be part of my talk, our talk? And he's like yeah, for sure. And then I asked him again today and he's like I thought you meant can you talk about me? Not, I need to talk, so but I'm stitching him up right now just to see if he wants to know he's shaking his. Come on, joe, come on, come on, come up here, I'll swap.\n- 22:57 - Joe Kwon (Host) Tell us, tell us about your, in that eyes, experience. You only got two minutes. This is not awkward at all, sick. Thanks, brother. Yeah, I had the privilege.\n- 22:57 Brodie and Ben invited myself and the team up to Mount Isa. We'd never been anywhere, literally we were flying in and it was like dirt. I was like what are we in for? We got there, it was 50 degrees. So, just like Brodie being very, you know, having Sydney be very foreign to him, mount Isa was very foreign for myself and the team. But it was a bit of an eye opener.\n- 23:17 You know, he kindly invited us to Kalkadoon land and taught us about the land and about the culture and traditions and we run programs. So I'm from Confit Confit, conflict combat pathways and we run mentoring programs in every youth justice center across new south wales. Um, and we have a lot of indigenous young people part of our program who are so disengaged you don't like the word disengage but they don't know enough about their own culture. Um, I'm not aboriginal but when I went there I learned so much um and I came back and talked to our young people and they had no idea they were indigenous young people and I said how cool would it be if we could get our Sydney kids over to Mount Isa and then have all the Mount Isa kids who have never seen a building over five stories tall to come to Sydney.\n- 24:04 And we've got partnerships with partnerships with orphans, like NRL. Um, you know, we will offer, you know, tickets to go see a footy game. And how cool would it be if we can kind of open up the mindset of young people in regional areas like this and just start to show them that there are more opportunities than you know what's in Mount Isa and what they can bring, ideas that they can bring back to the towns. So that was the concept and the idea of what we wanted to do to collaborate.\n- 24:35 And Brodie was saying he's grateful for all the little things and that's a lot of the things that we teach in our programs, which are called the G-code, which is Stanceful, gratitude, goal Setting and Be Grounded. And we thought there were so many synergies and we're about to launch our mentoring program in Mount Isa this September which will be partnered with Brodie and with Ben. So we're really looking forward to that.\n- 25:03 - Brodie Germaine (Host) Thank you, brother.\n- 25:04 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Right on, mate, Stop Thanks brother Stopped on such a good job, mate, Show me up here. Thank you so much. Thanks, Joe. Thanks mate.\n- 25:13 - Brodie Germaine (Host) But to add to that is like having that opportunity with Joe and the Confit team, like once again I was spinning out Like I didn't know what was going on but when taken showing like something I grew up with, mount Isa lived out the bush my whole life, you know.\n- 25:33 So when I took Joe and his team out bush, they were looking around. Joe was jumping around for snakes and like, and us boys, like when we used to get drunk, you know, you used to go out and catch crocodiles. So I'm saying a Joe does like I'm gonna catch a crocodile this week. He's like no, you're not, you're not gonna catch a crocodile. And like, so just showing like stock though we did catching snakes and hunting, fishing and that like what we is the word normal we talked about. So it was really, really awesome to have mob from sydney come to mount isa and the idea joke come about, this cultural exchange and I'm very grateful to be, you know, in partnership with confit and also, you know, giving an opportunity where young people that would probably never leave the bush come to the city.\n- 26:16 - Benjamin Knight (Host) That's amazing. So good. We're gonna have to wrap up soon, which is pretty wild. But one thing that Brodie's been working on is this whole idea of self-promotion and getting things out there. So where can people find you, bro brody, and find information about you?\n- 26:32 - Brodie Germaine (Host) so just on instagram at brody, gmail, fitness or facebook. Um, we're actually looking at it, nearly finished the website, so we'll have a website with all our content um what we offer, a lot of the camps I do with ernie, our yarns, um working in the youth justice space, child protection space. So yeah, so just brody to my fitness on instagram for now and then stay tuned and uh, yeah, so we do have a few questions.\n- 27:00 - Benjamin Knight (Host) I'm going to run around with the microphone. Anyone got questions for brody or for me, but you don't have to talk to me you don't have to talk to me.\n- 27:12 - Tina McPhee (Host) Hey, mate, yeah, good to meet you this weekend. Oh, this week is not a weekend yet, but do you guys just, do you work just with males, and what's stopping you from working with females? Who?\n- 27:22 - Brodie Germaine (Host) can't work with females. So I think it's just what's appropriate. You know it's protocols for us. You know, men with men's business, it's just trying to find a. I'd love to work with women but culturally I just couldn't and it's not part of the protocol. So eventually it would love looking at employing a and did an indigenous female to work with the women and the beauty ruled up will be I'll work with the men that work or works with the women separately for the men's and women's business, but then we come together and we share our knowledge. So that's the goal, hopefully.\n- 27:53 Yeah, I sorry to add to that I currently have five employees work for my business. Out of the five, two of them from the residential campus and they're from like one from Booyah, one from Mornington, so they're real shy little fellas. But I've got a male and a female working and I'm hopefully going to get them to do a cert degree in fitness and cover the cost, so they say. And the other workers they do the morning classes and when I'm in Doormadgee. So, yeah, so I got five employees at the moment, hopefully six with the female. Yeah, hi, brodie moment. Hopefully six of the female. Yeah, woo, where's that Go on it's been cold hey.\n- 28:53 Brodie. Nah, thank you for that.\n- 28:57 - Benjamin Knight (Host) One minute to go, one question.\n- 29:02 - Brodie Germaine (Host) Thank you.\n- 29:03 - Benjamin Knight (Host) Any other questions? You going to interview me, Mo? Hey, it's good Busy Bro. Did you have a question for anyone in the crowd?\n- 29:15 - Brodie Germaine (Host) No more, not a question. I just want to say thank you for everyone attending and giving me an opportunity to talk about my story and the work that I do, and very privileged to be here and very grateful. So thank you all.\n- **Interview in car to Kajabi**\n- Last person yeah I yeah was yeah we're gonna go through maybe two oh this is nice yeah tell us tell us where we're going and probably why I guess so today we're one of the biggest massacres for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people in the Kalkadoon area for Kalkadoon people so we've got traditional owners with us Cameron, Jessie and Cherie that have taken us out on their country the Shoala Scaddle Mountain, talk about the history of it the massacre itself and where the troopers actually the massacre happened where it took place but also we're just going out on country to Kijabi as well afterwards Kijabi is a small little township I believe but it's just a little pub in the middle of nowhere we'll just head out there and have lunch but it's good to go out there and support them the pub you know go see a lot of kangaroos, emus, bush turkeys, guanas if we're lucky with a bit of rain around yeah and tell us what it feels like bringing non-indigenous people out to these places and being out, would you like to share that?\n- It's beautiful to show our culture practically too you know we you see videos, photos but being able to take anyone out especially the config crewing yourself out on country to show the beautiful sight of Kalkadoon country in Mt Isa it's very grateful makes me feel really good and I know the crew in front of us will be really grateful to show you their country and there's like obviously tons of stuff happening with young people in Isa and around what's it feel like and what difference do you think it makes to take the kids out on country who are connected to it by skin or kinship or their own country?\n- We don't, the behaviour they're doing in that, you know it's not acceptable but I think what needs to happen is more on country programs, taking young people out out bush, showing them that there's more to life than to participate in crime and criminal activity. You know, going out bush, sitting by the water, yarning, having men's business, women's business, being connected and being like one of the G's, CONFID talk about being grounded, that's healing for our people and I think for a lot of people when you just, the feeling you get when you go out out on country, you know, makes you feel like a sense of belonging.\n- But yeah, I think it's like having CONFID, showing, being able to show CONFID, you know, the beautiful country we have out here is deadly, yeah.\n- And like, the culture stuff's super important and like, I think the opportunity to help kids connect with it is something that's integral and, but there's this also, is that a layer of, like what does it, what do you think the difference is to being able to introduce, like someone like CONFID that has like that lived experience as part of it, and then connecting that to the cultural aspect as well, like what does that add, I guess?\n- CONFID bring to Mt Isa and the community of Mt Isa, they're through their life stories, the hardship, the struggles, but also their achievements and where they are now, and what, you know, what they do now is through the storytelling and the mentorship, like, I think when you have that and you've gone through a lot of those things and now you're vulnerable and you share those things with young people, you connect very well. When you connect, that's when you can, you know, support young people, help them with employment or help them with programs and stuff like that. But I think the biggest thing is like being, like we're all vulnerable, we're all open, we're being real with these young people. But, no, yeah, it's good.\n- And what's like, we were talking before, there's this like, almost like cross cultural thing that can happen with, like if there's an opportunity to send some Indigenous kids local up here, down there, but also some city kids up here, it's almost like a, like a sharing of culture, like definitely something that you feel like would increase that like worldliness slash confidence of some of the kids up here.\n- Definitely, I think it would, like if we were to be at like BG Fit, if we was to bring some of the young people we work with on a day to day basis, and give them an experience to take them to Confit and take them to like Sydney, Confit and meet the team. I think it would open their eyes up to, you know, a different side of the world. Out here, we will, it's very rural remote. You know, we don't have much out here, but we appreciate the little things and we make our fun. And I think it'd be really great to share our knowledge of culture, our knowledge of hunting, fishing, camping and all that stuff with Confit and vice versa. You know, if we were, if we take young people down to Confit, I know for a fact, a lot of the young people would never have been to Sydney. They've never seen city lights, multiple lanes, you know, driving and all that stuff. You know, so it'd be, it'd be awesome to show young people both ways, you know, the different side, like the urban city compared to rural and remote definitely.\n- And like, this might be a hard question, like how many kids are we talking about in terms of numbers up here that might be impacted? Like, is it in the hundreds, thousands? What, like if you could guess, I guess, like across community in Mount Isa, how many kids do you think you could impact over like a year?\n- You know, and that's with taking them out, young people out on country, showing them cultures, having meant doing mentoring, having their yarning circles and stuff like that, engaging young people into services that are going to support them with their family well-being, you know, all those social determinants of health. But I think around the hundred because, you know, sometimes it's a, we provide a lot of support for young people in the community and sometimes they make the mistake of reoffending. For us, that's part of life, you know, sometimes you got to mess up to learn, but it's up to, you know, once they do what they do and, you know, we then support that young person to, hey, you know, you've done the wrong thing or whatever, let's get back on track and let's support you. Let's start again. Yeah.\n- That's cool man. And then there's a, I guess there's this opportunity to share this more broadly with like the community or the world, like as a story. What would you want other people to take away from this story I guess, like especially people who might not have a concept of culture, but also what I've been thinking about lately is like there's a huge media culture at the moment, especially in Queensland around like having a tough on crime approach and making sure kids are brought to justice and I guess this narrative of like just crime crisis for youth. Like what would you hope people can sort of take away and change their narrative a bit?\n- Yeah so like in the media you see like two news stories a day\n- of a kid stealing a car and what happens is, or what has happened in the last year I guess is the government has now got a tough on crime approach, we're building more prisons, we're trying to create this like punishment methodology. What do you think we should try and do with these stories to help people understand alternatives to punishment, alternatives to prison I guess.\n- But invest more money into programs that are supporting young people to, you know, rather than sending them to prison, you know, helping them with basic things, whether it's, I don't know, employment pathways, education, helping them with a birth certificate, driver's license, the basic things, the basic life skills we sometimes take for granted, you know. I think those are the things we should support young people with to become, to build their confidence, build their strength, to be young leaders in their community, to hopefully pass down to the next generation coming through.\n- Cool, that's good sash.\n## Sit down interview\n- Alright bro. So if you just look at me, I reckon, I could maybe not frame you good. that's Yeah, up. Yeah, Hey, you want me to sit like this? yeah. The sun's coming out now. Ah, that's right. does It pretty good with light. the I'm just sweating, that's right. Alright bro, we're on. So just do your name and spell it just in case. Yep, so I didn't look at you? Yeah. Jermaine, Brodie B-R-O-D-I-E-G-E-R-M-A-I-N-E. Sick. So I think it's going to be hot and it's going to be a bit buff, so take it easy and do it however. Yes, it is. So just tell me a little bit I guess, in a few words or a lot of words I guess, tell me a little bit about yourself. I always let people choose their own identity I guess, if you want to identify with a particular part of yourself, whatever. But just talk about who you are for a little bit. Just like name, where I'm from? Yep, now you identify whether you want to talk about your family whatever. or And then do I finish with Brodie Jermaine Fitness at the end maybe? Yeah, for sure. So just stare at you, yeah? Yeah. You got me nervous bro, I'm nervous. Nah, it's alright. My name is Brodie Jermaine. I'm a proud Pita Pita Waka'i man. Born and raised on Kalkadoon country, so Mount Isa. You know, I was born and raised in Mount Isa, grew up here, did most of my schooling here. Then I was very grateful to go to a rugby league school in Townsville at Ignatius Park College and graduated there. From there, you know, I ended up moving back to Mount Isa and got into working in an Aboriginal medical service and then also doing some studies around becoming a personal trainer and then that's led me to becoming a business owner, so owning my own company, Brodie Jermaine Fitness. Tell us a bit about Mount Isa. What's your vibe on Mount Isa? Good, bad, ugly? Look, personally, I love Mount Isa. Mount Isa's home to me. I guess, you know, there's a lot of negativity towards Mount Isa at the moment when it comes to youth crime and that, which I totally understand, but Mount Isa, the country out here is beautiful, you know, this is my home. I love it out this way. What was the question? Just tell us about Mount Isa. What's feeling your of it? Like you were just starting to talk about, what's the perception vs reality? I guess that's what's happened out here. So, like talk about that youth crime stuff? Yeah, you can talk about crime youth or can you even just summarise it and say it's a mining town but it's with locals and maybe, you could even talk about what it feels like for communities to come into town and what that's like. So like what? What's living here? Yeah, so living in Mount Isa is, it makes you appreciate the little things, you know. Living in a rural and remote area, we've got a very diverse community, predominantly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But yeah, like I said, very diverse. Mount Isa being a mining town, we get a big influxuation of people from around the world, from around Australia that live here. But yeah, I absolutely love living in Mount Isa. I work full time here, I run my own business, my family's here, all my friends here, my partner, I bought a house and stuff like that. So yeah, there. And we'll talk about that youth. I reckon like what you could do is almost like you could start with your context of what it felt like to grow up as a young person and how that sort of led you to get in trouble and then lead into how that might feel for other young kids. Ah yeah, so growing up in... So I guess, growing up in Mount Isa, I lived down, when I was tiny, I lived down Abel Smith Parade. I remember the address was 77 George Street and for those from Mount Isa, we call it Jack's down there. Lived down there until I was like 6 or 7 years old I think, before moving. Dad got a house over in Soldiers Hill. Yeah, it was like, growing up in Mount Isa, as a kid, it's what you make of it I guess. We get up to mischief, you make the wrong choices, you're hanging out with the wrong people. think But I don't know, I as a kid there's not much I guess. So it led to boredom and that's why we tended to do things that we're not proud of. But I think that's just being a kid and that's part of growing up. To now, going to school, I really enjoyed school. I wasn't the best at school and I didn't make the right choices a lot of the time. But school was a place where I had my friends, sports, and I really enjoyed that. What's the reality for kids at the moment? Do you think there's opportunities for kids out there? Or do you think there's, because there's obviously a lot of crime happening, a lot of bad shit going on. What's the reality for a young person here as they grow up? Yeah, so I think with young people living in Mount Isa, I feel if a young person's not engaged in school, what's there for them to do? And my view is that young people in the community should be in that school age, they should be in school. We talk about alternative programs and there's a lot of service delivery towards these young people that aren't at school. But ideally, these young people should be out of school, they should be getting an education, they should be trying their best to attend and the parents should be supporting them. What was the other one? Yeah, so why do you think kids are... I think if you can contextualize it as watch houses full all the time, why is it full? And you could always lead into it like that? Yeah. Because you get to engage with it until you know what's going on, you could just talk about... Like working with young people and what I see. Totally, yeah. So like working with young people in community, what I see is at the moment there's a ton of youth crime and the stolen cars, the break and enters, there's a lot of negativity towards these young people and I don't... What's the word? I'm not accepting it. What is it? Like you're not trying to justify it? Yeah, so at the moment there's a lot of young people that are being involved in youth crime and stealing cars, breaking enters and it's kind of being... These young people think it's normal for that to do things like this. I don't know if they're doing it to fit in or whatever but I think there needs to be more investment of programs to support young people and the parents. I always grew up, everything starts at home. I feel like parents need to be more accountable to understand and keep their child at home after 6pm, provide for them, provide dinner for them. What I see in Mt Isa working with young people is young people don't want to stay home. There's overcrowding in the house, drugs, alcohol, partying, all this crap going on. So what young people do is tend to leave home, walk the streets at night and then leads to them making the negative choices. That's good. Let's start leaning into your mission. What's your mission to be able to create in this region? You talked to me about it yesterday, there were thoughts about leaving Mt Isa but now you're here and you feel always compelled to do something. What's your propulsion? What do you want to do? My mission for Brody Jume Fitness is to provide fitness for community, to show my culture in community and provide programs and educational programs and a lot of program delivery to support people in this community. What was it again? I keep rambling. No, it's great. I'm nervous. I know. I'm fucking nervous. You can slow down. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's all right. So we'll start again. I reckon if you can just sort of start to speak about like the stuff you're doing now. And then build it into what you want to do. Yeah. Because maybe it's even just talking. I mean, like, have you got like a specific example you could pull as well? Like a particular follower that's been through some stuff and you have to say their name. See, a lot of the, like through Brody Jermaine Fitness is mostly exercise. But also program delivery, like working with young people in schools. Like, yeah, I'm not a particular person I could say about some of the programs that I run. Yeah, yeah. I think like thinking about like where you are now, where you want to be. Like what are you doing now and where you want to take it. So Brody Jermaine Fitness has kind of been established for I feel two years now. What we provide is, you know, we provide exercise programs, a variety of programs in community. We also provide cultural programs and we also provide educational programs in the schools and mentoring. in So the schools, what we do is we go into the schools, we do some exercise with young people. And exercise doesn't always have to be the gym. It's, you know, fun recreational activities, touch footy, things like that. And then after we do that, I go into the classroom for 30 to 40 minutes and, you know, whether it's reading books or helping the young people write, sometimes they teach me a few things too, but it's just providing, showing young people that, you know, exercise is a really good tool to support our physical and mental health. And that's kind of building that relationship and connection with young people. Then it leads into the classroom, you know, supporting young people in school. Trying to keep them engaged, working alongside the teachers and stuff like that, yeah. And then this whole opportunity to get them out on country, it must be fucking rad. What's that feel like when you take kids out on country? Especially when you've got elders and shit with you, what's that look like? Like paint a picture of it? Yeah, so when we take young people out on country, like giving them a sense of belonging, the programs we do out on country, we live our culture through fishing, hunting, yarning circles, things like that. The feeling I get taking people out on country is overwhelming, but I can't explain it. Being Aboriginal, I'm very passionate about my culture and being able to show people and community and Mount Isa Lower Gulf, my culture, it makes me feel proud. I'm really proud to do this. What was the other thing? Yeah, that's perfect. And let's lean into this whole idea with CONFIT. You had Joe out. I suppose you can do a story, right? How did you first come about hearing about them? And then what did it feel like to actually have them out here? What was that journey like? Talk about how you reached out? You knew CONFIT before right? me, Yeah, like knew of them, yeah. So like, always I heard of CONFIT, I believe maybe through social media. You know, I'd always check out their stuff and the work that they do. And straight away I was pretty, I'd say I was impressed, but I was also, I could relate to some of their stories. And I think that's why I wanted to do work with CONFIT, is because I've seen they all shared their story and were vulnerable. And that's something that I do when I run my camps is we open up about our past, our traumas, things like that. So seeing CONFIT on social media, I kind of could relate to some of their stories. And then we would see their posts and stuff like that. And then eventually we would talk about how we got in contact. I was approached by Benjamin through email. He saw a story about what I do in community and what I do in community with young people. And we kind of connected like that. From there, he kind of connected me up with CONFIT and we end up doing two days of community engagement alongside each other. Program delivery, even got him into the gym to throw some weight around and then went out on country for a day, which was something I'm always going to remember. Not often I have the opportunity to meet really great people like that and surrounding myself with like-minded people and really good role models and mentors. I'll remember those two days for the rest of my life and I don't think it's the last time I'll be with CONFIT. What was something that was rad that happened yesterday? What was something that stood out to you that was a rad experience? I think I'd say going out on country for the day, I think maybe think taking it for granted. As an Aboriginal person, we grow up, we go out bush all the time, we go fishing, we do all these things. Just talking, being able to take comfort out on country and show them with Kalkadoon traditional owners, show them, talk about history and stuff like that, it was eye-opening to see and it was quite a privilege to do that. What did I say sorry? Yeah, just what was one thing that stood out? What was something rad we did that awesome? was So, Confit, we went out to Kijabi Pub for lunch, just did the drive, I think it's 110, 20 kms on a dirt road, we saw some bush turkeys and that along the way, just that drive, just the yarns we had in the car. And then Confit was saying, we're in the middle of nowhere, which we were, and then you rock up to this amazing pub, Calcadoon Kijabi Pub. But yeah, that was probably a highlight, being able to go out from this dirt road and then take people that have never experienced rural and remote areas to a pub in the middle of nowhere, have a mad feed and then go down the river, see the water, and then afterwards I'd say showing the Confit crew, alongside a few others, how to find a didgeridoo, how to make it, talk about how the termites eat it and stuff like that. That was pretty mad. I think also just going out to Mary Kathleen, you know, we take for granted, Mount Isa, we have a lot around, it's just knowing where to go. But yeah, I really enjoyed that.\n- And I was in the car on the way back and it was me, you and Vy. And I learnt lots of things about Vy that I didn't know. How did it feel to have a city fella who's had a fucking mental life, sit in the car and talk to you about what life is like in Cabramatta, but then also for you to be able to share your existence in Mount Isa? How did that feel talking to Vy and hearing about the drugs and the chaos and the family? Like, is that something that's special you? to Yeah, definitely. Anyone that shares any personal information, stories, or talk about anything, I'm really grateful Vy shared his story. It was like his story from knowing what Vy shared with us in the car, from what he went through and where he is now, it's so inspiring. It actually gives me goosebumps talking about it because it's crazy how far he's come as an individual, the shit he went through, the hardship and all that stuff, to where he is now and what he does. I feel like when people talk about our lives and the stuff that we go through and where we are now and how we're trying to make a difference for ourselves and help support other people on their journey, it's really powerful. We're practicing what we preach but being vulnerable at times also and being able to open up and talk to one another about our stories. Vy is deadly, he's mad.\n- And tell me, in five years time, if we were sitting here in five years time, what would you have hoped would have happened in that amount of time for you and Brady's Remain Fitness and Mt Isa? My five year plan for Brady's Remain Fitness would be to turn it into a wellbeing centre. The dream would be to have a 24 hour gym with classes as well as classes. I'd also love to have a place for recovery, a place for young people for program delivery, education sessions. I think when I say wellbeing centre, I feel the dream for Brady's Remain Fitness would be a space where people of all, everyone in the community can go to for health, health and wellbeing, cultural programs, and even a space where they know that if you're feeling low and you need a safe space, you can come to the gym, or sorry, this wellbeing centre, you don't have to exercise, you can cook a feed, just somewhere in the community that people know that I'm trying to help them and I'm trying to make a difference here. That'd be the ultimate dream.\n- Yeah, place is so important I think. Your journey in itself, after spending two days with you, is fucking intense and insane. But I think if there's anyone in Mount Isa or anyone in Australia who has the opportunity to be able to step in and do some stuff, it's yourself. And I think it's not going to be all up, right? It's going to be up and down and all over the shop. But I think there's so much fucking capacity. The last thing I'll just, this is the last question and we can fucking get out of this zone. But like the, I've got this like dream, I guess, of building a network of people who can lean on each other. Yeah. Especially people with experience, but also for it to be a cross cultural experience where I can ring anyone up and say Brody's coming to Sydney. Or I can ring Joe up and I can say, this is going to come to Sydney and bring people like, what's a positive network for you, I guess. What's that look like and feel like for you? Like, and like, how do you think that would support you if you had like 10 Joes, I guess, around Australia? Like, what do you mean?\n- Yeah, so like if you had the opportunity to build a community of support around Australia, that you could like just jump on the phone or bring kids to or whatever. Like, do you think that would be something that would be supportive and like, what would that feel like, I guess? Yeah, like building a positive network or, I'm not answering. Yeah, it's a hard one. Yeah. That's why I'm spending years trying to work it out. Like how, what was it? Yeah, like community, like what does a supportive community, like what do you think you need as an individual to achieve those five year dreams? Like people like Joe and your network. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. I definitely want to surround myself with like minded people. I definitely want to surround myself and learn from people with lived experience, people that have definitely learned from people with lived experience to definitely learn from professionals. You know, my network.\n- Here is the transcription with the speaker tags and timestamps removed:\n- So maybe like even just explain like so I for context I stopped filming because there was fellas down there. What were they doing? So yeah we just come back from dinner camp quite interesting and a lot of a lot of mob down there well yeah actually in good spirits they were all drinking, partying we just drove through there and they all yelled out and said hello and carried on a bit which is I don't know every time I've gone down and speak with mob and you know help community like help people down there you know they there's been sometimes it's been they're a bit unsure of who I am and but always you know just give them that reassurance that hey you know all I'm here to do is just to either have a yarn or help you out or link you up with services and but every time I go down there I've always respected I respect everyone I talk to and work alongside them yeah but it was quite lovely just then gonna see the see the mob down there charging then you know that look like that like for a white city person like how do you explain what that like how do you think that culture why why people in this community sort of engaged like that because yeah I think sometimes from a middle-class white person they're like when you get pissed you're in your house with your mates behind closed doors like what's why why these fellas outside and doing this stuff I'm just like you know yeah like I think it's um so like drinking and the drinking the unemployment all these things have never been part of Aboriginal culture you know Aboriginal cultures has always been strong you know we're leaders we're role models or mentors we live our culture strongly through what we do you know throughout our identity going back on country but over time and it's just it is quite sad you know because I'm very passionate about my culture and I you know I do as much as I can for my people but um you know like when you see it's stuff like that with mob you know like drinking partying you know I do feel a bit sorry but I also think about you know our mob we have a choice they have a choice to wake up every day and drink and you also have a choice to wake up every day and go to work and that's their choice you know but um you know when I go down when I explain to people that I've never seen like like places like dinner camp or I'm sorry Arthur Peterson like you know I just say you know it is could be confronting I grew up around a lot of that so for me I love going see mob down there I see past clients or I see family members and that but but for someone who's never been exposed to that that it is a bit confronting and it is that it is quite sad but it also it goes back to that choice you know like yeah I always think like especially now after being away from it for a while like there's toxic communities all like toxic parts of culture in every type of thing like this toxic workplace culture there's toxic like relationships there's toxic like friendships these types of things like and I think sometimes that like Aboriginal people have fucking lived so much longer in terms of their culture yeah and like there's a different maybe need or want for this hustle culture or striving to like be successful in inverted commas like how do you think that affects the way in which like some people look at our indigenous culture when they like casting them as either lazy or like yeah and because they're because they're doing things outside all the time like it's very visible yeah like how does that sort of sit with you in terms of like when you might be some forms of racism or some like negative discussions around culture in general?\n- yeah like it is it is um you know like I said I'm very passionate and and I've lived my culture I live my culture every day but it's not part of our it's not part of Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander culture to you know to do all these negative things and it's sad to say but the statistics speak for themselves you know like unfortunately our mob our life expectancy is reduced is lower than the average non-indigenous person and me personally that is it's because of chronic disease it's it's it's all these things these factors that are preventable though you know if we aren't smoking every day doing drugs or you know we're unemployed that's not a healthy lifestyle and if you're not living a healthy lifestyle you're not gonna live for long so I do see there's two sides of it but yes that's it is it is hard to to talk about it in a way because it's um you know I just want to see the best for my people but sometimes unfortunately sometimes it's you know our people are the ones our people are making negative choices and but it's also being mindful that you know we not all our every Aboriginal person are the same when we talk about Aboriginal people openly some a lot of people think oh we're drunks we're alcoholics we're woman bashes we're you were drug addicts you know we stink or whatever like that's not that's not Aboriginal people so as long you know as long as us as health professionals and business owners we support Aboriginal Torres Islander people as best we can and try and provide them a pathway to you know to live a healthy lifestyle well I think that's what that's the first step and then it's up to that individual to make this step because they're the quote is you know you can't help someone that's not going to help themselves and as long as as a myself if I can help our mob to succeed and as best as I can and then it's up to them to make the if I can provide them with 50% of support it's up to them to do the rest on their own yeah so I think that like the politics you know it would also come under like the lateral violence in the community. Lateral violence across this community is it's it is quite high you know and rather than supporting people doing really well and working alongside each other there's a more there's a higher percentage of people that don't want to work alongside each other and would rather be negative towards people like myself and people in general that are doing really great work and you know that's just a little reminder for me that you know I can't do this the work that I do on my own so I'm gonna try and work alongside like-minded people and people that are gonna really have helped me but who I I see that there's a lot of value in that person or company or to best support community yeah yeah and like I think one thing that always came when I was doing programs there was a particular word that always get brought up and it was jealousy what's that word mean in terms of like a more modern day indigenous culture type experience like how does that play into some of the issues?\n- yeah well jealousy I think within like with the word jealousy around indigenous culture was kind of come under that lateral violence type of thing you know I'd also think I always question why as soon as an Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander person does really well I don't understand why people and this is both non-indigenous and indigenous people are jealous or have negative comments towards them rather than coming together and as one people go in silos and I don't really understand it hey it's so much easier when we work together you know black white purple whatever skin you are we all bleed the same so you know I try yeah but that jealousy is just I think it's everywhere you go and you know what like I just with\n- my personal stuff you know wouldn't say there could be people jealous jealous or but they are I do get a lot of lateral violence towards myself and a lot of negative comments and negative people speak negative about the work that I do but it does not faze me honestly because I know that I'm doing the best that I can for myself to provide for my community and I'm doing the best for everyone in this community around exercise health and well-being and cultural programs and you know rather people like or not that's what I'm gonna do so we like you you've been quite open around your story do you want us to want to take us somewhere where there was like a particular thing you were doing when you were younger that you really like or explain like a particular context about somewhere that like helps like ground people like to a place in that eyes are like some history that happened that you wouldn't miss really proud you yeah don't have to go too hard yeah what is trying to think I could just say just being openly like just driving around the streets you know my my parents I've always provided for my family like my brother my sister all of us my parents were great role models they always we always had a roof over our head always food dinner you know like food on the table mum and dad did everything and everything everything they could you know but for me and they still do I did but I did choose the wrong didn't make a little you know I fucked up a lot I fucked up in school I fucked up in life and and just driving around the streets I remember and you know like it's hard to talk about it's easy to talk with you but it's because my parents they they they probably made fuck all compared to what a lot of people know about my story but you know I remember with and feel my cousins one of my main cousins you know we would break in a lot of houses when we were young I remember we used to there was a house we'd always target would always target this house and this house always had soft drinks ice blocks it had chocolates in their back fridge I'd had wine we used to steal fucking ornaments and shit from there but every time they would leave we would they would it would be me that would jump the fence and you know we would steal anything out of the house sometimes we'd steal the fucking pop plan just for the fun of it and then it started becoming like all right let's let's let's steal from them this this house particularly when they're home so when they were home we would break into their house and you know that chaser or the dog would chase you but that was pretty fucking stupid you know we it sounds a little bit like a challenge is it was there parts of in which like there's a bit of a game slash challenge slash egging each other on to go harder like yeah it was like you know I was when I was tiny like I remember with my brother too you you know we used to go down to the park and make fucking sparkler bombs and then the bombs and you know chuck them into houses and or throw you know shit like just stupid shit you know but I'm like that's what I see with young people too it's just they do something at this level and then something that's you know around criminal activity then they have to find another high it's like a drug addiction you find that you're high you keep taking drugs you need to get higher so what do you do you either take more drugs or you take a heavier drug so that's like a challenge I feel relatable with young people they they do something small and then they get a bit of a high from that whatever they did then they want to go bigger and better or whatever so yeah but um yeah I just let's do with my personal story I did you know struggle with drugs pretty much my whole life I know just being just being open about it struggling with taking drugs I took my first ecstasy tablet when I was 18 and in the magnetic island and then I just from there it was every Thursday Friday Saturday pills everything you could think of but um you know I've really I've put to drugs you know like I I could have I believe I could have been a made it in Rugby League but because of the not being committed not focusing on you know that that that goal turn you know I turned to drugs and stuff like that that's a big big one for me like the the drug abuse now that I'm you know coming on the six seven months full sova it's a it was a one year plan to just I've committed that I'm not touching drugs anymore and I've committed to not drink anymore for 12 months but now it's starting to become like a two year three year plan because it's been six seven months and it's it's flying it's quite challenging at first but now it's easy because it's around I surround myself with like positive people and I'm engaging and as my time people that are there for me you And know. what's that feel like to have more groups of people around you that have a similar experience and starting to learn that there's a larger community of people that are like have a similar life story and a similar mission guess?\n- I Yeah it's good like you know meeting like yourself Benjamin, you know meeting the team from Confit, Leanne, you know Cameron Leon, like all these people that you know surrounded myself with like-minded people now that are you know that are we all we all share similarities of going through hardship at a young age or still going through hardship but how we've overcome that and now we want to provide programs or we want to be leaders in our communities yeah. But um what was the question again?\n- So what's it what's what's like community I guess like one context would be when you were younger you found like-minded people to hang around with yeah and you got in trouble. Yes. What's it feel like to be able to have a different context where you're finding like-minded people that now is directed towards helping those young people guess.\n- I Yeah it's um like uh it's it's uh what I say overwhelming because it's it's a it's a weird feeling when you hang around when you hang around people that are portraying and like doing getting up to mischief and fucking around and stuff like that and then you you know it's a bit of a high but it's in a negative way now I'm doing I'm hanging around people like like-minded that are want to talk about business they want to talk about self-development they want to talk about growth they want to talk about how can you become the best version of yourself that's my high now it's fucking mad like it's pretty pretty mad to be around people like that because um when I'm when I'm around anyone that wants to succeed and do it for themselves and for their families or for whatever like like it jeez me up and then you know that it kind of empowers it motivates me and empowers me to to do the same what's what do you reckon that that the comping of compounding like how do you create 100 brodies oh fuck that was pretty hard hey um yeah like I'm still very early in my journey with this you know I've been personal trainer for I guess six seven years and working in Aboriginal Health for seven years and as well as being a personal trainer I'm quite and then I'm only quite new to owning a gym you know being a gym owner for two years but um you know so I've got a lot I've got a lot of to learn I've got I'm going to surround myself with people that have been doing this for more than a lot longer than me and learn from them also you know gain feedback from you know community how I can become better personally and professionally but what was the question what how do we get more brodies yeah what's the pathway what's a similar pathway for young people that you went through I guess like and do you think that's possible or is everyone individual I think I think we need a I think the way my my business model is is that I can't do this alone you know that I'll I'll I'll collaborate collaborate with services and businesses um that are either doing similar stuff completely other stuff but um just showing showing communities that I'm trying to do my best for everyone to come together to support our our mob and also everyone in this community so you know little things like just working along working together um you know setting out if there's differences we'll set them aside because you know if I've got a difference with this person over here and we've got the same you know like when I say setting our differences aside sometimes we need to set it be selfish we need to you know like get a fucking get over it I guess and work together for the for that outcome yeah\n- Interview 210524\n- White one? Like pretty one? Any one. It's weird though, it's like it's a shit spot. I think these shirts are so high. I'll just put it there, on your seat belt. Yeah. Alright, they're starting the recording here. We're going to do a little experiment, drive around Mount Isa and talk to Brady Jermaine. About Mount Isa, about young kids, about crime and about what it feels like to be able to trial some programs, connections to culture, camping on country. My name's Benjamin Knight. I work at a curious tractor with old mate Nicholas Marchese. And yeah, in Mount Isa, talking with a few people about what Brady's trying to do. Just got out of a meeting with Child Protection and Youth Justice and some really great opportunities there to trial some ideas for some kids. So Brady, tell me about Mount Isa first. What's Mount Isa mean to you, feel like to you at the moment? And from your history in Isa, I guess. So I'm born and raised in Mount Isa. So I grew up here my whole life. I grew up here my whole life. So what Mount Isa means to me, this is home for me. I think being a small little community, it makes you appreciate the little things a lot more. You know, we don't have the access or the resources to do as much compared to other places. But, you know, I guess it's what you make of it. To describe Mount Isa, for people that have never really seen Mount Isa, you could say it's an outback town, surrounded by hills, a lot of four-wheel drives, and I'm kind of surrounded by spinifex. But also, you know, the culture here, you know, we have a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that live in the area. So, yeah, but I love Mount Isa. This is home for me and always has been. And, you know, I really love living here. Love working here. And the opportunities that are here, you know, I've taken and, you know, it's helped me become the person I am today, yeah. Tell me a little bit about your identity, I guess. Like, how do you identify and how is that connected to maybe even your mum and dad or siblings or whatever? And, yeah, how do you talk about your connection to culture or your identity? As a person? Yeah, so my mum was born in Mount Isa. But her, our tribe from my mother's side is, my mother's mum's side is Pita Pita, which is a little community a couple hundred k's outside of Mount Isa in Booyah Dajara area. So that's where my grandmother was from. And my grandfather was from Northern Territory. Catherine, he was born and then he grew up in the North Territory. And then he grew up in the Camel area. But I think back then everyone gravitated towards Mount Isa being like the hub of the lower Gulf and the inland communities. You know, a lot of the people that came to Mount Isa was, you know, either for hospital, you know, I'd say court system. And also the motivator would be alcohol and other drugs, which is unfortunate. But, yeah, like Mount Isa. A lot of Mount Isa people, yeah, like with the smaller communities outside of Mount Isa, we're all related in some way. We don't know how, but the old people can kind of direct us in that way. What's your identity? Well, yeah, my identity, I'm a proud Pita Pita Wakai man. So Pita Pita is through my grandmother. Oh. That's a whole other day. Yeah, so I'm a proud Pita Pita Wakai man. Pita Pita is through my grandmother, who was born and raised in Bolyar and grew up in the Bolyar Djarah area. And through my grandfather, Wakai, which is the border of the Camelwil, Northern Territory border. And my grandfather grew up, was born in Catherine and then moved to Camelwil. Lived there for years. Yeah. Years there before moving to Mount Isa. So that's my identity and, you know, that's something I was brought up and I knew a lot about my identity growing up. I was very grateful to have, you know, my mum who knew my identity that could teach me that. And now when I introduce myself to people and meet people, it's how I introduce myself and how I make other connections with other people. What about your dad's side? What's that feel like to you? And how's that part of your identity? So dad's Malaysian. He's a, my whole life I thought my dad was Aboriginal. Growing up, I thought he was a Murray fella. Just the way, the way he spoke, the way he taught me things, the way he acted. Until I think I would have been about 17, I mentioned him. I said, oh dad, whereabouts is your mob from? And he reckon, what do you mean? I said, nah, where you, like, where your mob from? I said, nah, where you, like, where your mob? Like, I know mum's side. What about yours? And he said, dickhead, I'm Malaysian. I'm not black. So I got to learn about dad's identity. Here I was telling all my schoolmates at the time. Yeah, my dad's Murray. He's from this area. I don't know where he's from, but I know he's Aboriginal. But this whole time he's a Malaysian fella. How's that feel like to you? Like, I guess, I don't know. Like, people probably get awkward talking about you. People probably get awkward talking about, like, mixed blood or kinship, whatever things. Is that something you've had to think about, work through? Or is it just normal for you, that sort of, like, mixed culture relations thing? Yeah, I think the word half-caste would always come up in a lot of conversation. Over the years I've learned, you know, there's no, I don't believe in percentages. I don't believe in half-caste, quarter-caste. If you identify as a culture, that's your culture. You know, whether that's, you know, if your mum's Aboriginal and your dad's Malaysian, you identify as you're Aboriginal and you're Malaysian. And also Australian, so. No, I haven't had much of that. That's cool. Um, Mount Isis gets an interesting bit of flack around youth crime and kids out of control. And drugs, now, Colin, stuff. What was your experience growing up in Mount Isis like in those respects? So, growing up I had, you know, really good parents that supported me in everything I did. Um, you know, always food on the table. I had a really good upbringing. My dad would, parents would spoil me because I was good at sports, so they'd take me away. For sports, always, I always went to school, even though I hated school. But I always had that good support network. As I turned, got into my late teens, that's, oh sorry, when I was about 12, 13, I think that's when I had a first sip of alcohol. And then from there I was actually sneaking out, drinking at a very young age, you know. And then from the alcohol turned into a lot of violence where we're fighting, getting up to mischief, doing, you know, stupid things that we were very lucky we got away with. Yeah. Um, but yeah, over the years, when I hit about, when I was 18, that's when I tried drugs for the first time. And I was playing footy out of rugby league school and had a really good opportunity and I kind of, I wouldn't blame the drugs, I'd blame my own actions. You know, my actions were, I chose to party, I chose to chase girls and do drugs over trying to pursue a career in rugby league. And, um, that's when I fell into that hole of, you know, partying, drugs, alcohol, then depression and then having all these mental illnesses that stemmed from the behaviours and the choices I made. Um, so that was a journey for a couple of years, you know, partying and all that, all that stuff. But, um, in the last couple of years, well the last year, that's where I've decided, you know, going sober. I did have one drink or two drinks in the last 10 months, but you know, not touching no harmful substances anymore. Um, the only harmful substance would be Maccas. Eating all this good food, I'm gaining all this weight. That's so good, so good. Why, um, what's your perception of the young kids, um, choosing negative behaviours in the community? Like, what's your perception of why they're doing that now as a broad, holistic type of reason? Yeah. I think these young people, they look up to the next old, the next person in their family that's older, or the next person in their network that's, you know, older or has a bit of, has that respect from others. So, it's like they want to try to prove themselves or try to fit in. But, um, yeah, the youth crime at the moment is quite high. But, you know, just talking today, you know, a lot of youth crime, it is quite high, but also domestic violence rates against women is higher. And it's not as talked about as much as the youth crimes and the stolen cars and all that stuff. Yeah, right. Um, just cruising up to a truck here on a very skinny road, um, heading out of town. Is that a stolen car in front of you, do you reckon? Yeah, that is. Okay. So, if we drive up to it, it'll probably, yeah, no number plates. We'll pull up, have a look. Tire's gone. Like, that's a really interesting example. Yeah, so that's... There's a, oh yeah, white, um, what is it, like a Holden type thing, you know? Yeah. Like, small, bit of writing over it. What, what do you think is part of the... Is it a thrill? Is it a, like, experience? Is it showing off? Like, that whole idea of stealing a car, like, what, where do you think that sort of, that behaviour comes from? Why? I think that's the, for a young person that isn't, doesn't know the effects of alcohol or drugs, doesn't know the feeling of being high, I feel that's their way of getting high, is being involved with criminal activity, getting involved in a crime, you know, and getting involved in a police chase or something they know deep down is wrong, but they like to test the waters and do it. I think that's their high, so I think that's why, why they seek it, because they, they, they do, they steal something from, say, the shop, no one chases them. Then they start to steal bigger things from a shop, security guard chases them. So they like that feeling of being chased and knowing what they're doing is wrong. Then they start to, you know, get bigger and, you know, they start to steal from people's houses. They get chased by the residents, then they steal a car, now it's becoming a police matter. So I think they're just chasing that next high and they don't know when to stop. And the only way for these young people to stop is they get caught, they get sent to juvie, but they love it in juvie. So it's a very hard one because all these young people, they, they're not scared of going to juvie. They're not scared of criminal behaviour or activity. They thrive off it. and when other young people see them doing this, they want to be part of this little, this group. So it's a circle that, it's a very hard circle that we're trying to break, but it's, you know, people like ourselves that are providing opportunities and pathways and being good role models and mentors and leaders in our communities to show these young people, you know what, it's okay to fuck up here and there, and it's okay to do this, but I'm here to help you making a better choice, and if it's day by day, it's day by day. You know, you've got to crawl before you walk. So, yeah, I think very hard-won youth crime, and I think it happens not only in Mount Isa, but happens everywhere, I guess. So I saw the other day there was a community safety report, and there's $1.2 billion or something that is on the side to reduce this idea of youth crime or... to give the community this feeling of, like, they're going to be safe because the police are going to, like, look after these young people through locking them up or through fining them or, like, through, like, increasing police. Yep. Like, it doesn't sit with me very well. Yeah. But that's obviously part of the process of, like, creating a, in inverted commas, safe community. Yep. What's the other side of the coin? Where we can create opportunities for the young people that are committing youth crime to feel, like, a sense of responsibility where they can, like, show the community that they can stop offending, that they can be a community member. Like, how do you bridge the gap between, like, arresting them because they're fucking up... Yep. ...versus... getting them to change their behaviour through, like, support... Yeah. ...and, like, options, I guess. I think what we're doing now is, like, that consistency of our work is, you know, the engagement of young people, providing a space like the gym where we, you know, open our doors for young people to come into the gym to talk to someone, to exercise, to be part of programs, you know, take them out on... taking young people out on country. Little things like that, I think, is probably... wouldn't say the answer, but is a key element to supporting young people rather than locking them up and, you know, locking them up and them sitting there with their thoughts, providing opportunity and pathways where, hey, you know, we're identifying that these young people's behaviour is wrong, but here are some tools and resources and programs that we can provide to help them to maybe... Yeah. ...to maybe... Yeah. ...to maybe... Yeah. ...to maybe... ...to make that change and hopefully boost them, their confidence to be like, you know what, I am fucking up. I am making the wrong choices, but I'm going to give this a go. Yeah, and I think it's really interesting, like, we just came out of a meeting and we were talking about, like, piloting something that would maybe cost anywhere between $30,000 and $50,000. Yeah. And the... Like, the overall understanding... Yeah. ...is that a young person costs up to $1 million to have a bed in detention. But if there's... If there's one thing I think that we can work through and have an understanding of is how do you bridge the divide between a government that wants to create a... ...and a safe community... Yeah. ...and the people that are voting them in... Yeah. ...want to feel safe and then still create this understanding of by offering a cultural engagement on country that's backed up with wellness... Yeah. ...connection and mentoring. Do you have an idea around how that could... ...that could happen? Or is it like... Yeah. ...is there a... Is there a way that you see that divide being bridged between folks in the city who are handing out money for programs and, like, that connection to country and actually going out and, like, hunting a kangaroo and cooking it up and... I think... ...fishing stuff? I think how do we, like, measure and how do we record it, I guess? Mm-hmm. It's a tricky one because when we spoke about it today, camping, like, connection on country involves, you know, being grounded, learning about your identity, your culture, you know, fishing, hunting, gathering. But people that don't understand connection to country sees that as going out bush. Yeah. See that as having a good time. But some people... We probably don't realize the cultural benefits and aspects around what... ...connection to country is. So it is a hard one to measure. But I think the best way for me to showcase what connection to country is and showing, you know, people in government that these things work, you know, is by inviting them out there and be part of it. You know, like, my vision is when I do these camps on country, I'd love to have workers from youth justice, child safety, the police, role models and mentors and community. People from education. People that haven't experienced what my camps are about. So I can showcase what these camps involve firsthand. That way they can come up with the measures and outcomes of, you know, what this camp was about. Because like we said, it's so hard to display what the connection to culture is on a piece of paper. How do you measure that? As an Aboriginal person, man, myself. I don't understand how that is. But I think the way for me to measure a young person, if their healing stages would be if I take them out of bush. And then when they return to community, they start to make some changes with their personal lives, with their family, the way they communicate, they listen. They try and get involved with, I don't know, local sports, school. That's the part of healing for me. So that's the stuff that I feel we can measure. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Like this, it's bridging the gap between a very natural feeling of being connected to something that is like a spiritual type idea. And then translating that over to a Western understanding of like a recidivism percentage or like reduction in risks of crime type thing. I think it's a really cool thing to dig into. Yeah. The other thing I was really interested in is like, when we start talking about that mapping stuff and like community things like in terms like community consultation or like approval processes or protocols and stuff like, have you seen anything written down ever around that stuff? And what do you think the opportunity is there for that? Nah, I haven't. What do you think is like, still culturally appropriate way to do that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you been in it, Addy? Oh. New spot. Right. You get some good footage out here. Oh. Okay, nice. Yeah, so I think when it comes to... of cultural protocols i think each um whichever area you're in you there's different you know so mount isaac is the calcaroon people um you know durmiji is ganglida garawa i believe burke town um you know so all these places um you know you're just making sure you're going going to see the right people but it's a you have to get it what is it how do you work this gate be dummy locked oh it's not very tech you know you dummy lock you're right i'll drive through and then just you'll like this spot yeah so what was the question uh what's it feel like you reckon to be able to explain to white fellas what procedure and protocol looks like and like in every grant yep it says community consultation cultural like what the does that even mean i guess for like um and like how is it like a tick in the boxing for white fellas right yeah but what's it what's the meaningful actual outcome or like the reason you do it i think being aboriginal is the first reason we do it is is respect is the first one is respecting our the people our ancestors our old people and the people in that area you know that have walked before us to give us these opportunities and passed their knowledge down so the first one is respect but also just knowing so in each area which you know going to the right traditional owners asking them what are the protocols what are the a route for this area what are the protocols what are the protocols.\n- What are the things we can do? What are the things we can't do? That's the easiest way to put it. But then actually doing it is, you know, if we go out to a certain area, hey, you know, you talk to the traditional owners, what are the things we can do when we go out on country? What are the things we can say? What are the do's and don'ts? You know, what's the history of this area? You know, what's this tree? What's the significance of this tree, of this waterway? What's the dream, you know, the totem? So there's a lot of meaning behind a place where we go, you know. So I think it is a hard one. Community, cultural consultation. Sometimes we do it without knowing we're doing it, I believe. Just by having that yarn, making connection with those people, they might make connection with you, know your family. So you're kind of already doing it without the language. Labelling it, I guess. But it is a cultural, what is it? Cultural consultation, sorry. Cultural consultation. I think as Aboriginal people, we do it naturally. You know, when you meet someone, hey, where are you from? Who are you mob? You know, who are your totem? Oh, I know where you're from, you know. So you start to pick up on those little things. But from a government perspective, that's, you know, like, you know, when we have to go for grants and stuff like that. So I think it's just linking up with someone or traditional owners that have done it before, linking up with the right people. Is there a way to do it where you could capture it and write it down and explain it? Or do you think that's inappropriate? No. To work through that? I think our elders in each respected community will feel proud that someone has actually asked them, hey, you know, what's the history of this area? You know, tell me your views of this, of views around culture. What have you experienced? Have you been part of Stolen Generation? I think our elders are really opening, willing to tell their story because like we say, storytelling is such a massive thing for anyone. And being able to tell your story without judgment and have someone to capture that is so powerful itself. So. The elders, they love it. We take some of the old people out to our camps with us and they took a year off because they're so proud that they've been able to revisit a place where they have a lot of memories with their parents, grandparents and it brings up a lot of emotions as well. So just as we're driving through here, it's amazing. So what is this called a particular thing? This is the granite mines. So you're on the right-hand side, there's like all of these like really cool like boulders that are around and stuff and then there's all of this like really interesting, like different grass land and bush sort of land on the left-hand side. What's, is there a significant historical significance of this journey? I think this is one of the biggest tourist attractions outside of Mount Isa. You try to fight for a spot out here when the sun goes down because it's really beautiful sunsets. A lot of people propose and it's a very romantic place but I think when I, like I don't know the cultural significance of out here but. I just know every time I come out here and you get to see the view shortly, it's beautiful like the landscape, you get to see Mount Isa from another lens, you know, we're surrounded by hills. A lot of people, you can actually climb up all these rocks. So, you know, to get a good view. Where's the best place for a piccy? Oh, right here where we're going. Oh, cool. Just chuck him in the forward drive. Wow, this is insane. This is like out of a movie. Oh, you wait till we go up here and we can climb up to these rocks. Oh. Sick. So painful. Just a bit of forward driving. Yeah. It's like I've been to the Devil's Marbles before, but that's a little bit different country, I think. Like different types of rocks or whatever. Hold on. Oh, this is good. This is a good fucking thing. One handed, one handed forward driving. Yeah, you're killing it. I'm very confident in your ability too. Alright. Really cool spot. You can get the camera. They got a good alright. Right, yeah. Just give a really quick look at the bottom of the rock and we can walk up there.

      "Transcript": "G Manari\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSpeaker: But cool. You talk to me. Yeah. This thing's not even there. \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure. \n\nSpeaker: So yeah, I think it's just say your name and what you do to start off and that's, yeah. Me start. Yeah. \n\nSpeaker 2: My name's g Manari, I'm from New Zealand. The Wato, my tribe is tiny. My mountain is my river is Waikato. My sub tribe is Nazi and I'm from New Zealand.\n\nSpeaker: What's it like coming, what's it like bringing yourself and your identity to another country? Like what, \n\nSpeaker 2: yeah. I think just from a cultural perspective we don't really bring anything but the posture of a visitor and a guest. So we have this concept of man. So Manu is guest and visitors.\n\nSo the, I think the the posture or the agenda is one of absolute humility. And that's a bit more exasperated when we're on sacred land inhabited by our traditional owners of this beautiful and [00:01:00] sacred land. And everyone else, a guests. So that's my posture. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Wow. Have you had a chance to hang with many indigenous community and do some protocols and welcomes and \n\nSpeaker 2: things? Oh yeah. I've been, it's been a prayer of mine actually, and a great hope and dream to, as a fellow indigenous from across the the ditch there. I was raised culturally, so I was raised by my grandma, and so we were raised with Tikanga, which is values and principles embedded.\n\nAnd us at a young age. It's always in our heart to lean towards something similar. And I've had a privilege to be involved with mob Belt in bin where and I was adopted there by a auntie out there, which is very sacred. I get invited back every year just to spend a bit of time with them and take young people and family and.\n\nThen I was able and really blessed to do life on baring gum country out in Bebe there where where our property is is being [00:02:00] looked after by some Roy people and yeah, which is very precious. So sat at the feet of elders and went on a mini little journey around South Australia to sit at the feed of Minnie and Alda with a sacred brother who I loved dearly.\n\nAng. And yeah, just to hear the stories, to hear the pain to sit in that space, to be invited to sit in that space of pain. And at the same time, hold hope for them, for myself, for each other as we yeah, as we do life together on these sacred lands. That's \n\nSpeaker: incredible, bro. What's your theory of how you engage with young people?\n\nDo you have a practice and how do you go about this? Is this something you've learned or is it something you feel, or how does that sort of work? \n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question, brother. I think the human experience a big part of that, I think being raised by my grandma a lot those principles and values that I've shared.\n\nActually forms us. And so what [00:03:00] forms us, we put that back out into the world as well. We have a awesome, or proverb in my language it's called\n\nkindness is sown, then kindness usually is received, and so that's been imparted in me most of my life and. Look, I haven't been perfect in it and made a lot of mistakes, so I'd probably say that's a part of the human experience as well. Actually learning from your mistakes and just knowing that, I think it gives us like that natural empathy, just to know that we've made a bunch of mistakes along the way and so yeah, we're not perfect and I was once a young person as well, making heaps of mistakes and yeah, that's probably my.\n\nMy heartened it all. I think I've gotta say too, my faith brother without my faith in Jesus, I wouldn't be the person. I am blessed to be a husband and a father that shaped them for me as well. And yeah. \n\nSpeaker: What's been some of those specific opportunities you've had to support young people over the [00:04:00] last little while?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so look I'm a chef by trade, like I've. Been cooking back in New Zealand and around the world for the last 24 years, and then it just fell on my lap. I was doing like an internship in church and got invited into juvie by a dear friend, and started doing prison chaplaincy there.\n\nLoved the community in there, loved the heart of the people in there. Felt the struggle that they felt, and, and I think some of the specific stories were birthed from that where I felt the struggle of my peers inside youth detention, they're wanting to do a lot more, but there's just this rigidity and legislation that it's actually quite harmful.\n\nAnd so I wanted to be more a part of the transition phase of young people coming out of youth detention. But I need to establish that trust and that connection. On the inside of juvie. So a lot of my stories have been ones of transition are helping to [00:05:00] transition our young people from being incarcerated back into ideally healthy communities.\n\n\nSpeaker: The government and funding and stuff always have these very like. Short snippets of what they wanna see recidivism, jobs, training, economy stuff. What's the real stuff that we should be measuring or supporting kids with? Like how do we best do this in a way where we're flexible to their needs rather than flexible to the public?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think it's, I think it's. Reminding ourself about the value of HU humans the value of HU humanity, and just pausing long enough to think, gee, I wonder with those young people, that the media is, has portraying them. And look, I'm not being insensitive to some of the harm that's been done a hundred percent.\n\nWe grieve that together as a community, but I wonder if the narrative would be different. I. If they came from a loving, supportive [00:06:00] family. If we look at the statistics of a lot of the stuff that has happened, like a lot of those individuals are coming from a lot of families that are fragmented and are disconnected from loving and healthy families as well.\n\nSo I think it's just being mindful that like sometimes not all of us get off to a good start. And that doesn't excuse like the. The tragedies that happened. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that as a community that I wonder if we focused on, in investing in that, that one small human that needs a lot more support than normally, 'cause dad might not be home, he might be locked up.\n\nMom might be in like, drug rehab or something like that. Which is like generally the case actually. These kids aren't coming from healthy families and so we, we need to adopt, I think a mindset of becoming that, that healthy family and community for them. If they don't have that.[00:07:00] \n\nSpeaker: So interesting that like the whole idea of rekindle was this village thing. And how do we continue to create that village that is like adaptable to. Not just like that individual's needs, but the whole family and then the community's needs, like there's a growing need, I think, to connect everyone in a young person's journey.\n\nYeah. Do you think that's possible? Or is that difficult thing to do to help the family and the young person at the same time? I think, \n\nSpeaker 2: yeah. I think we can start with thinking as a community, but I think we need to start thinking as. As individuals as well, like our own individual responsibility.\n\nAnd it, I heard a quote the other day, which is actually quite poignant to the question. It's like sometimes our young people see the village as actually harmful, so they'll burn the village down to feel its warmth. Wow. Sometimes our young people, they'll burn that village down 'cause they don't feel safe in it, just to feel [00:08:00] its warmth.\n\nAnd so I think what that says to me is that are we individually safe, approachable? Do we have the, do we have the agency to be to our young people that are going through this journey of life? Vulnerable and honest. And as a community, can we be honest and vulnerable to promote that place of safety for them.\n\n\nSpeaker: That quite effective. We've been talking about like incentive, what, like the kids especially, and we'll talk about like how you can create moments where of imagination and or. That brings into another place. Can you talk a bit about that? \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I've had the privilege to do life with the young people, and I think some of my strategies of how can I promote a healthy connection with a young person?\n\nThey, when they don't know me, who's this random guy? He's taken a, an interest in me. He's wanting better for me. That's what I want them to [00:09:00] feel. And us after we establish a healthy connection, then what's the next step for us in this journey together? As, as sometimes I could be perceived as a brother or sometimes even the kids have called me like, yo, you are like a father figure to me.\n\nI haven't had that, for me, I think deep friendships are beautiful. So that's my posture and I think. With all of us, how are those nurtured? And one thing I use is like presence and proximity. So presence and proximity consistently over time. It breeds like not for want of a better word, like intimacy in a relationship.\n\nJust not the word intimacy. It's a bit more of a romantic. Could be term, but that deeper kind of friendship. I would say, and so presence and proximity, like in a vehicle, you're side by side, you're having those conversations. I usually do that with a lot of my young brothers.\n\nWe we go in groups of two or three. We go and hang out in Noa [00:10:00] for a weekend. I've got this deal that I do with young people, if you are earning or learning or you work for six months or a year, we'll travel overseas. Had the privilege of taking people back to my home, these young brothers back to my home country meeting my family, going to Mara, cultural visits cooking with family being a part of tikanga practices taking a few young brothers to Japan a couple of times to, you're not thinking about stealing the car when you're looking at Mount Fuji brother, you're too enamored by the beauty, you don't want to, you wanna mess around. Had the, got the privilege of taking another young brother to New York, he's been in, in trouble for he's been in trouble for a long time with the law. A special task force was, was recruited to hunt this young man down. He's giving like them a headache, but he's come full circle and it's took taken presence in proximity over time to just say, mate, there's a better way. You don't have to, you don't have to piss people off to, to enjoy [00:11:00] life. And now he's actually going to New York this year.\n\n'cause it's always been his dream. Because he is a big graffiti guy, so now you can connect the dots, how he's been getting in trouble. But New York is the birthplace of everything. Hip hop. And graffiti's a part of that. So now that he's fully put that illegal graffiti stuff away and wants to do what's right we can reward him now.\n\nAnd we need to reward our young people, right? 'cause we lock 'em up for doing bad shit, man. But now we reward him if he, they're doing good things. So now he's been a part of facilitating youth camps. He's actually taught art. You know what I mean? And what I'm trying to say is all this stuff can be redeemed when we have the right heart because we know we're not perfect, but it's a posture of empathy.\n\nKnowing that our we're no longer where we used to be because people have invested in you and me \n\nSpeaker: so awesome. We're thinking about trying to tell some stories with young people. How do we do that in a [00:12:00] way that empowers them? And they feel like they want to do it because it's a making difference and it's like incentivized, but it's also relational.\n\nLike how do we do that in a way that's like real and gives them a chance to feel like it's worth it? \n\nSpeaker 2: I think it's a very great question and I think it's one of the most important questions. 'cause even from a cultural background, we would say that stories are so sacred, especially when they're personal and they're honest and they are vulnerable.\n\nAnd you can't put a price tag on that, but at the same time, you, not to be transactional, but we do want to be like deeply acknowledging that vulnerability in their storytelling. So I think the onus is on us as to, to offer what would be good for you. Like you are sharing your story.\n\nHow can we help you? As you are vulner, you are sharing your vulnerability. Like I shared, like that connection and that trust with me and the young person [00:13:00] is a great privilege. And it's happened over time. And I have done that. I have sat in front of a camera with young people and they have shared their story, and and usually they, oh, thank you for your time.\n\nHere's a voucher, and I just wanna say no. Fuck a voucher. My, my kids are all making money now. They're making upwards of 35 to 50 bucks an hour. Think about that. You know what I mean? Think about that. And it's not to, it's not to make that transactional, but it's like, how much are we really valuing that that, that story being shared, that's actually going, gonna transform family trees, brother?\n\nLike this story could potentially transform family trees. You know what I mean? And so yeah, I think that's a question for the, for that young person, I could add to that and give my opinion and it is fuck a voucher. Yeah. \n\nSpeaker: The other thing I'm interested in is people do make a lot of their whole life on making content [00:14:00] and a lot of that time they're doing that from a place of sharing their story.\n\nYeah. And yeah, I'd love to work out how you can almost find young people that are like in that frame of mind where they would like to use their story as a powerful tool. Yeah. And not share their story as a way for someone else to extract \n\nSpeaker 2: information. \n\nSpeaker: And yeah, maybe it's just like casting the net as wide as possible so that there's young people who are.\n\nExpressing interest because maybe they want to be a YouTube creator or maybe they want to be a story. That's great. So yeah. How do you do that in a way where you're not just like being like, your story was fucking horrific. We've gotta film this so that we prove something to someone else.\n\nYeah. That's that almost I think they call it poverty porn, but maybe it's justice porn or something. \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah it does have that. It can have that that, that sense of [00:15:00] exploitation and that, that's my fear for our young people as well. And 'cause we've seen it, right?\n\nWe've seen that happen. And it's not even about the monetary thing. It's having something as your personal individual story being so vulnerable, having that kind of like just blasted on the airwaves without knowing the ramifications of. Of, of your heart being out there. And you want your stories to be acknowledged in the right way.\n\nOf, yeah. There, there are young people out there that, that do have that heart and that posture too to share their story. So they're out there, but we just really wanna be. Super protective of their story and how that is, is shared and make sure that they know, like intrinsically that this is your story and it's not going to air without your permission and without your guidance and your governance, that's my. But at the same time, you've shared there's a beautiful way and a powerful way that this is gonna be helpful to our [00:16:00] young people and our community out there to understand and to help our young people know that there is a better way. And I've talked to a lot of my young brothers and they're actually super keen to do that.\n\nAnd look, they'll do it. They'll do it 'cause they've, they'll do it because they've been surrounded by people who deeply love them and care for them. And they, their heart would be, we want our other young people that were in my shoes to feel that care and love. And we don't want them to miss out that there is a people you know that actually deeply care and it's okay to share your story because they need to get it out as well and to be heard the right way.\n\nYeah, you're right brother. \n\nSpeaker: Yeah. And I think as we progress. I'd love to be able to work out how they know that there's a community of people who are supporting them as they're sharing that. And yeah, there's Kate and yourself, and there's Amanda, and then there's all these people that when they hear that story, it touches them in a way that like expresses pride.\n\nYeah. Confidence. Yes. [00:17:00] Like visionary stuff. And always, even like having a place like the shed where they can feel like this is their space. And they can start to fuck with shit and be like, oh, we need a PlayStation there, and we need a fucking couch there. Yeah. TV there. And yeah. How do you build that village where they're dictating who they want to hang out with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's an important one. I think. I think you nailed it. I think just giving options and just being around. Like hope filled people Yeah. Actually fills you with hope. You know what I mean? Yeah. And that's what's happening here at the shed. And yeah. With Kate, with their work there and Amanda and Rekindle, Hoya, Luke, all these, and the neighborhood family out there.\n\nAnd, we bang we, I have banged on about the government, but, and I'm not talking about the people in there 'cause you and I both know there, there's some beautiful people in there. And they're more like the they're like the hardware of the out outfit, but it's the actual software that's actually [00:18:00] dictating, the rigidity of.\n\nWhat our young people are dealing with. But yeah, I just wanna say, that in insider do have some relationships in government that have been very, and you as well, that have been very necessary to get this stuff across the line. But it's finding those in there. That have the scissors, you got some real sharp scissors, bro. And they, and if they want to meet those outcomes, they just whip the scissors out and there's no more red tape because they actually, humanity actually matters to them. And they know that outcomes, and I've known people, bro, that have lost their jobs for whipping the scissors out.\n\nAnd at the end of the, at the day, they haven't been acknowledged because those people that have whipped the scissors out, yeah, they might have been not been following legislation because of a certain risk assessment or what, but they were filled with so much hope and now that young person's not in jail anymore.\n\nThey know what I mean, and they've lost their job. But hope transcended like the [00:19:00] rigidity of the red tape. And I think my message in that would be to those people that are in there is that you gotta follow your heart in this human services space. 'cause we, like you and I have discussed, we've monetized human care.\n\nYou know what I mean? We'll pay a dollar value to actually caring for our fellow human. Where what do we do when the money's not there? That's my thing, are we still gonna have the same heart when the money dollar value's not there? You and I are sitting here today 'cause that's our heart.\n\nYou know what I mean? And so that, that'll be a good thing to for us to explore together. As well. And it's about, lifting up, like you said, brother, that, that community that ecology of people with kindred spirits to actually. Care in the space. And like I'm saying, like in government, there are people that care, but they're bound, aren't they?\n\nThey're actually restricted by actually what they can do 'cause of the software that they engage. So [00:20:00] \n\nSpeaker: I'm gonna take that software thing. That's all right. I'll use it. Yeah, \n\nSpeaker 2: sure. \n\nSpeaker: Russ. Well done. \n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome, bro. \n\nSpeaker: Is that all right? \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No, that's all good. Good. Yeah.\n\n",

They brought me down here and the machine, Colin was, he started his fistula up here, that fistula hit me in line in the side of my chest and I held it today in Perth. I had to stay in Perth for a long time. I was getting homesick in Perth. A very busy place. Strange people. But I made friends with them. Because I was staying in Autumn Centre. I stayed there for a long time, then they found a room for me down here and calculated a tree to be keep so they put me in the train. I was happy. I came to Trilby, stayed there, lived round and round, went to the resort, stayed, and came back. And now you stay out here, how would you describe this place to someone that hasn't been here before? It's a good, quiet place. I enjoy staying with the ladies here, whether a big fire would. And why is staying with those ladies important to you?

Do you think it's important to be able to wash your mattress? Because it's hard to do it. Plus, I'm disability, I can't wash my mattress. Yeah. It's hard. Do you normally sleep by yourself or with other people? I'd rather sleep by myself. Yeah. But at the moment, how many people are sleeping in your tent? I've got my own bed in my toilet.
