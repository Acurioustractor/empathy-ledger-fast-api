        "# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n"

Well, we call them, we call them really, really, really good and with our culture and our, our, our culture and our, our connection, how we keep our connection strong here today and how, how we live in Nan Creek. I haven't really had a chance to interview anyone that's specifically helping Outra from Willy Jura.\n\nCan you gimme a little short, what is it? Oh yeah. Willy Gunter. Yeah. It started backboard nearly 20 years ago with me and Simon and. The way I used to live at Utopia and how Simon used to live straight across in the doctor's house. He used to live in the doctor's house, and I used to live across the road in the old tin shed.\n\nNot very big, [00:04:00] very small. One PowerPoint, one tap. And Simon had a big flash house. And then he said to me one day and he said, look mate, one day I am gonna build you a house. And I reckon, oh, in your dream mate. And then 20 years later we. We, we, we are there now and then we started a project, get a get get will down.\n\nThat's how I got Will, will. And he asked me, what shall we call it? Well, I said, you know, to us standing strong in Rimu, we call it Will actually, but we cut it short. Now we call it means standing strong in one. Yeah. Such a good explanation. Um, what's your, what, what do you see as your role in, in this, in this?\n\nWell, I reckon me, I want to see a better future for our kids and better housing for mb brandy people, not only here and for people, [00:05:00] for the whole nation, for everybody around the country. You know, we're all struggling today for housing and so, so we started. I started Will Gun with, with Simon, and now today we've got, we got a good, good team of US Mob working now with Willar.\n\nAnd because I, MEIA and my Mrs. Serena, she, the ones helped me, supported me all way along with, with Simon and especially with me and. Always been there with me and try to try, try to get things going. And so here we are today. Now, you know, we we're a, we've got a project and we've got a got a, you know, business going now and hope, hopefully we waiting for this first house to be built for me out, um, out on my block.\n\nAnd if we, once we get that going, it'll be like an display house. Like these people in Sydney. They've got, they've got these houses in Sydney to people to go and have a look at. But this one is gonna be for all brandy [00:06:00] people. You know? It is not only for us here today in Nan Creek, it's for everybody, for all different tribes.\n\nAnyone can come along and have a look and it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be very culturally and properly so that. People can have a better way of living and something change. We don't want, we don't wanna go. We don't want to live backwards, like how we grow up. We grew up back in the seventies and eighties and back in the nineties it was pretty rough at them times.\n\nNow we want to see better way of living for our people and our kids and better life. Why? Why do you think it hasn't happened before? Like it's a big issue? Well, I think, I think the government didn't work and the architect didn't work with us. And collaborate how we wanna live and how we wanna, how we want our houses.\n\nNow we got our, we've got our own ways sold so that now we can collaborate with our own people, not only here. It'll be everywhere. [00:07:00] What's, and a lot of people got different culture, different way of lifestyle, and our cultures are all different. So. If you're gonna work with the next, with the next community, with the next mob people, you gotta make your work with them and ask them how they want it.\n\nThat's just the way how many people work. And you don't walk into a community until you talk to the traditional owners and the S so that you can work and talk to what, what do you think the outcome is for the next generation coming? Well. Uh, me, I wanna see in the next, next 10 years, later on, next 10 years, I wanna see changes.\n\nI wanna see my kids leading William Guna and I take over and my grandkids as well, you know, because I'm just, to some, I'm just opening the gateway for them. Something that they can have something to work on. And. Work [00:08:00] with the country and with, with Bombi people around, around in the Northern Territory especially.\n\n'cause we, we, we, we found it hard here in the territory, back in from the flour and sugar and tea days working in stations and living in the on stations. And then when everybody got their rights back, back in 1977, then you know, we all got kicked off the station and sent back into town, then got dumped in town.\n\nNow we are here in town, we. We live in the way the government wants us to live now and, and put us in these houses. They just say you're getting a house, but you don't really own that house. That house belong to the government. Yeah. Um, partnerships are hard sometimes. How have you maintained good partnerships with Simon?\n\nWell, I don't mean him get on really with that fella. Well, you know, we've been mates for a long time. He, well, when I first met him, he was only a young, young fella from Sydney and, you know, he was a little city boy. Every time I used to take him out Bush, [00:09:00] I always tell him, Hey mate, he looked like you're suffering as Simon.\n\nWhat, what, what, what do you like? And he would say, I'm all right. And I, and I always say, you know what, if I was you, you know where I would've been right now. And he would say, where? I always say I would've been back there. I would've been sucking on an ice cream or looking on ice cream and staring at that bridge back at Sydney.\n\nThat's what I always say to Simon, and I still did use that today on him sometime. Yeah, he come from a long way, that fella. And how do you, how do you bring new people in and who, well, we bring new people in. We, we, we. We work 'em out how they are. If you can work along with them many people or government, that's good.\n\nFrom Brady, I believe you. We all should be walk walking together. It's like these two snakes. My logo got here, the logo, it come from my country. It come from a totem, from a place called Jim Cargo, and [00:10:00] that's why I use this logo today. It's not only from today, it's a thousand billion years old. Desire. My old people used to put this on Shields on the ground.\n\nAnd now we've got her on shirts. We've got 'em on everything now, now letterheads. So, you know, it's, it's, it's flying really quick. Mm. Um, what do you think this idea of sharing knowledge means? Not just from an Australian perspective, but around the world? Like, what, what does that, well, that's the only way you, it's, it's, well, when we live in new technology today, it doesn't take much to get that message out there.\n\nIt's only you, only you only, you only can get interviewed here, like now, today, you know, that'll, that'll be out there one day and then, then, then that'll be passed down to the next generation. Not only we keeping it today, it'll be passed on from, from my kids to their kids, to their kids after them. So that's why it's really good to document everything now [00:11:00] while we can.\n\nWhat a crack in sunset we've got going on here. Yeah, mate. It is. I reckon it's beautiful. That's my own. How much does nature play in the design of Willy Hunter's building? Well, it works with, with the climate. We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we work with the climates and the way how we sleep and how do we move around in the house with our people, with our poisons and our mother-in-laws and our father-in-laws and our son-in-laws.\n\nIt's, it's an everyday life. From us and we gotta learn to adapt to it and try to work around it and try, try and make us all one. But, but our culture, we have to still keep our culture. Our culture is very important to people. Without your culture, I feel, I feel I feel lost with my strong. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.\n\nI was gonna ask, like you seem like you have a very strong [00:12:00] presence and focus and passion. What, what's helped you get to who you are today? Well, my passion is my kids shooter and my future, my. My next generation so that they can see. That's why I always, well, you know, we, we, we always, we always have our, have our ceremonies.\n\nThat's just how our ceremony been passed down from, you know, from generation to generation. I like to see something of me getting, you know, interviewed like this now, like here today to pass that down to my next generation so they can see what I'm talking about. Your partner's over here trying to wrap us up should rouse on him because, oh, this fellow is telling us bigger.\n\nYeah. Oh, Simon, I think we need to do round 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 maybe. What, every time I come back we should do another catch up because. [00:13:00] Somebody else doing that as well. Amazing. Even, um, NITV. Oh yeah. It doesn't, they, they've been done doing a few now even they'll follow us right down to Canberra when we went there working for our first funding.\n\nCool. Yeah. So awesome to yarn. I'd love to keep it going. Oh, that'll be good. Yeah. So when the next time you'll be back Yeah. We're, we're back in June. June. June, yeah. Yeah. And then, um, yeah, we should be here every quarter or so. Reckon. Yeah. Yeah, I, I do a lot of work in Alice Spring, so. Alright. No worries.\n\nThank you. Thank you brother. You way. Oh, I'll grab this father off you. Oh yeah. Otherwise I'll take it home. I've had a few people take them home. Yeah. I keep having to buy new ones.\n"

        "Freddy Wai - Friend - James St\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I'm just basically been homeless , I'm a refugee from Papua Newa. Finally got my Visa last year, May 2nd, 2024. That was 16 days before my birthday, and it was a blessing year. And now I've been living in.\n\nAustralia for six months or something now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's life been like for you, I guess for the last little bit in Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh, I think Australia is the most beautiful country in the world, and I think Melbourne. Yeah, definitely is a beautiful place. Yeah, I've been in two places only that's in.\n\nDanon and Brook, the Sunshine Victoria in Melbourne. And I like it. Yeah, [00:01:00] I like both places. Yeah. But I became homeless just seven weeks ago seven months ago. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's that experience been like for you?\n\nSpeaker 12: It's been challenging and I think it's rewarding too at the same time because I learned a lot of things I lost a lot too.\n\nBut there's a challenging part is losing a lot of friends. You are losing trust in everybody, especially the government. And then you tend to wanna blame and point fingers at, others. But at the end of the day, I think everybody deserves a place to sleep, place access to, water and electricity.\n\nAnd as for me, as a refugee. [00:02:00] Who seek for asylum in here. And I came and I got, they gave me asylum. I think these rights, I have to acknowledge that I need to make myself work harder to find another accommodation for myself. So I have a, shelter and. Electricity, water and all this.\n\nYeah. Otherwise, I'm not a human being, I cannot, I have to work harder to do this. Yeah. To find a house to live in. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 13: What was life like in, in Fiji before you came?\n\nSpeaker 12: Life was very hard. I think it's harder than. It is very difficult, harder than what I've harder than what I've experienced in my life in here.\n\nBut I've seen other people in here [00:03:00] too who are homeless who I think they face it harder than even in my country. I think my country is easier. In here, it's very difficult because it's twofold. You can see the good and the bad, but that's advantage and disadvantage from me leaving my country and from me living in here.\n\nLike in my country, you don't look at the clock. You don't really be punctual in Australia it is different. It's very difficult because the homeless people and all this, they're struggling because why they have to be punctual and pay fees and all these things and all, especially when they don't have job and all this is more difficult.\n\nYeah. But in my country, the only thing is the violence is the scary part. Yeah. The violence is, yeah. [00:04:00] There's no limit. That's the thing. So it's extreme violence. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 13: what made you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Since we got my country got independence from Australia in 1975. After that, only like my parents. They're like citizens of Australia because they were born before we got independence, but they don't get recognized for that. They haven't got a, their citizenship or anything for me. Yes. I was born after 1975. I can get a, I can't get a, passport and all this fight for my rights to come here, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMy parents fight for the right to come here too, and then I fight for my right to come here. It doesn't make sense to me. It is no common sense, but it's all right. God put the law in for some reason. I don't know. We'll work it out later, but I think it's not right. It's not right because if you are born in a country while it's still Australia, [00:05:00] you are a citizen of Australia automatically.\n\nAnd I thought it was only my parents, but I find that, half of the Korean mob and the Torres Strait Islander mob and all the ma everybody, most of the aboriginals, they don't have the citizenship too. So I think we are all in the same boat. So there's nothing to, what was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 13: Why did you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh yeah. Why I came to Australia? Yeah, because I know this this. My mother country, this is my homeland. This is my mother country, so I still have right to come here. But I didn't come. All my family and everybody, they came here before maybe 1997. Even, I don't know if I were, when I was younger, I came, I don't know.\n\nI can't remember because a lot of traveling. Around the country within PNG and here too, but I can't remember most of [00:06:00] it when I was younger. I only, the only thing I can remember is from 1993 up, when I started going to school. Yeah. After that there were a lot of tribal conflicts in my village.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So my parents have been like, they're basically like vol, voluntary workers. They're born again Christians. My father was a heavy diesel equipment fitter, and my mother was a principal at one of the secondary high schools in p and g, and then she became a community office officer for the mining company in my country.\n\nYeah. And she got some more degrees on top of her teaching and all this, and she. Yeah, she's basically the breadwinner of my family.\n\nAs a result, inherited a lot of land [00:07:00] back at home because most of my family, they come and grow up here, so my sister and my brother, and my mother's sister. So because of my land titles, my life is in danger. Because I received land royalties. Yeah. So they want to kill me. I had to take myself out of my country.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm the first born in my male in my country. In my family. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the situation daily for you in Australia now? What's the main things in which you're working on or working towards, or what do you do today?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah the first thing I'm working on is basically to get to know the people.\n\nKnow the system here, the street, the bus service is very difficult because if you grow up here, you can instinctively make decisions like what to do, where to go, what number to go. It is not like that. Every day I wake up to check the number again, [00:08:00] because I'm not sure which bus I'm getting on.\n\nAnd I keep on asking the traffic officers and all this, and the people here are very helpful and very, I think Australia is Australian and the community in Melbourne especially, they're good people. They help a lot. Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 13: Are you using the Sky Service? What do you think of Orange Sky and what they're doing?\n\nSpeaker 12: I think orange sky, I've seen it where in, on TV and all this. And I think I really appreciate the work they do and yeah, I highly recommend the people who fund and support these services. Yeah. God bless you all, like you, you got a heart, heart of gold and I really appreciate your support for the sky orange. People, I'd like to be a volunteer too, to help wash the clothes for like this, but I'm not sure how it's gonna work because that's the only thing. I have. The trolley, if you can take the picture there it [00:09:00] is. Just the trolley there. Yeah.\n\nThat's my only problem because\n\nI never been in Australia, homeless in winter, but summer is all right. That's why I take a lot of clothes there in there. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 13: And what's why do you think like this idea of connection and being able to talk to people is important?\n\nThat's part of what Orange sky does. Why is, why do humans need other people and other people to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think because it's very lonely world for me. For me, I think I'm lonely. I'm lonely maybe because. I enjoy other things and all this. Maybe I'm not I don't have a partner, that's why I'm lonely or something.\n\nBut I'm straight just for information looking for a girl. I have some of my partner ex-partners back in p and g, but since I come here, I have to start a new life, but it's very difficult for me. I can't get over it. Yeah. Like starting a new life here. Yeah. Yeah, I still have [00:10:00] my family back at home.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's like some things in which you do to connect with people in Australia\n\nSpeaker 12: In Australia, basically, I just most of the time I just say hello to people, meet them on the road. But sometimes I drink drink alcohol once in a while, and when I drink, I feel more open to speak to people and yeah, I meet a lot of people here.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 13: do you meet a lot of other people that are not from Australia and do you connect in that way as well or do you make most\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I meet a lot of people not from Australia and Yeah. But I'm very curious about the, how the real Australian, like how the Australians are. The culture and all this, how they speak and all this.\n\nI try to follow, learn the accent, the lingo. But I think if they speak in the ling the slangs I don't understand. They, I seen a lot of, when they get to the, they start using [00:11:00] the slangs and all this, they know. Yeah. And it's a different level. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it, but I understand.\n\nYeah, I understand. That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the next sort of steps for you? What do you wanna do next?\n\nSpeaker 12: The next step for me is after I understand the system, I'm gonna be like, five years. Five years I won't work because that's, I promise that already, because five years, actually seven years I fight for my visa, and finally after seven years, I got it.\n\nSo seven years I will stay. I am like a, a baby, newborn baby. I'm still growing. When I become seven years old, I will understand what to do and then I will start working there.\n\nYeah. I will start working after seven years, but now I'm so mentally tormented because I've been institutionalized and I tried working.\n\nI was working with the [00:12:00] brick laying and all these things. I just walk one day. Yeah. But I couldn't I'm a process technician. Even just fixing a bicycle. I can't do it. I try to change the wheel, change that tube. I can't do it because I can't concentrate. It takes like over two to three hours just changing the tire.\n\nSo I've been mentally affected too. Yeah. I got stabbed here. Two times here. Two times here, two times here. I'm a victim of one punch coward assault. Yeah. They punched me here too. And I fell down. Actually I was on the balcony and they punched me and I fell down because I was dead drunk, so I fell down and the cement broke my jaw.\n\nI got four screws here. Four screws. Yeah. Yes. From my fractured jaw. And then I got hit by a, I got hit by a [00:13:00] car. It's like it was lady, she stopped by the traffic light. I was coming on a bike trying to go and do a inspection. House inspection. Yeah. I come and then there was green light was on. And then she stopped.\n\nAll the cars went and she stopped. And so I took off. When I took off, she took off again and she hit me again. And then she hit me. I went to the air five meters up, landed on my head, bro. Yeah, to my ligament, spine, ligament. And then what happened was the police come to question me, take me to the hospital in all.\n\nI said no, it's all right. It's not her because she was a Muslim lady. She just pick her children and she was crying too. So I feel sorry. Like I said, no she didn't do anything. And then I woke up and I went to the hospital myself. Yeah. And that's another that's the third incident I got.[00:14:00]\n\nSo I got a lot of injuries when I came to Australia too. Yeah. Yeah. What's, what other\n\nSpeaker 13: services do you use at the moment? What are the types of things in which,\n\nSpeaker 12: I use the sender link. I use the Salvation Army, I use the library for shower, and whenever I want to do a like con. Do internet, like search some things.\n\nFree wifi. I go to the library. I even use the console wifi sometimes when I don't have data. What else do I use? I use the bus services and the train services. Most of the times I don't have the, my key, but I think the officers I used to miss understand. But they're really there to help me. Yeah.\n\nI think. Yeah. Yeah. What,\n\nSpeaker 13: and what other things do you think would be helpful for you if someone was to be able to support? What are Yeah. Are most [00:15:00] important?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think I would need support to, at least get a job. I really need support to get a job and a house like I'm mentally affected.\n\nI had a mental, independent, psych mental health psych assessment by a doctor, and he found out that I was mentally impaired and he is put a no enough in claim for my compensation. And he says, admit that, but I don't want the money because I don't know how to budget because mentally affected, I can't even work.\n\nBecause I get paranoid, I don't trust anybody. I don't even trust myself. The only thing I trust is I'm praying to God every night or something to gimme some, yeah. But yeah, sometimes I go crazy. Yeah, I try to take things in my own hands, but in my heart I know what is against my religion and I try not to do it.\n\nDo [00:16:00] it a lot, get angry at someone or get violent or something like that is no good. And I'm trying to learn how to live here. Yeah. But it's overwhelming because the culture shock. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it'll be all good. Yeah. Thanks to people like you and the Orange Sky team and all this, I think we are blessed to have, people who do this work and who support us like this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Done.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. All right. We're gonna do."

        "Pamela Ramsey - Vol - Foothills\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 15: The main thing is that your cool. So all you have to do is tell me your name and first name and last name, and spell it. Okay. And you can talk straight to me. That's, that's just weird. Okay. I'm\n\nSpeaker 16: Pam, PAM, or Pamela Ramsey. R-A-M-S-A-Y from Melbourne, obviously. What else do you need to Oh, spell it? Uh, yeah.\n\nR-A-M-S-A-Y. Amazing. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Tell me a bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 16: Well, I am. I'm nearly 70 years old. Hmm. Don't like saying that out loud. Um, I'm retired. I've been retired for a few years now. I'm widowed. I, my husband died a long time ago. Uh, I've got two grown up daughters and four grandsons. Um, so when I retired, um, I'm actually, I'm involved in a charity in Bali.\n\nUh, where we run a, I'm a massive animal lover and we run a des sexing [00:01:00] program for dogs and cats. And when Covid hit. I couldn't travel to Bali. I couldn't do any fundraising here, so I looked, I'd just retired. So I looked around for basically something to fill my time because Covid destroyed my retirement plans.\n\nMm-hmm. Um, and I found these guys on the website. I think I Googled volunteering opportunities or. Something like that because I didn't want to work with food and I didn't want to work in an op shop. And I went, oh, that looks good. And here I am, not quite four years later, I do usually twice a week. Um, yeah.\n\nSo good to be able. I love it. I love it here. It's, um, it's friendly. I live quite close to here and I actually know. Some of the people that come here, I see, oh, I don't really know them, [00:02:00] but I run into them in the shops and we have a chat and um, it's, you know, it's nice. It's a very homey sort of community around here.\n\nA bit different to some of the other challenging places that I travel to. Some of them are a bit more challenging than here. Here is very easy, very friendly, as you can see. Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Awesome spot.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, um. Um, is there something that's changed in you from starting to volunteer to now in terms of like maybe what help is or what homelessness is or anything around those types of things?\n\nUm,\n\nSpeaker 16: yeah, I think, I think, I think there, well we do, we do in here and we come across quite a few genuinely homeless. People, there's a lot of people living in their cars. Um, a lot of people live up in the mountains in the national park. Mm-hmm. You know, they'll [00:03:00] pitch a tent somewhere quiet up there. But most of the people that we deal with here, and also at Dandenong, where I go quite a lot, are not really homeless, but more disadvantaged and being able to help, you know, even if it's just your.\n\n10 or $15 a week to go to the laundromat to come here, I think makes a huge difference to their finances. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, I'm fortunate enough that I don't have to live on a tiny little pension, but, you know, it, it's a tough gig, um, especially for people who've gotta pay rent, doesn't leave them with very much.\n\nSo a lot of the people, they come here for a meal. They might come here for meals, they'll get their washing done, they go somewhere else tomorrow night for a meal. A lot of them travel to three or four different places through the week. Um, [00:04:00] which, you know, obviously helps out. Um, so yeah, I, I think let, there's, well, don't get me wrong, I, I'm not saying that there's not an issue with homelessness because there most certainly is, but, um.\n\nCertainly around here. Uh, it's not as much as I thought it would be, or they're just not coming here. There are, there are lots of, still lots of homeless people around here. There's a couple of guys that I see sitting outside the supermarkets and stuff that I never see come here. You know, I stop and have a chat to them and tell them about this place, but they don't want to come.\n\nA lot of them don't. They wanna be just left alone. Mm-hmm. Um, so yeah. Yeah. So I guess in that way it's, it's changed.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, I'm really interested in this idea of like, what is a story and how do people tell them? What's the idea of stories around the van, I guess? And are those stories powerful for you, for the people that come?\n\nOh [00:05:00] look,\n\nSpeaker 16: what's that like? Well, I think, uh, a lot of the people that come here look on us as their counselors. Um, we get told lots of stuff that probably don't. Need to know. Um, and, but it, it's good. I love it that they're comfortable enough, people are comfortable enough to come and tell us their troubles.\n\nUm, yeah, I mean obviously I'm not gonna share the stories that they tell us 'cause it's their, their stories. But, um, yeah, we do, we do hear lots and I'm sure they'd be happy to tell you. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: And what's, what's, where, where do you think that role of the volunteer is most, you know, more important? Like,\n\nSpeaker 16: well, it is definitely as a pseudo counselor, as well as, and, and a lot of the people that come here, uh, especially don't get their washing done, but they still come out and have a chat and, [00:06:00] you know, tell us their, they tell us their troubles.\n\nThey tell us the good stuff as well. Um, yeah, so. Uh, yeah, I think, um, certainly there's, there's certainly more to orange skies than doing people's washing. Um, and you know, we've become quite close to, to the point where if they're not here, I worry about them, which Steve in there always says, don't worry.\n\nThey, they come back. But I'll go home and worry about where, you know, somebody that I think is a bit vulnerable is if I don't see them the following week. Mm. Um, I've probably got better at that over the, over the four years. Yeah. Don't lay awake at night as much as I used to. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Um, what's been part of growth or enjoyment or whatever for you for this?\n\nLike what, what, why do you keep coming back? Oh, personally,\n\nSpeaker 16: [00:07:00] uh, look, people volunteer for all sorts of different reasons and, um, you know. Some of the volunteers that I've met, some, some of them do it to get hours on a uni degree or on a course or something. Some do it. I, I grew up in a family. We volunteered.\n\nI was brought up to always give back. Um, my mother was a doer, you know, she was involved in, she was one of those ladies that did that, did the flowers, and polished the brass, and she was a girl guide leader and. It's just, I don't, I don't know. It's just a thing I've always, I've always done. And once I retired, I was able to do more of it.\n\nAnd as I said, covid, I probably wouldn't have done it without Covid 'cause I would've just continued doing my, um, barley gig. Um, but I had time on my hands and I'm not good at having time on my hands. I have to fill my [00:08:00] time. Sure. So, yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, volunteering's just what. You know what people do, you, people either do, they're either a giver or a taker, I guess, but you know, and personally, you, you know, you, it makes you, it makes you feel good to help people, um, makes you feel good inside to know that you've helped somebody.\n\nYou are even, you know, just, and, and some people are so grateful to have their washing done. People who are genuinely homeless and you're able to give them. Especially in winter, you know, a nice basket of nice folded, clean, dry, nice smelling, washing makes them feel really good. So it makes me feel good.\n\nThat's really it. So\n\nSpeaker 15: awesome. Yeah. So good. Hey, I'm just gonna take a photo.\n\nSpeaker 16: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 15: I reckon I can do it like this."

And we've become quite close to the point where if they're not here, I worry about them, which Steve in there always says, don't worry.\n\nThey come back. But I'll go home and worry about where, somebody that I think is a bit vulnerable is if I don't see them the following week. I've probably got better at that over the four years. Yeah. Don't lay awake at night as much as I used to. .\n\nPeople volunteer for all sorts of different reasons and some of the volunteers that I've met some of them do it to get hours on a uni degree or on a course or something. Some do it. I grew up in a family. We volunteered.\n\nI was brought up to always give back. My mother was a doer, she was involved in, she was one of those ladies that did that, did the flowers, and polished the brass, and she was a girl guide leader [00:01:00] and. It's just, I don't know. It's just a thing I've always done. ~And once I retired, I was able to do more of it.~\n\n~And as I said, covid, I probably wouldn't have done it without Covid 'cause I would've just continued doing my barley gig.~\n\n",

        "Dianne Stokes - all\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nDianne: My full name is Dianne Stokes. And I'm a local, I'm a traditional owner and where I live is where it's in the boundary of my totem and I. Been here for really 24 years, but almost 24. It's 23 years. Dianne Okay. Without shelter, just living here, having the only thing was my shelter when I first moved in was my car, my little car.\n\nI felt good, but I felt scared because of rain. Wind. Heat was to go under them. Big trees down there? \n\nNothing here. When I first came here, just the grass and trees and lizards and everything else. Insects. And what does this country mean to you? It means to [00:01:00] me, it, it means to me something that really makes me happy and it's every time I go away from here, it's like it's calling me. Come back home. And I do feel that I want to, when I get home, I feel happy I'm at home. \n\nWent through this town and my father's, it carries on from father's to father. That's why I resided here because I wanted to stay here. Where it's close enough for me to be in town for shopping and that, and for work and and for the kids to go to school.\n\nBut I was living out in a community where my grandfather's country, my mom's country, I was living there. It was good because I went back to reside there. All my fam, all my family's passed away, [00:02:00] so I wanted to go back and liven up the place. With my families and still wanting to come back here. When I come back here, I know I got no one to tell me what to do.\n\nIt's my home and I've got it registered last year. So it's the place is registered. Is it I wanna have a, in the back where the corner of my, boundary. I wanna have a cultural area there, cultural center, and a youth center. That's what I'm planning to do, where I can have day, daytime kids coming to do their homework if they're not going to school.\n\nThe kids who are in trouble with the police and they have them devices on their legs sometimes that I'm not going to school. Where it's free outside for them to do their homework and do activity like making organic garden or doing painting or doing something out here, [00:03:00] making them live enough because it's outside, there's no houses around.\n\nThey've got a little place where they can do their homework during the day. What do you think kids need at the moment? It needs the house. I need a place where, like a office and a building where the kids do the activity and cultural center at the same time where I can have a building kids go in there, do cultural works, like making bush medicines and doing weaving or something like that.\n\nAnd at the same time having game of soccer and something like that. Like both. Both ways of having having their both ways of having cultural thing, cultural side of in, in white society and Indigenous society [00:04:00] where they can work both ways and teach some of the kids who don't speak English, teach them in English and in language.\n\nTalk to them in language and tell them what this is, what are you gonna do? What's this? Even though there's kids who don't understand English, but it'll be better for them to learn alongside because they're growing up in this town where it's called War Town. We need people to understand what we're doing and what we're talking about.\n\nI need to find a funding. I wanna find a funding and then get an architect to come out and do this thing. Have to show me how I want it and how the thing's gonna be. Like I'm having a little park out here, a little oval.\n\nLike it's 'cause something where they can kick around, do something for their PE or something, during the day. Whatever school gives them to do, they can do it here. I [00:05:00] wanna see it's exciting to see it.\n\nIt'll be good. It is good a bit seeing it, it's coming from s from Nick and without Nick, I've musing the milk crates, doing it like that.\n\nYeah. But I wanna see what he does. Yeah. Let's see let's do it. We'll come back. Ready? Nick, so this can fall like this. Oh. And like this.\n\nYou just saw the finished bed. What do you think now after it's all done? Billy Belly means good. You think you'll be able to use these ones and you want some more? Yeah. It'll be good after. After it's finished. It'll be good. And it'll be using, it'll be used by me mostly if I'm gonna be using it.\n\nIf you're not taking it back, you're taking them back. Oh, thank you right now he's in my language, ma, [00:06:00] I'm a manga. \n\nThat works really good. Because why? I am saying that it takes my memories back to when I was young.\n\nDianne: Working both ways. I grew up in a language I never spoke English in, in, in the kindergarten school when me and my older sister started off going to school in that kindergarten school, they used to come and talk in language before we spoke English and tell us what to say. And it was good because getting out of language.\n\nOtherwise language would've been my li lifetime speaking without learning English. Going to school, it was good. And then I, and again, to go going up to boarding school where I met her we were in boarding school together and boarding school, going away from home, [00:07:00] four years going to school, but coming back for holidays, it wasn't, not enough. Not enough time for us to be with families just for a couple of weeks or two weeks or three weeks holiday, or four weeks holiday and then go back again. It was in that time it was a very hard time for us, but going back, still talking language to our families.\n\nGot raised in a place where we learned to speak language and then going away to speak English. It was easy. It was easy. Like we are getting out of our language, speaking English, learning more sports. Sports and doing things and meeting up with different kids from different land, different areas.\n\nComing to one school and learning different languages at school by listening to other kids who spoke language, and it was good. Hey, [00:08:00] it was good. Yeah. Because some of their language that I learned from, I've learned a little bit of, a little bit of other languages like listening to ki the other kids that were speaking language, especially the girls where we used to stay in their dormitories.\n\nIt was something different from where we've been, like, we've been in a, we got to. Just to the school where we've been in dormitory, but when we were at home, we were staying in where the eldest had a single home where they made it themself by tin shacks or by a grass humpy. We used to live in that with ladies and going up to boarding school, it was like it's different to back home, but living in a house.\n\nIn a dormitory where we had ladies, young girls, we had house mother that [00:09:00] was a lady used to be around us, \n\nif you have an idea what place you'd go to first go and talk to if they know you're coming, go to the elders.\n\nSit down and talk to them or a group of people and tell them if you can show them how to make them beds, and they'll probably be keen on joining in and helping out. Yeah. Sometimes you can go to a there's a organization where they have aboriginal people go there, have meeting with them and let 'em know, and they can take you out to show you where a good area to go to, where you can sit with some people. \n\nSomething that we need to talk to first, to the organization, talk to the community, how do they feel about doing this? And if it is, if someone comes to you, someone from the government side sit down with you and talk to you.\n\nDianne: Let 'em know what you wanna do with them. That's what my plan is to work with the [00:10:00] young youths about. Having a youth center here, something for them to do in their life. Something that they need to learn. Talk about what they do when they're young. It's not good. You're gonna have a bad record in the future.\n\nThat's what I say to my families. They need to hear from the ground, who wants it, who's gonna do it, who's out there, who needs help?\n\nThe people in the community knows about their family, the youths, what happens, what they're doing. At the moment, they're not listening. You need to step in there and tell them that they need to listen to do these things. To make their future, happy and be proud of what they've done in the past. \n\nThat's what I'm looking forward on. Someone with the money to help me out to do this stuff. Like my my, my cement slab there. [00:11:00] I'm looking forward on having something on top of it to make it like a shade or something, or have a something built on it.\n\nDianne: That's what I'm looking forward for. \n\nThere might be for the scratch. Now how, what I'm doing now, I want to show people how my placement, I can map, put a picture of where my photos were taken before.\n\nTo have a little museum for people to come and have a look at it, what it's like, and from the past to now. \n\nI've got some people who were here at the beginning taking photos of the space and I could get them and get them to give me all those photos.\n\nTo put it up somewhere where it's a museum, people can see Yep. That where it was like this, and then that's this. That's awesome.\n\nIt's turned very lovely now. The [00:12:00] weather. The heat? Yeah. It's beginning. A winter soon. It's gonna be winter, the rain. I came into Alice yesterday on the plane and it was very, it felt very strange to be cold and rain and to see water. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI want to get rid of this stuff, get this out of this area here. It's not mine. Okay. Yep. I want to get this one. Try and get someone to renovate it for me, but I wanna have it on this side here and the shelter in the middle.\n\nReally, I don't want to get rid of it. If so, it's something that how we used to live in before Little Living Museum. Yeah, this is when the magic happens. Hey, look at my magic bed.\n\nAh, long way did it doubling up. [00:13:00] Is that looking better? It looks better. I see it together. Yeah. First say it together. It just means you can't use it as storage. No, I can't. Is that okay? Yeah, that's all right. It's more strong if we zip it together.\n\nDo you think other people are gonna want their beds or, yeah, they'll probably want it. They see that I've got two more families. I've got her these, I've got my nephew and she lives over there in that caravan. I'm thinking of getting one for them too, made up for them. And two, we can, we've been, yeah, like we went to try and work at the men's shed and we might be able to work away where they can make as many as.\n\nYeah. And two more, two more for other two families. They sleep on that creek down there. Oh, that's where they have a rest. They look after my area. They've been babysitting my home. YouTube and in Barola, and I was away in town, so [00:14:00] they used to stay here.\n\nYou reckon he is done a good job or what? Yeah. Done a good job, Nic I want you to try it because we can make it more squishy.\n\nThat's comfortable. It's comfortable. Now I have to try it out. Yeah it's this number one. Oh. Why do you think so? Why do I think it's comfortable? Because. I was looking for these kinds before having a milk crate and a mattress on top. It was comfortable, but not much. But this is more And do you think you could take it to get washed when it gets dirty? Yeah. Yeah. Take it to the, I think it's the women's, oh no, my daughter's got a washing machine. Okay, so I'll do it there. Do you wanna try double [00:15:00] You try double. It's better. Some people like more firm. Yeah.\n\n"

Yep. Just your name and spell it for me first. My name is Aaron. Spell A-A-R-O-N. Sure. Last name. Stapleton. 42 years old. Been staying here at Vinny's for the last four weeks or so now. Yeah, been using yeah, laundry service, which is bloody awesome. It's great. They do an excellent job.<�/p> <�p>Big help, especially when we're in a position like we are. And just little things like washing and stuff like that, it is hard to, hard to find a place to do it and stuff like that. So the convenience is awesome. Okay. Any questions or anything like that? And what about, a bit about yourself though?<�/p> <�p>That's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.<�/p> <�p>And just getting back on my feet now, mate. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?<�/p> <�p>I guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>But when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.<�/p> <�p>Drinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.<�/p> <�p>Like I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.<�/p> <�p>Yeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.<�/p> <�p>That's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.<�/p> <�p>And what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.<�/p> <�p>But she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>And that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.<�/p> <�p>They've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?<�/p> <�p>I don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not. Literally probably 25 years jail and now serving a couple of bad sentences"

When she had a child, she had 75 percent brain damage. It took 10 years to get to walk and talk, but she tried and tried every day to get better.\n\nIt's called, the book is called, Waiting for the Sunshine, One Day at a Time.\n\nSpeaker 11: Tell me a little bit more about yourself.\n\nDavid: Ah, yeah, I don't know what to say. I was born in England and then we [00:01:00] found that we couldn't get on in England so Jeannie and I was caught in and we decided we'd come to Australia. She put in for Australia first and got permission to come before I could.\n\nSo she got on a big ocean liner and came all the way across the world on her own, just for me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nDavid: So when she was having a child, things went wrong. Obviously I must stand by her because, as I said, she came all the way across the world for me. And then, when she was sick, she had the child, she had 75 percent brain damage, which was caused.\n\nToday, they've got a name for it. It's called a clampsia today. In those earlier days, we didn't know what to call it. But they nursed her and looked [00:02:00] after her at the Hamilton Hospital, which saved her life. It was impossible to believe. How many people came to help me?\n\nSpeaker 11: What's it like having people to help?\n\nWhat does that feel like? Oh,\n\nDavid: it's phenomenal. In those days, you just couldn't believe the kind of help and people that came. It was tremendous. One lady had five children, two adopted children, and offered to take care of Jean's baby for 14 months. I said, because Jean was that ill, she couldn't look after the child at all.\n\nYeah. And so many people helped me along the way, it was unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 11: Have you ever used the Orange Sky for washing?\n\nDavid: Yes, I have. What do you\n\nSpeaker 11: think of Orange Sky?\n\nDavid: Oh, I think it's a terrific idea. Especially nowadays that things are getting tough. And you need somewhere to bring it to. If [00:03:00] you're sleeping in your car, or anywhere, sleeping about, you need to be able to bring everything down to get washed and cleaned.\n\nAnd these meals that's out and about is tremendous. We really couldn't do without them. What's it\n\nSpeaker 11: Having people to talk to and having a community? What's it like having people to talk to and a community? Yeah,\n\nDavid: Of course, we come round these places. To meet people and talk with them and keep you associated with what's going on and around you.\n\nMakes a big difference, yeah. Oh yeah, you'd be terribly lonely and stuck if you were just at home on your own and not able to get out and see these people. Yeah, absolutely. But it's surprising how many of them you meet in so many different places, all the same situation. Oh yeah, it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 11: Do you get to talk to lots of different people here?\n\nDo they have lots of different stories [00:04:00] and experiences? Oh yes,\n\nDavid: everybody that comes to these. Food, places, or meals. Of course they have different stories and have worked different ways in life. I said, and then found myself completely stuck because I said it's changed now. If you haven't got it, you will never be able to get it at the moment in Australia.\n\nIt's just got beyond the working man to be able to afford to live.\n\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And,\n\nWhat's what are some things next for you? I've got some, tell me more about the book and like what you're doing with it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, with the book it encourages people that Say they've lost their job, they've got two or three children, the bank's knocking on the door for the house, and they're going to lose their house or their car.\n\nThe book encourages them to show what you can get through as long as you've got your partner and stay together. There's nothing like having reasonable good health, [00:05:00] your partner and your family. Nothing else matters. The house and the car doesn't even matter at all. What difference does it make? You lose the house but as long as you've got your family and your partner then you've got everything.\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm really interested in stories. What do you, and you've obviously written a book. Why do you think stories are important and why do you think books are important? I\n\nDavid: think the story is so important in the book because it encourages people to stay together and to be able to get through tough times.\n\nAs I said, Jeannie was so ill, it took 10 years to get her to walk and talk. It took 30 years for, to try and run a home. I said, but that's the why the story is really going very well. It, for these times when things are tough and you're struggling so much, it really helps you with the [00:06:00] family and stay together.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: If you were to tell someone why they should buy the book, this is your chance, why should people buy the book?\n\nDavid: They'll never remember or they won't have nothing left from their legacy or their entire life of struggling or the way they've gone through life. So if you can write a book about your life, how you started, how you found your partner and how you progressed and struggled through life, this is why you need to write a book.\n\nBecause you won't have a legacy to leave behind unless you've got a book of your life story.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what do you hope happens with the book? What do you hope is the outcome\n\nDavid: of it? We're hoping that it'll help a lot of people that's struggling. And there's so many people came to me and said, Oh look, you've wrote a book.\n\nfor sharing the book with me. Because she'd got three [00:07:00] children and was losing the house to the bank. And she was in tears when she thanked me for sharing the story. I said, this is what the story's about. It's to try and get people to stay together. And be together, I said, this is a, this is what it's about, it's to get you through tough times, when you think you're struggling and having bad times, you can understand how, if you stay together, you can get through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what's where are you going back to tonight? Where are you staying, and what's that like?\n\nDavid: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 11: Where are you staying\n\nDavid: at the moment? Oh, I've got my own house. So I'll be going home to my house. But of course I'm on my own now, so it makes an awful difference. Without coming round for these meals and coming to these places, oh, it's such a hard time staying and living on your own.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: It was amazing to hear your [00:08:00] story. I'm going to buy one of your books. Yes. On Amazon? Buy it on Amazon?\n\nDavid: Yes, buy it from Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Yes. Cool. You will thoroughly enjoy it, and you'll be amazed on how many people. Like the story because it gets them to stay together and none of this family violence and all that.\n\nJust please understand that you've met together in the first place because you wanted to. So no having the nonsense of family violence or anything like this. Just be there for one another. And you'll really get life better.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing. Alright, I'm gonna get your details so I can"

        "# Irene Nleallajar\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nStart. You ready? I think so. You can look at me or you can look at that. It doesn't matter. Okay. Whatever's most comfortable. So all we need, do your full name and spell your name for me. Okay. So you go your full name and spell it. Just Irene Naja n for L-E-A-L-L-A-J-A-R. And I'm a junior. My mother's a senior.\n\nTell me a little bit about Arnie started with her family. Do you wanna start there about who your family is and where you Oh, sister Alice. Yeah. She's like a cousin. She's my cousin. Yeah. She's my big sister and we've been down here like almost 13, 14, yeah. Years. So we was here with PD for a long time.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tell me what's tell me a bit about where you are from and a little bit about your broader fam, your bigger family. Oh I got my mom and dad. My dad died almost like 30, 35 years now, but [00:01:00] my dad, yeah. And my mom, my dad's, he born in bred Palm Island, so he's Dallas at so many families.\n\nAnd my mum is from, she born Mount Isa. My mom was a NEMA before she got married to Anja, my father, so she she's from at West. She born Mount Isa mom and she traveled some when she was younger there. She was traveled throughout the Northern Territory. Then she met my dad and they got married here.\n\nWow. Yeah. Awesome. Tell me a bit about what, how you feel about Palm Island. What's your feeling about it? Do you like it at Palm Island? Yeah, Palm Island is a beautiful home and it's home of the Boman people, the 40 tribes when they first came here. During the time when travel were sent here to the stolen generation.[00:02:00] \n\nYep. And what's changed over that time since you've been here, and how have you felt during those changes in I see a lot of changes throughout the years 'cause I'm a 1960 baby, so Yeah. I'm 58 years old now and I grew up on Palm. My five brothers and four sisters, they are they people they born Palm Island.\n\nBut I was born in Townsville, so just like back in 60, in the sixties. So we were, some of us was born pre, on the mainland and not really, but Palm Island is a beautiful home. Even today I seen so many different things over the years that changes. So yeah, this is the next generation. Yeah, and I.\n\nI brought up in a like I grew up Palm Island. I come from a family of hunters [00:03:00] and my dad is a, he's a fisherman and a bush walker. He walked along here. My dad is the oldest out of 15 in the old family. So my dad was born Palm Island too. Amazing. Born and bred, like all his siblings, cousins. What, what do you think is special about the activities and things you can do? Arnie was talking about her lease and where she does and fishing and hanging out and stuff. What's the special activities that you like to do on the island that make you most happy? I grew up knowing that I come a family, I come from a family of hunters.\n\nAnd fishermen and when we were small, we used to always, activities was to go camping and learn off the land and how to survive. And grew up with mother, my brothers and sisters. So I. And cousins. So we actually come from a big family, but we come as family, always big family [00:04:00] and everything. So yeah, even if we feel second cousin, but we always know each other as brothers and sisters.\n\nAnd I grew up with so many of my cousins siblings and yeah. But main thing about pama, we grew up in a. At the time growing up, we had everything. We had our elders, more elders and older people that lived during the time of the 70 eighties and nineties and 2000 year 2000 right up to now that some of our old elders and our people passed on.\n\nSo it's up to us now as older ones to steer this generation or young generation. So cool. What's some of the more negative things that maybe happen on Palm Island that you're hoping will change? Be? Pardon? What's some of the more negative things that might happen on Palm Island that you're hoping changes in the future?\n\nNot really. It's about how you grew up in, [00:05:00] in the home environment and how you grew up. Your your parents are your first teachers. I can always say growing up and at this time of this generation is, don't really need to say, like any on the mainstream too through alcohol and drugs and see the different things now, what's happening today.\n\nSo we likable to spread out the words, that spread out. Get more to mental health training workers, get young people to steer the way today because they are the next generation. And what do you hope that Furies can do to help people that are IES\n\ncan help more and to voicing out our opinions of drugs and alcohol and the workers and many more on the mainstream. So I. Yeah, it's the [00:06:00] more, I think mental health workers that we need younger ones to steer away. So it's really the problems. It's not like Palm Island problem, it's throughout the world and throughout the mainstream and other communities, but we've got other community that cares and shares and cares for our young people today.\n\nAnd true, I believe that needing more help.\n\nWhat's your who are the people you hang out with most in Palm Island? Big one. Who are the people you spend most time with in Palm Island? Is it work or at home, or family or children? What, who do you spend with? Like I said, family is everything, so yeah. Family more at home, more during the, environment to be clear towards their young people today and.\n\nMore into, but a lot of young people today love their families and [00:07:00] I don't really like, yeah. To see more of young people getting involved in a lot of things. Like work training, more training for people today, young people to encourage them. That is life after. Education and more education in life totally.\n\nWhat do you hope for the next generation of young people that are coming through Farm Island? Are there things you hope that they do better or more of? Or what's, what do you think to do better? Finish school education. Even though when you finish school, there's more education after that and a lot more to young people today to be educated about alcohol and drugs and yeah.\n\nThat's cool. Is there anything we didn't get to [00:08:00] talk about that you want to make sure you talk about now? Or, no, just, that's all I just wanted to share about. More things to come for our people today and more jobs in our communities and not only that, like us, the older ones, we grew up in Christianity too, and that's important that Christianity.\n\nAnd what's that community like on Palm Oil and the Christian community? Is it. Big or small or, and do people go to church a lot? What's that like? I'll just say not I alone, but in between. But yeah, just more leadership in young people today and getting young people to be trained in areas and to start off small, but everything eventually will get big.\n\nAnd [00:09:00] there's a lot of services in the community and through mental health. Workers training. So some of us at 30 s we did our mental health training here. Now we're doing counselor training now. But yeah,\n\nlife on Palm Island is always, never get bored. There's people go camping and fishing, hunting. Like we did in our time growing up, going back 30, 40 years ago, 50 years ago. So not much. Older people now and our elders, but our love and respect go to our elders, our people, no past, present, future.\n\nAnd get young people to encourage 'em more, to [00:10:00] get up there and they can do whatever they can put their mind to. It\n\nis a beautiful home. This is a island home. Got so many memories of Palm and now that. The older one, young one's passing on. So got Sister Iris down here that, yeah, she helps a lot with us. She's one of the Elder the senior workers here, and she give us a lot of support and lot encouragement and give us wise words.\n\nSo just, and there's many works in the community. That they can encourage, all younger ones too. To be up there and get strong and\n\ncome away from alcohol and drugs today. [00:11:00] It's amazing. You did such a good job. Pardon? I can't wait to show you. Yeah.\n"

Education is important and their health and wellbeing is too.\n\nMy mom, we're waiting to move into our new home now at bottom end, and all she wants to do is go out camping just to laying on the beach and fishing. So I'm looking forward to that. We've leased some land at the other end of the island and ask someone to build these camps up and it'll be my camp, my children camp.\n\nAnd they're gonna learn the skills of living out there in the bush, living off the land. \\~~Back then we only had that one boat.

        "Patricia Frank\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRock. I'm always looking for good frames. Bit of tie, little camera and yes, it's weird, isn't it? I never seen those sort before. Ready? Yeah. I'm ready to go. I wanna sit on something though. Nothing to sit on. Tell him to come here. There. Walkie. What name? Tatu.\n\nGet a mud brick old one over there. Oh yeah.[00:01:00] \n\nIs the heaviest seat I've ever sat on.\n\nI have to say. I, um, for run this morning with Georgina and I stacked it big time ah, at my shoulder. Oh, true. I'm, I'm coming. Good. Alright. You just have to, so say your full name and then spell it out. Yeah. So I don't stuff it up. Okay. Right. Go. Patricia Frank, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A. Frank, FRAN. Kate, how do you like to introduce yourself when you meet someone or.\n\nHow do you like to introduce your identity, that sort of stuff? How do you do my identity? I say my name, my language, and where I'm from. Nan Creek, John Cargo. Awesome. Mm-hmm. [00:02:00] Tell me, um, how do you talk about yourself? What's like a little, little history lesson about you? Um, I'm a local warmonger person, work with health.\n\nAboriginal corporation. We work, I work with, um, local people who are homeless, needing help and support in the community. Yeah. What's, um, how do you explain Tenant Creek to people? If I was to explain Tenant Creek, um, tenant Creek is a small town population of three and a half. And it, um, it's in the Barkley region and, um,\n\nwe, it's, I'm from Oo Tribe, which is situated, um, [00:03:00] in Nan Creek, and my clan group is the White Cocker two, and which is 30 Ks from Tenant Creek up north. That's Philip Creek. Cool. Um, are you able to talk about the white cockatoo stuff as in your story or is that something you can't talk about or, or what can you say about that?\n\nWell, I can just say white cockatoo is my dreaming clan group and, um, it's, it's situated at Philip Creek and it's a dreaming site, which. We follow from start to finish. And there's another one that I'm connected through. The white Cocker two is the, um, the Yala. The Spinifex works. Yep. And we make bush medicine out of Yala and it's really good stuff.\n\n[00:04:00] Mm. Is there, are there some things you wish. Like mainstream Australia knew about this area? Or, um, are there some things in which you are hoping you can help inform and provide knowledge to people, um, about yourself or the community or, or culture? What are some of the things you'd hope people could learn from you?\n\nTenant Creek is a small community, um, town, town, um, which has different language groups here. And everyone knows everyone. And if there's someone new coming to town, they know who's the new person in town or where they're from. Like, it's not everybody's secret. It's everyone's, everyone knows who's in town.\n\nSo everyone knows everyone. And if new people in town, you know, we could just ask someone and say, oh, that's, that person is [00:05:00] connected to that family group. Yeah. Okay. What are some of the things you're doing at the moment that you're excited about in terms of like, are you growing something, are you trying to do something?\n\nWell, we have an aboriginal organization, which we are trying to set up will agenda annual your will agenda. We're trying to set up that one for housing and we're, um, trying to start with our house. Culturally appropriate way. We're designing it to go with the, our culture fits in with our, um, climate as well.\n\nIt's climate friendly, house housing. Cool. Um, you took us out to a, an amazing place. Um, today. It was two amazing places. Um. What can you tell us about the welcome staff? Are you able to talk about that? Which one you did this [00:06:00] morning? The welcome we did this morning at the Riverbed, um, what it, uh, we went and did when with Jimmy and yourself, we went to like a Oh yes, yes.\n\nYeah. We went to Water Hole, which is called Jungo. And um, it's a War Moore site and it was a Warrimoo site where. It held water for our people in the 19 hundreds. And Baldwin and Spencer visited that time and stayed, I think three months. They stayed and watched the war and more people celebrate their ceremony and they were showing off their ceremony and they were, um, there were a lot of photos taken.\n\nSo these old peoples that, not around now, but they sorta. Um, connected up to these non-indigenous people, and they [00:07:00] were friends. You know, I think they understood who they were. They accepted them into the war, war country. Yeah. Is there a, is there a chance that we do that again, like at the moment, and how do we do that?\n\nLike, how do we continue to have successful partnerships like that in the modern day? We do it now. Like for example, you, you know, and Nick, Sally Georgina, you know, we accepted them and accepted you Mob to come to our OO country and um, you were special to us. You know, you're here to help us, not here to.\n\nUm, use us up and all that, but you're here to help us and support us as we go along and grow our organization. Mm. That's super special. Um, what's the, what do you hope that this [00:08:00] might grow into in terms of, um, what you're doing with your organization, but also I think you've got some dreams of some, some bigger stuff as well that on station stuff.\n\nLike what do you hope that turns into? Well. We wanna get bigger, we wanna help other people, other language group, other culture from different countries, how they wanna, um, how they want to, um, design their house using their culture, their language, their, their climate. And. You know, 'cause we all got different climates, we all got different languages, different culture.\n\nSo we want that to build our relationship up with other language groups and to make them happy too, you know, how they wanna live. Yeah. Awesome. Um, there's a specific focus not to work with government at the moment. [00:09:00] Is there a. Um, I suppose, could you explain that and, and like, almost like what's the future of that, do you think?\n\nIs there a movement away from that in the future if something changes? Well, I hope this new government will start listening to us. You know what we want because we are the First Nation people. Someone need to start somewhere and we're starting somewhere where we are gonna help, not just our war, more people, not just our family.\n\nWe wanna help family throughout the NT and their First Nation People. They are too, you know, same as us. Awesome. Um, are you doing some stuff with LT as well? What's, what's that sort, what's that stuff you're doing with lt? We're hoping to set up a, um, cultural tourism and cultural awareness [00:10:00] down the track.\n\nYeah. We are hoping to do that with tourists to do cultural awareness, um, within our, within our language groups. And within our country, and to teach people who wants to know about our language and culture and our, um, living environment and our languages, what's here? Mm, that's cool. What do you need to make that happen?\n\nWhat's the, what's the sort of things that you don't have that if you had them, you would be able to go, what's that? Sorry? What, what are the things you need to make that happen? Like, what do you need? Um, well first of all, if we're gonna set our cultural awareness business, we wanna try and, um, um, try and get money to build a building, to do cultural awareness, to do cultural tos or tag along tours to show our bush [00:11:00] tucker our.\n\nBush medicine, you know, uh, I do bush medicine already and we've done cultural awareness already, so we know what direction we're going. Mm. That's awesome. Um, it's been an intense few days of like learning and growing and, and doing stuff. Um, one direct question I had was, what do you reckon about these beds?\n\nOh, the beds. Yeah, I reckon they're deadly. Why do you reckon they'll work if they, I reckon they're hard and they're stable and they're, um, strong in a way. Yeah. And, and it's very handy. We, I, I'm trying, I wanna make a couch out of it instead of a bed. Mm mm. Where, um. [00:12:00] Sometimes it's difficult for Nick and I I think because I think betting is quite a serious problem and like there's not a lot of other solutions out there.\n\nSo sometimes we think ours might be okay 'cause it's a bit better. Um, what do you think we should do to keep, because we we're trying out washing machines and, and fridges and stuff. Like you've got any advice for us as we try to grow and, and help other communities and stuff as we, we do this, I reckon washing machine.\n\nSomething easy, simple that they can use without power to, 'cause there's people out in the, um, CLOs, they're little homeless people. They live out in Tin Sheds and they, they truly wanna a washing machine to wash their blanket, to wash their clothes, and it's right there at home. Mm-hmm. [00:13:00] Yeah, it's so cool 'cause we have so many options with washing machines.\n\nYeah. We've got hand ones, we've got like battery ones. We've got other ones. So yes. Awesome. Yeah. Um, yeah. Thank you so much for hanging with us. Yeah. Thank you. There anything else that you wanted to say on, on camera that you always wanted to No. No. You wanna talk shit about someone or, yeah, I.\n"

The wind is coming through.\n\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, I can, I can steal the wind there. The\n\nSpeaker 9: rain on the plane falls mainly in Spain or the other way round.\n\nSpeaker 8: Tell us, you just have to tell us your name and spell it again. Sorry. Beautiful. You can talk to me, you don't have to talk to that.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSpeaker 9: Drew Nichols, DRW Nichols. I am the, uh, operations manager at Foothills Community Care.\n\nSpeaker 8: Cool. Rus, tell me a tiny bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I'm the operations manager, so I, no, so I, I live in the hills. Uh, I've lived in and around the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It's a beautiful part of the world to be, um, I've got a real heart for, for community and for people finding their place.\n\nAnd so particularly the community meal night, there's nothing better than someone finding their place at the table with cutlery on one side and salt and pepper and flowers. It's a really beautiful thing. Uh, it's that great equalizer. Once you sit around the table, you find community, uh, and everyone's the same.\n\nSpeaker 8: That's [00:01:00] amazing. What's this soaring sky community thing? What, like how does that match together and does it match together? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 9: so part of that table, it's all that dignity. And so a big, a big thing of what we want to do is dignity. Uh, and so something like orange sky, uh, is a, is a, is a great service for some of our folks who, uh.\n\nThat is not a, a lived experience for them. They're not able to access clean clothes, and when you don't have clean clothes, you don't feel very good. You get really stinky. Uh, we've got some people who, um, uh, need to be applying for jobs as well. So when you don't have good clothes, you feel stinky, you feel pretty rubbish about yourself.\n\nSo Orange Sky's a great service and it means that people can access, uh, fresh, clean clothes and it just, you know, it has amazing boost to their mental health and general wellbeing.\n\nSpeaker 8: Something about this place, philosophy, values, safety. What it's, what, what do you think that provides A safe place where people feel like that's, they want to all do that.\n\nYep. You know what I mean? I don't see any behavior that is like, um, sort of [00:02:00] going outta the, the mold or causing any trouble. Yep. Where does that come from and how does that get built?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I think a big thing for us is, you know, we, we, this mill here is in the Furniture Gallery village and the village is, it's off Berwood Highway.\n\nNot many people go through it. It, it kind of comes from a real sense for me around the local community and care for community. You know, when you know your neighbor, when you know their friend, you take care of them. And so I think a similar thing is translated here. We're in a smaller community, but people really care for one another.\n\nAnd when you get to see the lived experiences, you hear the stories for, for some of our folks, they hear similar stories from one another. And I think when you combine stories, people together and food, there's this beautiful fermentation of, of community care and it can be people at their best,\n\nSpeaker 8: so Right.\n\nUm, this whole idea of conversation, so the lens itself more to me, that term [00:03:00] story, how does stories. Continue to build what you have here and what, what do you think should happen with those stories over time? Yeah. Like, and how does that continue to support the longevity and the future of this place?\n\nSpeaker 9: So stories are really powerful.\n\nStories are a reminder of past, they're a reminder of emotion and feeling and experience. But quite often that those experiences are the foundation for what the future looks like. So I think about people that live in boarding houses. Hearing their perspective and ongoingly hearing their perspective is a really important thing because it's a reminder of how people in the community live who are much worse off than me.\n\nAnd whether it's boarding houses or people that sleep in tents in the forests, or people who are sleeping in cars, we, they have lots of those people. Uh, we can't forget those stories. We need to keep hearing those stories, uh, because they remind us and, and really encourage us of the importance of this sort of thing.\n\nUh, because there's lots of [00:04:00] complex reasons why people don't have secure housing. Uh, but bigger than that, what we can do is we can provide a place of safety and that one piece of safety, that one bit of, uh, listening to story, uh, can have ripple effects that go well and truly beyond just one community meal night.\n\nThey allow us to, uh, think bigger ongoing, what we can do to make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 8: Um, those stories, how do. Ripple out to people that at the moment don't really care or don't have access to knowing what's actually happening. For people that are struggling, is there a chance to, I dunno if it's changing people's minds or even just touching a few more people.\n\nMm. Is there a better way to do that? Like, do you have to force feed naturally? What's the way in which you do that in a way that's like you have here, right? Like a natural. Experience organic.\n\nSpeaker 9: I think it's a bit of everything. I think, you know, our world is so fast paced now. Social media is, is running at [00:05:00] lightning pace.\n\nI think it's a few different things. I, I think it's, it, it is certainly around messaging in a really tight, short space, getting the powerful message out there, whether that's social media or whether that's in some other form. I think it's that. But I, I, I think more than that, I, I, I, I think it's, it's the long.\n\nA difficult discipline driver, just continuing to say the same thing again and again and again. Uh, and that's can be challenging and you get a bit frustrated. Uh, but I think, you know, it's, it's seems like connecting with your local ministers. It's, you know, it's politicians, it's department heads, it's other agencies that we work with who should have a footprint here.\n\nThey say they do, but they don't. Uh, so it's, it's, it's the long hard stuff where you just have to keep, uh, advocating for people. Hmm. Uh, at a corporate level, at a government level, at a support level. Uh, because if you don't do that, the, the story just gets lost and life just moves on.\n\nSpeaker 8: And last question.\n\nYou're doing such a good job. Um, I do a lot with [00:06:00] young people, especially young people that have, um, too much contact with this system of youth justice and those areas is, do you see young people here? And then also what do.\n\nWhat's, what's that opportunity to capture those kids that maybe like, it's not cool to come here? Or like, what's that maybe here?\n\nSpeaker 9: So, yeah. Yeah. Great question. So I think going back to the ideas of community, I think I've been a young person, uh, I know what it's like not to fit in. Uh, and so I think, you know, particular I'm thinking about young men particularly.\n\nYou need mob, you need people that, that where you have a sense of identity and a sense of security that comes from that. That's missing in a lot of young men, particularly girls as well. That sense of a, your story within a bigger story, that stuff is missing. So I think something like a meal night here, we can't do all of that.\n\nBut if you can get a young person engaged [00:07:00] developmentally with older people, with people who might be different from you, but have an interest in you and show an interest in you, that over time can begin to make a difference. So I think there's lots of things that we can be doing better to engage the younger people.\n\nUm, but I'd be really, really keen to see what else we can do because I fully appreciate people need purpose. People need a place to call home. People need a place where they see themselves within a bigger story and places where that doesn't happen, that can lead down a really difficult path.\n\nSpeaker 8: Geez, jeez, dude."

        "# Julie Jaunty\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nOkay. Alright, so just your full name and spell it. Sorry, one more time. Yeah. Julie Jaunty. J-U-L-I-E, jaunty, J-A-U-N-C-E-Y. Tell us a tiny little about yourself first. I'm in my mid fifties. I used to do nursing. I gardener unexpectedly had a stroke four and a half years ago. Otherwise, I wouldn't be coming here today 'cause I've lost function in one hand.\n\nAnd even though I've got a washing machine, having this services invaluable because I can't take online or go up and down steps. So unlikely people are using this service. I really appreciate it. That's cool. Casper, what are you doing? What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\n\nEverything was blamed on Covid. I had literally my straight, literally when Covid happened, all the hospitals got closed down and services. So it's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to [00:01:00] work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. Tell us tell us a bit about the, how you feel being at shift is what, like what sort of shift? Six shift. Oh. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\n\nI am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to [00:02:00] be unusually nice. I was, a bit hesitant. I'm thinking, oh, what sort of people gonna be here? But there's a lovely experience. You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\n\nI'm, I have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand. That's cool. And what's the, what do you think the main takeaway for you is in terms of what orange Sky does as a whole?\n\nIs it, do you think it's more about the washing, the people connecting the services? I actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. [00:03:00] So That's wonderful. That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\n\nYeah. How do you represent yourself? I guess in that big picture of things, I find myself unusually disadvantaged. I wouldn't have thought I'd be disadvantaged five years ago, but I had a straight four and a half years ago and you cannot access services and so that just made it very difficult. I know I can speak okay, but I walk quite weird and hand functions and what it used to be, so unlikely people.\n\nReally need this service or can access services, but everybody says, oh, wait to go on NOS or wait to. Those things take years and you've gotta get your washing done every week or two weeks. So it's really good to have that service in between. True. And what do you think about life as a whole in terms of the community?\n\nDo you see a lot of struggle or, yeah. I live from Elizabeth, which is like a disadvantaged suburbs supposedly, and I [00:04:00] do see a lot of like homelessness in parks and people going to food vans and all that sort of thing. But I'm. I've only got my advice point of view, but I just think there are a lot of, if people are hungry, especially you can always get food.\n\nBut getting washing done or home, like I know people that are living in cars or doing the couch surfing thing. I. I've got a friend who has only moved to the country. Two years ago she, her and her mom were in long term rental, 19 years. So they presumed it was like their house. They were given three months notice to move by the landlord and they just couldn't afford a place.\n\nSo they bought a dumpy house, middle of nowhere to to stay for roof over their heads. So unexpected people can be homeless. So true. What's it's always interesting to get your take on what this shift is like. So could you walk through how that, how it happened in terms of like A, how did you know about it and then B, what does it feel like?\n\nWhat's it like to be Okay. I heard about like paddle jumpers can paddle [00:05:00] jumpers, and then they, other people told me about the orange sky van, which I thought was very. Help, helpful. I didn't know about it beforehand. I don't use the internet or Facebook or all those sort of normal things 'cause of my funny hand.\n\nSo I was unaware. I'm quite sure that there's advertising, but I just wasn't aware of it. Cool. And what's it what sort of a normal shift look like for you? Normally people try to get here five o'clock for for when the sort of lineup with their washing and the van turns up when it turns up and people are quite happy then people.\n\nYeah, it just seems to be the routine. You get your spot, van turns up, gets something to eat, and then you come back and have a chat around the back of the van. It's mainly being a lady, so it's nice. That's cool. That's awesome. Is there anything that you've always wanted to talk about around Orange Sky yourself that we didn't talk about?\n\nI would like to know how you can advertise it to other people who wouldn't. Like I didn't know about the service point. Who wouldn't normally? [00:06:00] No. 'cause I wouldn't have, I've got a house I wouldn't have considered myself homeless. I wouldn't have known that I needed hands with washing or mainly hanging out.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know how you can actually inform other people. It's a great service. I've been told they go to different places on different days, but I don't quite know if everybody who needs a service knows about it. Seems to be a few regulars turn up, but not other people. Awesome. Such good feedback.\n\nNo worries. I'll I'll have to, yeah. I think the idea with this stuff is like your insight Yeah. And your knowledge Yeah. Is way more than anyone could ever Yeah. From Bruce Head office. Yeah. It's super helpful. Okay, great. Good to help. Thank you. I'm just gonna take.\n"

You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nI have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand.\n\nI actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. So That's wonderful. \\~~That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\\~~\n\n\\~~Yeah. How do you represent yourself?\\~~\n\n",

        "  \"text\": \" Action. Kel? Happy about that? Look at Nico there, Richard. Oh, okay. See? So you don't look in the camera, you look off camera. That's the better side. Well, now you say it like that. Funny. Initially, I actually went, oh, gosh, that's an attachment to the cannon. Then I went, oh, no, how the hell is that? Two times the cannon. I don't know how to say it. Two times the action. Mmm. Maybe let's start with the easy stuff, Rich. Where are we right now? Where are we right now? Yeah. So we're at the top of Mount Bentley. More specifically, this is where we we are endeavoring to have a plant propagation so i suppose and this is the uh second field i call it yeah what country are we yeah so mount bentley so is uh um yeah this is myumburra Country. Yeah, so a little ways over to my shoulder to my right is a little waterhole there that's the Gabba Dreaming. So we're not far from one of the story places, one of the key story places for our mob, the Carpetake Dreaming. What's your connection to culture? What's your cultural connections to? Yeah, this place. Yeah, so this is my grandmother's country. And she's a mum of a woman We married a Nahuatl man. So Nahuatl country is 30k, you know, in that area where we called Ingham and down to Rolling Stone, that's the Great Divide. That's Nahuatl country. But grandfather would say to me, you know, Richie, you're always gonna look after your grandmother's country. So a very long road to coming back and to this place and just the honor of carrying out my cultural obligation to that story, looking after grandmother's country. What does country mean to you? Um, oh gosh, here we go. Yeah, connection. Um, yeah, provides connection, belonging. Yeah, it's a space that keeps me grounded. But also grounded because our story, our mambla story is written in this country here. So different places, different story places. It grounds me and it keeps me centered. And in a sense, gives me a purpose and joy. Yeah, yeah. We're going to dive into a few different, um, uh, sort of cultural stories that are profound in your wisdom and sharing. But before we do that, like what's, what's story mean to you and what's the significance of story in your life? Hmm. Yeah. Um, yeah. So I think it's, it's come out of or in response to, um, navigating, um, what I call the doing culture in Australia which is what do you do when you grow up I'm going to be something and this is what I'll do and so yeah so that sense of yeah it's a long way of saying, you know, that I went and got an education, I got a trade, I got a degree and there were things that I did. But that didn't translate into my belonging or my sense of who I am. Yeah. So what was the question? Who are you then? Yeah. So, so in a sense, um, country helps me be, and helps me be me, um, and helps me understand who I am. And it's out of that that from that base of where I land and say okay that I can work out what my doing is going to be you know if that makes any sense talk me through this idea of our story our story so yeah our story story comes out of the narrative of, there was a time when I had two stories. I had a doing story and a being story. The doing story is what I did to earn a cut of living, to be able to provide for family, to, and do those things that every Australian, in terms of the Australian narrative, the quarter acre block, yeah, I could do that and did it a couple of times and then went hmm. So that was one story. and then went hmm so that was one story um um the other story of who i am and uh which you i didn't fully understand or know that when granddad said you're going to look after your grandmother's country I did not know the fullness of what that meant, if that makes any sense. And so that's been a journey. It's been a journey to sit with elders, to find the place of their belonging, to find those stories and in a sense I couldn't work out what I needed to do in that space until I could be in that space. And so that meant that I had to be on country and have time with my old people and time around the fire and time around understanding stories um and time to be quiet um to learn um yeah how do we as a well i guess um talk me through this um the story you shared very generously around like tell me your, I'll tell you my story, and let's create our story. Talk me through that and where does that come from? Yeah, so I couldn't, you can't do something or give advice to someone about those sorts of things unless you walk the walk, if that makes any sense. Those sorts of things unless you walk the walk that makes any sense So in a sense I had to join those two stories together and then work out What my story was going to be? Interesting so So in really I Navigate those two worlds Intuitively inside almost all day every day. So I've got this dominant culture side and I've got this, yeah. But then, and this cultural side. And one informs each other. What the amazing thing is, though, is that I can take that model and translate and almost use it as a vehicle to engage not only first people to engage because I say to my cousin brothers or who I'm talking to or my colleagues or my the workers under me, we've got to navigate these two wells but for you to understand these two wells you've got to navigate these two worlds. But for you to understand these two worlds, you've got to know your own world. So it is about knowing your story first. That's the first thing. The second thing then is that when we engage in that space with the two worlds and with the other world, with the other understanding, with the other world, with the other understanding. There are people who are wanting to come into this space and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folk, well, tell me your story and I'll tell you my story and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become an our story. The principle doesn't change, it's the practice if that makes any sense and so that's the interesting space. It's a very, I think, it's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings, rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use, if that makes any sense. Story is a good vehicle to be able to work on, because everyone understands that story, yeah, that concept of story. Talk me through the story of the sphere, and the two sides of the the spear and what that means to you? Yeah. So that story was gifted to me by a brother from Bundjalung country, Cole Slatt, the story of two brothers and how those brothers had a certain cultural obligation to work on and in order for them to be able to execute on that they had to be in relationship with one another. They not only had to be in relationship with one another and understand how to, I guess, make that spear, how to find that spear, how to straighten that spear, but they also knew and understand that they also needed others to be able to get into that space and produce that spear. And so that concept of the knowledge holder and the one that yearns or thirsts that knowledge was a respectful transaction. Yeah, and so it was out of that that I was able to then look at my relationship with my brother, my grandfather's relationship with his brother and the sense that we all had gifts, we all had strengths, we all had, I wouldn't say weaknesses, but things that we were reliant on the other to bring into the space. yeah we're dependent on one another so that was really interesting to to to then have that story gifted to myself and then able to then say oh actually we know that story that story is actually embedded in the space. So we also learned that in that space, you know, it's almost like pulling a string. Once you start that thread about that story, you go, oh yeah, well, yeah, and by the way, no one holds that old story. And it just keeps going on and you go, oh, okay. So, yeah, part of the spear is that we learn now, to put it in today's context, how you talk about the one brother who's, or the one story that comes from First Peoples, and we talk about L-I-Y-R-E. I talked to my alpha and I said, we've got to navigate this new story that's come into the asbestos because the environment's changed. So we call it the L-I-W story. And so when we make this spear, this one that enables us to cut a path into this landscape, we actually need two sides of the story, the L-O-R-E and the L-A-W. And yeah, and so in that sense, we're sensitive to brothers and sisters who come to this place, who've got a heart to stand in respectful conversation with us, who say, tell me your story. And this is our story. And we go, oh. And then we say, how can my story and your story become in our story the other part of that two registered spear despair is that there is this the spear has two edges but there's there's a body in that spearhead um and so part of the the body of that spirit is the conversations, the respectful conversations that we have, whether it's through individuals, whether it's through councils, whether it's through CEOs and those are the conversations that happen. The mechanism that we have within that spirit is held in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we say, well, what's in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we we say well what's in the shaft well the shaft is all of our policies and procedures and how we and and our hr documents and how we i guess um give backbone to that spirit and if you don't have those elements And if you don't have those elements, what you've got is two edges and you haven't got any drive sort of thing, you know. Yeah, and then I think even if you talk about the length of that spear and how it powers, part of what drives that spear to be able to have an impact in community is, you know, the vision that an organisation or a person that has. It might be in, you know, the strategic plan, whatever that is, but it's trying to make sense of, for my people, how can we use a cultural artifact to understand what we're going to do? And yeah, and when we say, oh, yeah, this is going to drive and power up our spirit, then we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. So it's a helpful way to understand that construct because then what happens is that as we then build organisations, we've got a young organisation, Mumba Operations, we then can figure out, because we use spears to hunt fish, and we go, oh, well, now we're oh, well, now we're hunting for particular fish. So we want the Goggin who understands how to do finance, the Goggin who understands business, and the one who helps us shape policies and procedures and whatever. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. Talk me through the Barnum and what have you. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. So talk me through the Bhanam and the Gogan. So that's probably the key story that holds how we operate, if that makes any sense. So, yeah, that you have a knowledge holder and then you also have the one that you... So, yeah, you can't really talk it through except to say, this is how it works. And then once someone grabs that understanding then did you work it out in your practice. That story is dependent though in its practice for for entities to hold each other's story in balance or gently, if that makes any sense, and respectful conversations. It's not to say, I am the one who knows and you need to jump through. It's about know, it's about, about hey i've got something that i'm going to offer you and you can choose to take that story or you can choose not to take that story but then that's okay um and i know that um when we when we have those conversations, that space, some, because that was a conversation that my old people had, we had the ability to actually say, I'm not ready to carry that story yet. So it's really interesting. So yeah. Where does the Bāna and Gobind come from? It's an apocultural practice. Yeah, yeah. The fact that we can name it has been a gift. We've actually practiced it. But we actually, then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. So it's not as if you find gold. You actually were doing things intuitively. I remember saying to someone, well, there's a show. Who do you think I am? Yeah. Yeah. And people would follow their DNA and then they'd discover, oh gosh, this is why I'm wired the way I do or why I might like woodwork or why I might love fishing. It's because I've actually had things running through my veins that I didn't understand, if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. understand if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. Is there a moment where it comes to mind where you had that Barnum and Goggin present in your life, like when you were seeking knowledge and it came, or you were gifting knowledge? Oh, again, it's out of practice. My grandfather, he was the governor who taught me here. 80% of what I know in terms of how to navigate country and from the age of, oh, eight or nine, you know. Yeah. Yeah, but I was sent to my grandfather by my father, who taught me some things to a certain point. So you learn in stages, so my grandfather took the lead role to give me the old knowledge, And then he then handed me to my uncles who honed that knowledge into a sharper, more focused thing of where to go for certain fish. So it took all of those knowledge holders to get me to shape who I was, who I am. However, and this is the however that I find, is that the Barnum Goggin story was really important because it was an old story that crystallised that practice. You know, I just thought this is why he just did it, if that makes any sense. There was enough. Yeah, but then what we learned now is that that was their cultural practice. And it's an old story that runs right across this landscape. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Do you want to talk about the pebble? Do I? Yeah. Yeah. We should do this. You know, I was actually thinking about this and I thought, oh, okay. These sort of conversations usually are hard to do in a sit-down space because you usually do it when you're on the mire. Yeah. So, yeah. So the Pebble story is about you know minding our footprint um so when we talk about minding our footprint we as human beings um we suffer from the fact that that we have things that tell us that our footprint has been great so things like global warming and how the environment's um trading and uh some of times it's doing well and sometimes it's not doing too well the fact that we have um you know animal species becoming extinct and we think about here in Australia where we introduce things like the cane toad and we go, oh. And if that's an indication of a pebble, you go, oh, that was a big pebble. So the story behind the pebble is actually how we enter someone else's country and grandfather would say, you know, yeah, we can have these things. Well, he wouldn't say because he didn't know about the things that we do in terms of welcoming the countries and all those sorts of things that we do, which is absolutely fantastic, don't get me wrong. But he had a very simple story because he actually said, boy, every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. Every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. And I did not know what they meant by that concept of country even back then. But what he says is the principle, whenever you go across and you get into a new space, first thing you do is find a little bit of water and you find yourself a pebble. You take that pebble and you might put your sweat on that pebble under your arm, but you toss that pebble into the water. And that was it. That was just the practice. And you went, oh, okay. And for years, I was just going, I just passed this paper. I didn't ask why. This was just what you did. It wasn't until a little bit later that you come across other elders and other elders would have From different story places whatever Welcome to country and in that welcome to country they would put this get a pebble and they wipe their sweat on And they would toss it in the water and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone but anyway and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone, but anyway. And I'd go, oh. What happens is in the quiet spaces when you're sitting on country, country then speaks to you about those stories and you reflect on it and you go, oh. And I remember thinking to myself one day, I went, why didn't you get a boulder? Why didn't you get a rock? Because when we were young, we'd throw a big-ass rock in the water, you know what I'm saying? Why was it a pebble? And as you stop and you reflect about that, I remember finding stones, and we would get the most smallest, flattest stone and as kids we'd show it. We'd do this practice but we'd show it to the heavens. And then we'd watch it go and it would just make the splash and go. And we'd go, that's a good start. And as you get older and wiser, you think about that and you go, oh, that's why he wanted a pebble. Because we've got to manage our footprint. And so, don't come to someone else's country as a rock or a boulder, but as a pebble, so that your footprint is small. But when you leave, that person says, oh, that one came, your presence is great, and there's a heart. Yeah, he came and didn't make a ripple. So he's welcome anytime. What's your dream for this site same same we look at this the boulder of this pine trees which is not our car shouldn't be in our country um why they're here well they're here because someone thought it was a bright idea to take all the old growth out of here and use that old growth timber for the mission and then replace it with the pine trees. So, yeah, we've come... We're planning to minimise that boulder and the impact of that rock and restore this country. And so down over here where you see all of these, the seedlings from the rainfalls, that's the last 10 years of growth in that creek lying down here. And so those pine trees that are... Oh, palm trees that are there, they're average between five to eight years old, and they're strong. So the country is restoring itself and regenerating itself and um and so we're not going to do a new thing we're going to figure out how we can harvest some of these seedlings and then restore this space um yeah it might not like look like all of that but It might not look like all of that, but some of it. What's your hope of this site too, is in 10 years time? In 10 years time, in 10 years time, this particular area, we hope that in the plant propagation space, that the younger leaders who come here, who, they can imagine something here. So the old folk have had a strategic plan back in 2010. My role is to create the foundations for that to operate. And now we're in that space of training education and we're having our young barn arm leaders learn from the dominant culture the that how to navigate the space but also how to what does it mean to work in the plant propagation area. And then how to think business-wise and what could that imagine it to be. So the goal will be that in this space, some of our young people from Palm will be inspired to imagine what this place might look like. And so, yeah, in 10 years' time, I don't know what will happen in 10 years time i don't know what happened 10 years time but i'll hopefully to court and release some of those banners to be a goggins of this place and they can work out what that might look like why is the um the willy wagtail important to you yeah um yeah everyone's got a story of redemption. The Wagtail is my story of redemption. I don't want to go into that part of it, except to say that the Wagtail in our culture is good news and when we hear we get bright chirping busy little busybody yeah so the wagtail for me is has been that story of being chirpy and bringing some some good news to the space. Yeah, so he's been my totem since I was a young fella. And yeah, I do, it's really interesting cause he's got the black and white colours and I resonate with him because I find myself in the space where I'm navigating these two worlds and hopefully as I do that I'm being a noisy wagtail but bringing good news into that two world conversation. good news into that two-world conversation. We were talking about noise last night, in particular music, but what are the noises that you're prioritising listening to right now? What are the sounds that are important for you to be listening to? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. The more I am in this rainforest area, the more I see the complexity of the different species and the different power regions and what each species of tree bring to give shelter to not only a bird life but also the insects and and then you know yeah just that diversity And we call them plants, don't we? It's collective, we call them plants. And I think about that often and I go, oh wow, it's a magic place, but these plants place but these plants do something where they're intuitively cooperating and engaging with one another and you know and when the breeze comes there's a little bit of give and go, you know, the sway and yeah it's just really interesting. So the space I'm occupying in terms of this Bhanam-Garga and relationship space isn't so much the knowledge holder or the one that earns, but the good oil that runs between the two entities. Yeah. And I have a sense that if we're all plants, we're all human beings, or we're all brothers and sisters, if we're all friends or whatever collective word that we could use that doesn't bring an us and them, I think we could be a pretty good rainforest at some point. And that's probably by some happy point. How can we collectively collectively be shelter to those birds of the air that are just going, I need somewhere to roost tonight. How can we potentially at some point die to oneself and regenerate into something new. And I'm not talking physically die, I don't want to die, but my ideas or my ego, whatever it is, so that I can let go and let something else flourish. I think, yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. Yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. And what's the... What's the Rich Cassidy story that you hope people take from being in your presence? Yeah, I've often said, and this is the small pebble story, because I've often thought about this a lot, about the small pebble, because I want to be the smallest pebble I can be, the sharpest stone, the one that has the least impact. But I often reflect about when you go back to the place where that pebble went into and you look for that pebble it's gone it's very hard to find and so i'm probably thinking that yeah my footprint would be that no one knew that i was here in the first place and that'd be pretty cool and so then what do you think your purpose is? What gets you out of it? What gets me out of it? I think it's, yeah, that when I come to a place, to come to country and I go, oh, I remember that story. I remember some friends who, you know, on the Facebook thing, they would send a shout out and they would very recently say, oh Rich, so right, Cal. Just thinking of you. And I go, ah yeah, that's good. See that's, yeah, that's the impact that you want. That's it. Any other questions? Oh my God. I don't know if that's really useful or not. I'm trying to think about this artefact of, like, you as being a knowledge holder to share with, like, organisations. Sort of picturing the artefact of, like, a bit about you, a few of these stories. Is there any other sort of like, maybe you're very humble. Yeah, so this is the one that I think will be useful in the mainstream setting. So you talked about the Barnarm Cogran thing. One of the biggest stories that we have in the Australian landscape is the story of mateship. I've often thought about this and I think about that story of Gallipoli in some ungodly place. Young men were sent to war and found themselves in difficult circumstances. But that narrative, that story is right across this landscape. You go to any town and you'll find an NJAC square or a monument that depicts that story. And we call that story now very, we don't call it Gallipoli, we call it might. You know, might, mightship. You know, you look at the football, they talk about mateship, yeah, cricket, and the principles of sacrifices and no one being left behind. We just all gravitate to it and go, oh, we understand it. So it's not as if I'm talking about something that's, when I talk about stories, that's something that's grandiose or colorful. It's the DNA of the human species. And I think if that's a starting point for you to go, oh, okay, I understand where the starting point, because I understand that story. the starting point because I understand that story. Then if we learn another story about, well, that's a story back in 1914, 18. I can't remember when it was. Sorry. But there's this other story that we've got and it's bloody old. I don't know how old it was, but it's a cool story too, you know what I'm saying? I know it's not quite mateship but it's, yeah. So maybe if we go, how can we get this story of mateship and learn that and have this older story that we've got and that's our story, my story. I don't know, I think there's something in that way then in the two brothers story no one's going to be left behind. Is that okay? And what do you think is the most common thing people come to you for knowledge is? Oh look I think everyone gets to a point I think if they're honest with themselves where they've gone down a rabbit hole they've went down a one-way street they've had to do a u-turn they've not only had to do a three-point turn it's been 16-point turn you know and when they've got out they went oh wow okay i got out of that you know yeah yeah um i can't remember what the question was what people come to you for advice for yeah so the part of them getting in the car and turning it around or what are you doing yeah yeah so i think one of the things that i have found invariably is the one principle that our people hold on to that even though we've whether he's whether he's where you've got the knowledge holding the one at the ends they all they all are invariably the same the answer is in country and you just got to look around and and find that yeah and so the most of the times the answers are thin. And more often than not, we just get tangled in our own space and we bring all of these obstacles and we go, oh, damn. So part of, I think, the role is, for me in this space, is as a navigator, is, yeah, is being a guide. I wouldn't say guide to, it's about navigating a space. And it's about having respectful conversations and it's, it's about, it is about understanding the story of the other in a way that you might not have that answer, but you go, ah, I can see you, see me see you. And it's about trying to see one in someone, but not, and to hold that other gently. And conversely, if that's switched the other way around, then I think you've got a powerful space for conversation. Yeah. Dad? Richard. Thanks, Fran. What a gift okay you got a vision you got a bit\",\n\n"

        "Drew Nichols - SP - Foothills\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 8: Right. Looking good. Doing mic test.\n\nSpeaker 9: 1, 2, 1, 2. Yeah, I think we're good. Hello? Hello? The wind is coming through.\n\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, I can, I can steal the wind there. The\n\nSpeaker 9: rain on the plane falls mainly in Spain or the other way round.\n\nSpeaker 8: Tell us, you just have to tell us your name and spell it again. Sorry. Beautiful. You can talk to me, you don't have to talk to that.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSpeaker 9: Drew Nichols, DRW Nichols. I am the, uh, operations manager at Foothills Community Care.\n\nSpeaker 8: Cool. Rus, tell me a tiny bit about yourself.\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I'm the operations manager, so I, no, so I, I live in the hills. Uh, I've lived in and around the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It's a beautiful part of the world to be, um, I've got a real heart for, for community and for people finding their place.\n\nAnd so particularly the community meal night, there's nothing better than someone finding their place at the table with cutlery on one side and salt and pepper and flowers. It's a really beautiful thing. Uh, it's that great equalizer. Once you sit around the table, you find community, uh, and everyone's the same.\n\nSpeaker 8: That's [00:01:00] amazing. What's this soaring sky community thing? What, like how does that match together and does it match together? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 9: so part of that table, it's all that dignity. And so a big, a big thing of what we want to do is dignity. Uh, and so something like orange sky, uh, is a, is a, is a great service for some of our folks who, uh.\n\nThat is not a, a lived experience for them. They're not able to access clean clothes, and when you don't have clean clothes, you don't feel very good. You get really stinky. Uh, we've got some people who, um, uh, need to be applying for jobs as well. So when you don't have good clothes, you feel stinky, you feel pretty rubbish about yourself.\n\nSo Orange Sky's a great service and it means that people can access, uh, fresh, clean clothes and it just, you know, it has amazing boost to their mental health and general wellbeing.\n\nSpeaker 8: Something about this place, philosophy, values, safety. What it's, what, what do you think that provides A safe place where people feel like that's, they want to all do that.\n\nYep. You know what I mean? I don't see any behavior that is like, um, sort of [00:02:00] going outta the, the mold or causing any trouble. Yep. Where does that come from and how does that get built?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I think a big thing for us is, you know, we, we, this mill here is in the Furniture Gallery village and the village is, it's off Berwood Highway.\n\nNot many people go through it. It, it kind of comes from a real sense for me around the local community and care for community. You know, when you know your neighbor, when you know their friend, you take care of them. And so I think a similar thing is translated here. We're in a smaller community, but people really care for one another.\n\nAnd when you get to see the lived experiences, you hear the stories for, for some of our folks, they hear similar stories from one another. And I think when you combine stories, people together and food, there's this beautiful fermentation of, of community care and it can be people at their best,\n\nSpeaker 8: so Right.\n\nUm, this whole idea of conversation, so the lens itself more to me, that term [00:03:00] story, how does stories. Continue to build what you have here and what, what do you think should happen with those stories over time? Yeah. Like, and how does that continue to support the longevity and the future of this place?\n\nSpeaker 9: So stories are really powerful.\n\nStories are a reminder of past, they're a reminder of emotion and feeling and experience. But quite often that those experiences are the foundation for what the future looks like. So I think about people that live in boarding houses. Hearing their perspective and ongoingly hearing their perspective is a really important thing because it's a reminder of how people in the community live who are much worse off than me.\n\nAnd whether it's boarding houses or people that sleep in tents in the forests, or people who are sleeping in cars, we, they have lots of those people. Uh, we can't forget those stories. We need to keep hearing those stories, uh, because they remind us and, and really encourage us of the importance of this sort of thing.\n\nUh, because there's lots of [00:04:00] complex reasons why people don't have secure housing. Uh, but bigger than that, what we can do is we can provide a place of safety and that one piece of safety, that one bit of, uh, listening to story, uh, can have ripple effects that go well and truly beyond just one community meal night.\n\nThey allow us to, uh, think bigger ongoing, what we can do to make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 8: Um, those stories, how do. Ripple out to people that at the moment don't really care or don't have access to knowing what's actually happening. For people that are struggling, is there a chance to, I dunno if it's changing people's minds or even just touching a few more people.\n\nMm. Is there a better way to do that? Like, do you have to force feed naturally? What's the way in which you do that in a way that's like you have here, right? Like a natural. Experience organic.\n\nSpeaker 9: I think it's a bit of everything. I think, you know, our world is so fast paced now. Social media is, is running at [00:05:00] lightning pace.\n\nI think it's a few different things. I, I think it's, it, it is certainly around messaging in a really tight, short space, getting the powerful message out there, whether that's social media or whether that's in some other form. I think it's that. But I, I, I think more than that, I, I, I, I think it's, it's the long.\n\nA difficult discipline driver, just continuing to say the same thing again and again and again. Uh, and that's can be challenging and you get a bit frustrated. Uh, but I think, you know, it's, it's seems like connecting with your local ministers. It's, you know, it's politicians, it's department heads, it's other agencies that we work with who should have a footprint here.\n\nThey say they do, but they don't. Uh, so it's, it's, it's the long hard stuff where you just have to keep, uh, advocating for people. Hmm. Uh, at a corporate level, at a government level, at a support level. Uh, because if you don't do that, the, the story just gets lost and life just moves on.\n\nSpeaker 8: And last question.\n\nYou're doing such a good job. Um, I do a lot with [00:06:00] young people, especially young people that have, um, too much contact with this system of youth justice and those areas is, do you see young people here? And then also what do.\n\nWhat's, what's that opportunity to capture those kids that maybe like, it's not cool to come here? Or like, what's that maybe here?\n\nSpeaker 9: So, yeah. Yeah. Great question. So I think going back to the ideas of community, I think I've been a young person, uh, I know what it's like not to fit in. Uh, and so I think, you know, particular I'm thinking about young men particularly.\n\nYou need mob, you need people that, that where you have a sense of identity and a sense of security that comes from that. That's missing in a lot of young men, particularly girls as well. That sense of a, your story within a bigger story, that stuff is missing. So I think something like a meal night here, we can't do all of that.\n\nBut if you can get a young person engaged [00:07:00] developmentally with older people, with people who might be different from you, but have an interest in you and show an interest in you, that over time can begin to make a difference. So I think there's lots of things that we can be doing better to engage the younger people.\n\nUm, but I'd be really, really keen to see what else we can do because I fully appreciate people need purpose. People need a place to call home. People need a place where they see themselves within a bigger story and places where that doesn't happen, that can lead down a really difficult path.\n\nSpeaker 8: Geez, jeez, dude."

One's continuous focus and one is, um, static. Okay. It's on static focus. Okay. And you look, you look in focus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker: Sweet. Let's just make sure you're right.\n\nAnyway. All right, brother, you just talk to me, don't worry about the camera. Beautiful. Um, and just tell me your full name and spell it, will you? Awesome. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: Christian Morad, C-H-R-I-S-T-A-N. And Morad is M-O-U-R-A-D. Most people call me Chris.\n\nSpeaker: Chris, tell me a little bit about yourself, Chris. How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man. Thank you so much."

Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: you're the one videoing.\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 7: Good. How\n\nSpeaker 5: are you? How am I Dar?\n\nSpeaker 6: You wanna come and have a yarn? Why not? Yeah. Want\n\nSpeaker 5: to? Yeah. Have a yaba.\n\nSpeaker 7: Why not? You wanna hear my story? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 5: we'll do. We'll do. I'm having a go next. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: I thought you were finish. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: I know darling.\n\nI know. We're just familiarizing ourselves. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: okay. We're ready to go. Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: I won't be more than two hours. I'll be right.\n\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So on on the camera, we just need your full name and to spell it so that we make sure we know the name right.\n\nSpeaker 5: Hello, my name is Shana Wentworth. S-H-A-R-N-N-A-W-E-N-T-W-O-R-T-H.\n\nSpeaker 6: Amazing. Tell us a little bit about yourself. In your story?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I came down here today, uh, Ry Gully. Um, it's, it's not so [00:01:00] much that I'm starving hungry, but, um, it's nice to get out and have a good clean cunt meal. Most of these persons I've known for a long time, and, uh, Steve, who runs the establishment, I've known him for.\n\nOh, 25 plus years and I appreciate that they've got some fruit and veggies to take home. 'cause everything helps. And over the years I've spoken to people and we've laughed, we've cried. We are giggled, we are screamed, we've yelled, we're everything. And it's just nice to come out and meet people. Um. Some of them are around my age, some are younger and that, but not everyone's fortunate to be able to drive down.\n\nSome of them are homeless, but I've never seen any major problems [00:02:00] down here. And if there is, it would be NI in the bud. Very quick. There's no alcohol and there's no smoking on the premises. And people, well, they just respect. And they're just grateful and we just, you know, laugh and just talk about things and it's great and there's always plenty to go around.\n\nSpeaker 6: Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky and what, what sort of you, what do you feel about their presence here? Or what, what do you think about Orange Sky?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I feel safe and, uh, there is a police station close by, but. Uh, to my knowledge, they've never had to come. Uh, it's very handy for people that don't live in the immediate area because the train is within walking distance.\n\nI believe there are buses that come into the area to help people, and I think it's just [00:03:00] nice.\n\nSpeaker 6: And what do you think about Orange Guy?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service?\n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly. I'm not very good on names, but you know, I just say, hi, darl, how you going?\n\nHi sweetie. Or, or whatever. And sometimes people give you a kiss and a hug. Sometimes people are upset and they need to talk to someone. I'm not saying I understand everything or that I can help everyone, but it's nice to just have a little talk. Mm mm And, and [00:04:00] some people, not for me to say, they come down and you can tell they've had the same t-shirt on for a month.\n\nMm. Not my business. Mm. There was a service that where you could actually have a shower here, lot like, um. I think there was two or three showers, a caravan type thing, and I thought that was lovely. And whilst you're having a shower, oh, free soap and towel, bit of the old shampoo. Mm. Then you could, um, you know, if you were really desperate, someone finds you clean clothing, believe me.\n\nMm. It's very kind. And then whilst your clothing and yourself are being freshened up, you can go and have a lovely meal.\n\nSpeaker 6: Why do you think these types of, um, meals and services are important in the community?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, as I said, there's people that, [00:05:00] um, they just, well, not everyone, but you see them sitting on the streets so lonely and so depressed, and nobody will talk to them because as I said, the same t-shirt for a month.\n\nAnd you don't know their situation. Not everyone is drugs and alcohol. Mm-hmm. Bear in mind, a few may have a mental health, which is made worse by being on the street. Mm-hmm. Because there's, there's not really anyone around to help. I've seen it in the city. They've just walked past and what's a couple of dollars?\n\nThey could get some cool water. A nice sandwich. Mm.\n\nSpeaker 6: And how would you describe your own sort of experience over the last little while? Like, is that, like, how would you explain to people your own situation, scenario, and story?\n\nSpeaker 5: My living [00:06:00] situation? Mm, yes. Um, I'm now divorced. Um, I am, I'm in a ministry of Housing house, home house.\n\nUm, I've been there for 26 years. Um, I'm a mother of five. They've all left home of course, and um, unfortunately they've got themselves because I pushed very hard for education and they've got themselves some very good jobs and they forget that they've come from me and mild background. Mm. And the money that they receive each week has gone to their heads and they see me as just a thing.\n\nMm. I find it, sorry, I find it very hard. Um, I see it as borderline, um, a abuse. Mm. And [00:07:00] I have my youngest son I have not seen for three and a half years. Um, he. He's on alcohol. He was living with me after his divorce and alcohol causes temper. I believe I'm allowed to say to him, behave yourself, and if you don't, you're out the door.\n\nIt escalated. The rest is private. It was a police matter.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm-hmm. What's the, um, what's the opportunity to. I suppose, yeah. You've been talking about this place and what's the opportunity to create new community and new people here? Do you know what I mean? Like is that something that you are working to do and is this something that's helpful for you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do think? Well, look over the years I, I've been coming here, as I said, several years over, over the years I've noticed, and as recently as 18 months [00:08:00] ago, a lot of. Uh, places similar to this that were offering meals. Mm. They've just run out of funding and they've closed down, et cetera. Right. And as a result,\n\nSpeaker 6: sorry, there's a nice photo.\n\nSpeaker 5: And as a result, a lot of them, uh, have heard about this place through word of mouth and they've just drifted across here and it's nothing as Steve is extremely generous. And it's nothing for a hundred plus people to turn up at two separate settings on Christmas for a meal and a little bit of happiness, laughter, a generous with the present and a nice box of food to help you through the Christmas break.\n\nAnd for miles around, this is the only place where you can get a good quality meal. And they, [00:09:00] they have soup in the wintertime as well as the meal. Mm-hmm. And you can take food away and people are grateful for that. And it's good food that you can eat. Um, a lot of people don't have cooking devices because they're, uh, maybe sleeping in the car or something like that.\n\nThey can come here, get a nice full belly, and they'll sleep well that night.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. So amazing. What, what do you think, what do you think the general community could learn from these types of communities and people helping each other? Like, do you think that this is something that is unique and like, how do, how do people, you said it before, like, I think money gets to people's heads sometimes and they forget how to help people.\n\nYes, it's true. It's true. How do we, how do we talk about these places that other people sort of, these\n\nSpeaker 5: people are on the same level as me? Just be grateful. Today, [00:10:00] there was very little on the takeaway table, as in fruit and veggies. I was offered more and I looked around, there was people behind me and I said, look, I'm taking what I can fit in my fridge and what I can eat.\n\nMm, okay. I will make way. It's the way it is. And the people in there, they're not greedy. And if they appear greedy, it's just, they've come from different backgrounds. Some of them have been in jail.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you don't talk, you just eat your meal and you guard your meal. Mm. Because that's the, the situation that they may have come from.\n\nMm. So you, you, you, you don't judge them how they eat or what they put in their pocket because no one's going to say, put it back. No one.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm. Alright. I could talk all day, but I think we need to like find some other [00:11:00] people. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm just grateful and there are occasions when Steve gets in a hairdresser free.\n\nAnd he also gets in a masseur free and people love it. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yes. Yes. And it's so good. All right, I'm gonna take a photo. Okay. Okay. Get my good side. I'll, I'll take, I'll take that mic off first.\n\nSpeaker 6: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: just in the shot.\n\nSpeaker 6: Did\n\nSpeaker 5: I say too much?\n\nSpeaker 6: You said an amazing amount. It's true. Yes.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh, I'm way too bright. One sec. It's, this is my fault. Okay.\n\nHow about one you sit up a little bit more and Oh, that's, oh, that's awesome. Okay, great. Amazing. Thank you so much. [00:12:00] Um."

Yep. Just your name and spell it for me first. My name is Aaron. Spell A-A-R-O-N. Sure. Last name. Stapleton. 42 years old. Been staying here at Vinny's for the last four weeks or so now. Yeah, been using yeah, laundry service, which is bloody awesome. It's great. They do an excellent job.<�/p> <�p>Big help, especially when we're in a position like we are. And just little things like washing and stuff like that, it is hard to, hard to find a place to do it and stuff like that. So the convenience is awesome. Okay. Any questions or anything like that? And what about, a bit about yourself though?<�/p> <�p>That's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.<�/p> <�p>And just getting back on my feet now, mate. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?<�/p> <�p>I guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>But when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.<�/p> <�p>Drinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.<�/p> <�p>Like I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.<�/p> <�p>Yeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.<�/p> <�p>That's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.<�/p> <�p>And what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.<�/p> <�p>But she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>And that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.<�/p> <�p>They've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?<�/p> <�p>I don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not. Literally probably 25 years jail and now serving a couple of bad sentences"

What do you think in terms of what it actually does to people?\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nThe bigger impact is you don't realise it, it may seem like only a small thing. If you've got a washing machine and a dryer home, you don't even have to worry about these kinds of things or where you're gonna wash your clothes or, today I was up to my I actually, I had no more clean jo on socks left.\n\nIt was basically get me washing done today and without you guys, I would've been lugging it up to the bloody laundry mat. Paying an amount of money, which is literally 20, 30 bucks that someone like me in this position, I don't have that 30 bucks. Like we don't have that. So a service like this, like I said, and until you don't have it, is you don't realise how much of a convenience having a washing machine is.\n\nLike most times you throw 'em in the basket at home and they get washed, don't they like, and they're there, but. No. So for someone to actually think about this and think about that service that needs to be provided, and it's it's godsend mate, it's bloody awesome. It's bloody awesome. \\~~And even all chatting with all the blokes.\\~~\n\n\\~~Great service. Great service. We can't say thank you enough.\\~~\n\n",

        "David Allen - Friend - Doveton\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 11: All right, so we're going to start.\n\nI didn't get it sharp before so I'm very, I want to make sure it goes sharp.\n\nDavid: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 11: So you tell me your name, your full name and spell it.\n\nDavid: My name is David Allen and Jean Allen was my wife. When she had a child, she had 75 percent brain damage. It took 10 years to get to walk and talk, but she tried and tried every day to get better.\n\nIt's called, the book is called, Waiting for the Sunshine, One Day at a Time.\n\nSpeaker 11: Tell me a little bit more about yourself.\n\nDavid: Ah, yeah, I don't know what to say. I was born in England and then we [00:01:00] found that we couldn't get on in England so Jeannie and I was caught in and we decided we'd come to Australia. She put in for Australia first and got permission to come before I could.\n\nSo she got on a big ocean liner and came all the way across the world on her own, just for me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nDavid: So when she was having a child, things went wrong. Obviously I must stand by her because, as I said, she came all the way across the world for me. And then, when she was sick, she had the child, she had 75 percent brain damage, which was caused.\n\nToday, they've got a name for it. It's called a clampsia today. In those earlier days, we didn't know what to call it. But they nursed her and looked [00:02:00] after her at the Hamilton Hospital, which saved her life. It was impossible to believe. How many people came to help me?\n\nSpeaker 11: What's it like having people to help?\n\nWhat does that feel like? Oh,\n\nDavid: it's phenomenal. In those days, you just couldn't believe the kind of help and people that came. It was tremendous. One lady had five children, two adopted children, and offered to take care of Jean's baby for 14 months. I said, because Jean was that ill, she couldn't look after the child at all.\n\nYeah. And so many people helped me along the way, it was unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 11: Have you ever used the Orange Sky for washing?\n\nDavid: Yes, I have. What do you\n\nSpeaker 11: think of Orange Sky?\n\nDavid: Oh, I think it's a terrific idea. Especially nowadays that things are getting tough. And you need somewhere to bring it to. If [00:03:00] you're sleeping in your car, or anywhere, sleeping about, you need to be able to bring everything down to get washed and cleaned.\n\nAnd these meals that's out and about is tremendous. We really couldn't do without them. What's it\n\nSpeaker 11: Having people to talk to and having a community? What's it like having people to talk to and a community? Yeah,\n\nDavid: Of course, we come round these places. To meet people and talk with them and keep you associated with what's going on and around you.\n\nMakes a big difference, yeah. Oh yeah, you'd be terribly lonely and stuck if you were just at home on your own and not able to get out and see these people. Yeah, absolutely. But it's surprising how many of them you meet in so many different places, all the same situation. Oh yeah, it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 11: Do you get to talk to lots of different people here?\n\nDo they have lots of different stories [00:04:00] and experiences? Oh yes,\n\nDavid: everybody that comes to these. Food, places, or meals. Of course they have different stories and have worked different ways in life. I said, and then found myself completely stuck because I said it's changed now. If you haven't got it, you will never be able to get it at the moment in Australia.\n\nIt's just got beyond the working man to be able to afford to live.\n\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And,\n\nWhat's what are some things next for you? I've got some, tell me more about the book and like what you're doing with it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, with the book it encourages people that Say they've lost their job, they've got two or three children, the bank's knocking on the door for the house, and they're going to lose their house or their car.\n\nThe book encourages them to show what you can get through as long as you've got your partner and stay together. There's nothing like having reasonable good health, [00:05:00] your partner and your family. Nothing else matters. The house and the car doesn't even matter at all. What difference does it make? You lose the house but as long as you've got your family and your partner then you've got everything.\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm really interested in stories. What do you, and you've obviously written a book. Why do you think stories are important and why do you think books are important? I\n\nDavid: think the story is so important in the book because it encourages people to stay together and to be able to get through tough times.\n\nAs I said, Jeannie was so ill, it took 10 years to get her to walk and talk. It took 30 years for, to try and run a home. I said, but that's the why the story is really going very well. It, for these times when things are tough and you're struggling so much, it really helps you with the [00:06:00] family and stay together.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: If you were to tell someone why they should buy the book, this is your chance, why should people buy the book?\n\nDavid: They'll never remember or they won't have nothing left from their legacy or their entire life of struggling or the way they've gone through life. So if you can write a book about your life, how you started, how you found your partner and how you progressed and struggled through life, this is why you need to write a book.\n\nBecause you won't have a legacy to leave behind unless you've got a book of your life story.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what do you hope happens with the book? What do you hope is the outcome\n\nDavid: of it? We're hoping that it'll help a lot of people that's struggling. And there's so many people came to me and said, Oh look, you've wrote a book.\n\nfor sharing the book with me. Because she'd got three [00:07:00] children and was losing the house to the bank. And she was in tears when she thanked me for sharing the story. I said, this is what the story's about. It's to try and get people to stay together. And be together, I said, this is a, this is what it's about, it's to get you through tough times, when you think you're struggling and having bad times, you can understand how, if you stay together, you can get through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what's where are you going back to tonight? Where are you staying, and what's that like?\n\nDavid: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 11: Where are you staying\n\nDavid: at the moment? Oh, I've got my own house. So I'll be going home to my house. But of course I'm on my own now, so it makes an awful difference. Without coming round for these meals and coming to these places, oh, it's such a hard time staying and living on your own.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: It was amazing to hear your [00:08:00] story. I'm going to buy one of your books. Yes. On Amazon? Buy it on Amazon?\n\nDavid: Yes, buy it from Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Yes. Cool. You will thoroughly enjoy it, and you'll be amazed on how many people. Like the story because it gets them to stay together and none of this family violence and all that.\n\nJust please understand that you've met together in the first place because you wanted to. So no having the nonsense of family violence or anything like this. Just be there for one another. And you'll really get life better.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing. Alright, I'm gonna get your details so I can"

        "Shana Wentworth - Friend - Foothills\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 5: Rot. Eagles?\n\nSpeaker 6: No, the copper. Oh no. What? Who's rot? Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: you're the one videoing.\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 7: Good. How\n\nSpeaker 5: are you? How am I Dar?\n\nSpeaker 6: You wanna come and have a yarn? Why not? Yeah. Want\n\nSpeaker 5: to? Yeah. Have a yaba.\n\nSpeaker 7: Why not? You wanna hear my story? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 5: we'll do. We'll do. I'm having a go next. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: I thought you were finish. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: I know darling.\n\nI know. We're just familiarizing ourselves. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 7: okay. We're ready to go. Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 5: I won't be more than two hours. I'll be right.\n\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So on on the camera, we just need your full name and to spell it so that we make sure we know the name right.\n\nSpeaker 5: Hello, my name is Shana Wentworth. S-H-A-R-N-N-A-W-E-N-T-W-O-R-T-H.\n\nSpeaker 6: Amazing. Tell us a little bit about yourself. In your story?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I came down here today, uh, Ry Gully. Um, it's, it's not so [00:01:00] much that I'm starving hungry, but, um, it's nice to get out and have a good clean cunt meal. Most of these persons I've known for a long time, and, uh, Steve, who runs the establishment, I've known him for.\n\nOh, 25 plus years and I appreciate that they've got some fruit and veggies to take home. 'cause everything helps. And over the years I've spoken to people and we've laughed, we've cried. We are giggled, we are screamed, we've yelled, we're everything. And it's just nice to come out and meet people. Um. Some of them are around my age, some are younger and that, but not everyone's fortunate to be able to drive down.\n\nSome of them are homeless, but I've never seen any major problems [00:02:00] down here. And if there is, it would be NI in the bud. Very quick. There's no alcohol and there's no smoking on the premises. And people, well, they just respect. And they're just grateful and we just, you know, laugh and just talk about things and it's great and there's always plenty to go around.\n\nSpeaker 6: Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky and what, what sort of you, what do you feel about their presence here? Or what, what do you think about Orange Sky?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I feel safe and, uh, there is a police station close by, but. Uh, to my knowledge, they've never had to come. Uh, it's very handy for people that don't live in the immediate area because the train is within walking distance.\n\nI believe there are buses that come into the area to help people, and I think it's just [00:03:00] nice.\n\nSpeaker 6: And what do you think about Orange Guy?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service?\n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly. I'm not very good on names, but you know, I just say, hi, darl, how you going?\n\nHi sweetie. Or, or whatever. And sometimes people give you a kiss and a hug. Sometimes people are upset and they need to talk to someone. I'm not saying I understand everything or that I can help everyone, but it's nice to just have a little talk. Mm mm And, and [00:04:00] some people, not for me to say, they come down and you can tell they've had the same t-shirt on for a month.\n\nMm. Not my business. Mm. There was a service that where you could actually have a shower here, lot like, um. I think there was two or three showers, a caravan type thing, and I thought that was lovely. And whilst you're having a shower, oh, free soap and towel, bit of the old shampoo. Mm. Then you could, um, you know, if you were really desperate, someone finds you clean clothing, believe me.\n\nMm. It's very kind. And then whilst your clothing and yourself are being freshened up, you can go and have a lovely meal.\n\nSpeaker 6: Why do you think these types of, um, meals and services are important in the community?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, as I said, there's people that, [00:05:00] um, they just, well, not everyone, but you see them sitting on the streets so lonely and so depressed, and nobody will talk to them because as I said, the same t-shirt for a month.\n\nAnd you don't know their situation. Not everyone is drugs and alcohol. Mm-hmm. Bear in mind, a few may have a mental health, which is made worse by being on the street. Mm-hmm. Because there's, there's not really anyone around to help. I've seen it in the city. They've just walked past and what's a couple of dollars?\n\nThey could get some cool water. A nice sandwich. Mm.\n\nSpeaker 6: And how would you describe your own sort of experience over the last little while? Like, is that, like, how would you explain to people your own situation, scenario, and story?\n\nSpeaker 5: My living [00:06:00] situation? Mm, yes. Um, I'm now divorced. Um, I am, I'm in a ministry of Housing house, home house.\n\nUm, I've been there for 26 years. Um, I'm a mother of five. They've all left home of course, and um, unfortunately they've got themselves because I pushed very hard for education and they've got themselves some very good jobs and they forget that they've come from me and mild background. Mm. And the money that they receive each week has gone to their heads and they see me as just a thing.\n\nMm. I find it, sorry, I find it very hard. Um, I see it as borderline, um, a abuse. Mm. And [00:07:00] I have my youngest son I have not seen for three and a half years. Um, he. He's on alcohol. He was living with me after his divorce and alcohol causes temper. I believe I'm allowed to say to him, behave yourself, and if you don't, you're out the door.\n\nIt escalated. The rest is private. It was a police matter.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm-hmm. What's the, um, what's the opportunity to. I suppose, yeah. You've been talking about this place and what's the opportunity to create new community and new people here? Do you know what I mean? Like is that something that you are working to do and is this something that's helpful for you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do think? Well, look over the years I, I've been coming here, as I said, several years over, over the years I've noticed, and as recently as 18 months [00:08:00] ago, a lot of. Uh, places similar to this that were offering meals. Mm. They've just run out of funding and they've closed down, et cetera. Right. And as a result,\n\nSpeaker 6: sorry, there's a nice photo.\n\nSpeaker 5: And as a result, a lot of them, uh, have heard about this place through word of mouth and they've just drifted across here and it's nothing as Steve is extremely generous. And it's nothing for a hundred plus people to turn up at two separate settings on Christmas for a meal and a little bit of happiness, laughter, a generous with the present and a nice box of food to help you through the Christmas break.\n\nAnd for miles around, this is the only place where you can get a good quality meal. And they, [00:09:00] they have soup in the wintertime as well as the meal. Mm-hmm. And you can take food away and people are grateful for that. And it's good food that you can eat. Um, a lot of people don't have cooking devices because they're, uh, maybe sleeping in the car or something like that.\n\nThey can come here, get a nice full belly, and they'll sleep well that night.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. So amazing. What, what do you think, what do you think the general community could learn from these types of communities and people helping each other? Like, do you think that this is something that is unique and like, how do, how do people, you said it before, like, I think money gets to people's heads sometimes and they forget how to help people.\n\nYes, it's true. It's true. How do we, how do we talk about these places that other people sort of, these\n\nSpeaker 5: people are on the same level as me? Just be grateful. Today, [00:10:00] there was very little on the takeaway table, as in fruit and veggies. I was offered more and I looked around, there was people behind me and I said, look, I'm taking what I can fit in my fridge and what I can eat.\n\nMm, okay. I will make way. It's the way it is. And the people in there, they're not greedy. And if they appear greedy, it's just, they've come from different backgrounds. Some of them have been in jail.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you don't talk, you just eat your meal and you guard your meal. Mm. Because that's the, the situation that they may have come from.\n\nMm. So you, you, you, you don't judge them how they eat or what they put in their pocket because no one's going to say, put it back. No one.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm. Alright. I could talk all day, but I think we need to like find some other [00:11:00] people. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm just grateful and there are occasions when Steve gets in a hairdresser free.\n\nAnd he also gets in a masseur free and people love it. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yes. Yes. And it's so good. All right, I'm gonna take a photo. Okay. Okay. Get my good side. I'll, I'll take, I'll take that mic off first.\n\nSpeaker 6: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: just in the shot.\n\nSpeaker 6: Did\n\nSpeaker 5: I say too much?\n\nSpeaker 6: You said an amazing amount. It's true. Yes.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh, I'm way too bright. One sec. It's, this is my fault. Okay.\n\nHow about one you sit up a little bit more and Oh, that's, oh, that's awesome. Okay, great. Amazing. Thank you so much. [00:12:00] Um."

        "Dianne Stokes - all\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nDianne: My full name is Dianne Stokes. And I'm a local, I'm a traditional owner and where I live is where it's in the boundary of my totem and I. Been here for really 24 years, but almost 24. It's 23 years. Dianne Okay. Without shelter, just living here, having the only thing was my shelter when I first moved in was my car, my little car.\n\nI felt good, but I felt scared because of rain. Wind. Heat was to go under them. Big trees down there? \n\nNothing here. When I first came here, just the grass and trees and lizards and everything else. Insects. And what does this country mean to you? It means to [00:01:00] me, it, it means to me something that really makes me happy and it's every time I go away from here, it's like it's calling me. Come back home. And I do feel that I want to, when I get home, I feel happy I'm at home. \n\nWent through this town and my father's, it carries on from father's to father. That's why I resided here because I wanted to stay here. Where it's close enough for me to be in town for shopping and that, and for work and and for the kids to go to school.\n\nBut I was living out in a community where my grandfather's country, my mom's country, I was living there. It was good because I went back to reside there. All my fam, all my family's passed away, [00:02:00] so I wanted to go back and liven up the place. With my families and still wanting to come back here. When I come back here, I know I got no one to tell me what to do.\n\nIt's my home and I've got it registered last year. So it's the place is registered. Is it I wanna have a, in the back where the corner of my, boundary. I wanna have a cultural area there, cultural center, and a youth center. That's what I'm planning to do, where I can have day, daytime kids coming to do their homework if they're not going to school.\n\nThe kids who are in trouble with the police and they have them devices on their legs sometimes that I'm not going to school. Where it's free outside for them to do their homework and do activity like making organic garden or doing painting or doing something out here, [00:03:00] making them live enough because it's outside, there's no houses around.\n\nThey've got a little place where they can do their homework during the day. What do you think kids need at the moment? It needs the house. I need a place where, like a office and a building where the kids do the activity and cultural center at the same time where I can have a building kids go in there, do cultural works, like making bush medicines and doing weaving or something like that.\n\nAnd at the same time having game of soccer and something like that. Like both. Both ways of having having their both ways of having cultural thing, cultural side of in, in white society and Indigenous society [00:04:00] where they can work both ways and teach some of the kids who don't speak English, teach them in English and in language.\n\nTalk to them in language and tell them what this is, what are you gonna do? What's this? Even though there's kids who don't understand English, but it'll be better for them to learn alongside because they're growing up in this town where it's called War Town. We need people to understand what we're doing and what we're talking about.\n\nI need to find a funding. I wanna find a funding and then get an architect to come out and do this thing. Have to show me how I want it and how the thing's gonna be. Like I'm having a little park out here, a little oval.\n\nLike it's 'cause something where they can kick around, do something for their PE or something, during the day. Whatever school gives them to do, they can do it here. I [00:05:00] wanna see it's exciting to see it.\n\nIt'll be good. It is good a bit seeing it, it's coming from s from Nick and without Nick, I've musing the milk crates, doing it like that.\n\nYeah. But I wanna see what he does. Yeah. Let's see let's do it. We'll come back. Ready? Nick, so this can fall like this. Oh. And like this.\n\nYou just saw the finished bed. What do you think now after it's all done? Billy Belly means good. You think you'll be able to use these ones and you want some more? Yeah. It'll be good after. After it's finished. It'll be good. And it'll be using, it'll be used by me mostly if I'm gonna be using it.\n\nIf you're not taking it back, you're taking them back. Oh, thank you right now he's in my language, ma, [00:06:00] I'm a manga. \n\nThat works really good. Because why? I am saying that it takes my memories back to when I was young.\n\nDianne: Working both ways. I grew up in a language I never spoke English in, in, in the kindergarten school when me and my older sister started off going to school in that kindergarten school, they used to come and talk in language before we spoke English and tell us what to say. And it was good because getting out of language.\n\nOtherwise language would've been my li lifetime speaking without learning English. Going to school, it was good. And then I, and again, to go going up to boarding school where I met her we were in boarding school together and boarding school, going away from home, [00:07:00] four years going to school, but coming back for holidays, it wasn't, not enough. Not enough time for us to be with families just for a couple of weeks or two weeks or three weeks holiday, or four weeks holiday and then go back again. It was in that time it was a very hard time for us, but going back, still talking language to our families.\n\nGot raised in a place where we learned to speak language and then going away to speak English. It was easy. It was easy. Like we are getting out of our language, speaking English, learning more sports. Sports and doing things and meeting up with different kids from different land, different areas.\n\nComing to one school and learning different languages at school by listening to other kids who spoke language, and it was good. Hey, [00:08:00] it was good. Yeah. Because some of their language that I learned from, I've learned a little bit of, a little bit of other languages like listening to ki the other kids that were speaking language, especially the girls where we used to stay in their dormitories.\n\nIt was something different from where we've been, like, we've been in a, we got to. Just to the school where we've been in dormitory, but when we were at home, we were staying in where the eldest had a single home where they made it themself by tin shacks or by a grass humpy. We used to live in that with ladies and going up to boarding school, it was like it's different to back home, but living in a house.\n\nIn a dormitory where we had ladies, young girls, we had house mother that [00:09:00] was a lady used to be around us, \n\nif you have an idea what place you'd go to first go and talk to if they know you're coming, go to the elders.\n\nSit down and talk to them or a group of people and tell them if you can show them how to make them beds, and they'll probably be keen on joining in and helping out. Yeah. Sometimes you can go to a there's a organization where they have aboriginal people go there, have meeting with them and let 'em know, and they can take you out to show you where a good area to go to, where you can sit with some people. \n\nSomething that we need to talk to first, to the organization, talk to the community, how do they feel about doing this? And if it is, if someone comes to you, someone from the government side sit down with you and talk to you.\n\nDianne: Let 'em know what you wanna do with them. That's what my plan is to work with the [00:10:00] young youths about. Having a youth center here, something for them to do in their life. Something that they need to learn. Talk about what they do when they're young. It's not good. You're gonna have a bad record in the future.\n\nThat's what I say to my families. They need to hear from the ground, who wants it, who's gonna do it, who's out there, who needs help?\n\nThe people in the community knows about their family, the youths, what happens, what they're doing. At the moment, they're not listening. You need to step in there and tell them that they need to listen to do these things. To make their future, happy and be proud of what they've done in the past. \n\nThat's what I'm looking forward on. Someone with the money to help me out to do this stuff. Like my my, my cement slab there. [00:11:00] I'm looking forward on having something on top of it to make it like a shade or something, or have a something built on it.\n\nDianne: That's what I'm looking forward for. \n\nThere might be for the scratch. Now how, what I'm doing now, I want to show people how my placement, I can map, put a picture of where my photos were taken before.\n\nTo have a little museum for people to come and have a look at it, what it's like, and from the past to now. \n\nI've got some people who were here at the beginning taking photos of the space and I could get them and get them to give me all those photos.\n\nTo put it up somewhere where it's a museum, people can see Yep. That where it was like this, and then that's this. That's awesome.\n\nIt's turned very lovely now. The [00:12:00] weather. The heat? Yeah. It's beginning. A winter soon. It's gonna be winter, the rain. I came into Alice yesterday on the plane and it was very, it felt very strange to be cold and rain and to see water. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI want to get rid of this stuff, get this out of this area here. It's not mine. Okay. Yep. I want to get this one. Try and get someone to renovate it for me, but I wanna have it on this side here and the shelter in the middle.\n\nReally, I don't want to get rid of it. If so, it's something that how we used to live in before Little Living Museum. Yeah, this is when the magic happens. Hey, look at my magic bed.\n\nAh, long way did it doubling up. [00:13:00] Is that looking better? It looks better. I see it together. Yeah. First say it together. It just means you can't use it as storage. No, I can't. Is that okay? Yeah, that's all right. It's more strong if we zip it together.\n\nDo you think other people are gonna want their beds or, yeah, they'll probably want it. They see that I've got two more families. I've got her these, I've got my nephew and she lives over there in that caravan. I'm thinking of getting one for them too, made up for them. And two, we can, we've been, yeah, like we went to try and work at the men's shed and we might be able to work away where they can make as many as.\n\nYeah. And two more, two more for other two families. They sleep on that creek down there. Oh, that's where they have a rest. They look after my area. They've been babysitting my home. YouTube and in Barola, and I was away in town, so [00:14:00] they used to stay here.\n\nYou reckon he is done a good job or what? Yeah. Done a good job, Nic I want you to try it because we can make it more squishy.\n\nThat's comfortable. It's comfortable. Now I have to try it out. Yeah it's this number one. Oh. Why do you think so? Why do I think it's comfortable? Because. I was looking for these kinds before having a milk crate and a mattress on top. It was comfortable, but not much. But this is more And do you think you could take it to get washed when it gets dirty? Yeah. Yeah. Take it to the, I think it's the women's, oh no, my daughter's got a washing machine. Okay, so I'll do it there. Do you wanna try double [00:15:00] You try double. It's better. Some people like more firm. Yeah.\n\n"

        "Briget_Perry\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nBriget Perry: B-R-I-G-I-T. Yep. P-E-R-R-Y-R-Y. Cool. And would you like me to send this to you in email or telephone number or text? I think email would be good. Okay. What's your email? It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n"

Like they're people too. ~[00:00:00] They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service [00:01:00] volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\n~When I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money?~\n\n",

        "Freddy Wai - Friend - James St\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I'm just basically been homeless , I'm a refugee from Papua Newa. Finally got my Visa last year, May 2nd, 2024. That was 16 days before my birthday, and it was a blessing year. And now I've been living in.\n\nAustralia for six months or something now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's life been like for you, I guess for the last little bit in Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh, I think Australia is the most beautiful country in the world, and I think Melbourne. Yeah, definitely is a beautiful place. Yeah, I've been in two places only that's in.\n\nDanon and Brook, the Sunshine Victoria in Melbourne. And I like it. Yeah, [00:01:00] I like both places. Yeah. But I became homeless just seven weeks ago seven months ago. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's that experience been like for you?\n\nSpeaker 12: It's been challenging and I think it's rewarding too at the same time because I learned a lot of things I lost a lot too.\n\nBut there's a challenging part is losing a lot of friends. You are losing trust in everybody, especially the government. And then you tend to wanna blame and point fingers at, others. But at the end of the day, I think everybody deserves a place to sleep, place access to, water and electricity.\n\nAnd as for me, as a refugee. [00:02:00] Who seek for asylum in here. And I came and I got, they gave me asylum. I think these rights, I have to acknowledge that I need to make myself work harder to find another accommodation for myself. So I have a, shelter and. Electricity, water and all this.\n\nYeah. Otherwise, I'm not a human being, I cannot, I have to work harder to do this. Yeah. To find a house to live in. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 13: What was life like in, in Fiji before you came?\n\nSpeaker 12: Life was very hard. I think it's harder than. It is very difficult, harder than what I've harder than what I've experienced in my life in here.\n\nBut I've seen other people in here [00:03:00] too who are homeless who I think they face it harder than even in my country. I think my country is easier. In here, it's very difficult because it's twofold. You can see the good and the bad, but that's advantage and disadvantage from me leaving my country and from me living in here.\n\nLike in my country, you don't look at the clock. You don't really be punctual in Australia it is different. It's very difficult because the homeless people and all this, they're struggling because why they have to be punctual and pay fees and all these things and all, especially when they don't have job and all this is more difficult.\n\nYeah. But in my country, the only thing is the violence is the scary part. Yeah. The violence is, yeah. [00:04:00] There's no limit. That's the thing. So it's extreme violence. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 13: what made you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Since we got my country got independence from Australia in 1975. After that, only like my parents. They're like citizens of Australia because they were born before we got independence, but they don't get recognized for that. They haven't got a, their citizenship or anything for me. Yes. I was born after 1975. I can get a, I can't get a, passport and all this fight for my rights to come here, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMy parents fight for the right to come here too, and then I fight for my right to come here. It doesn't make sense to me. It is no common sense, but it's all right. God put the law in for some reason. I don't know. We'll work it out later, but I think it's not right. It's not right because if you are born in a country while it's still Australia, [00:05:00] you are a citizen of Australia automatically.\n\nAnd I thought it was only my parents, but I find that, half of the Korean mob and the Torres Strait Islander mob and all the ma everybody, most of the aboriginals, they don't have the citizenship too. So I think we are all in the same boat. So there's nothing to, what was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 13: Why did you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh yeah. Why I came to Australia? Yeah, because I know this this. My mother country, this is my homeland. This is my mother country, so I still have right to come here. But I didn't come. All my family and everybody, they came here before maybe 1997. Even, I don't know if I were, when I was younger, I came, I don't know.\n\nI can't remember because a lot of traveling. Around the country within PNG and here too, but I can't remember most of [00:06:00] it when I was younger. I only, the only thing I can remember is from 1993 up, when I started going to school. Yeah. After that there were a lot of tribal conflicts in my village.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So my parents have been like, they're basically like vol, voluntary workers. They're born again Christians. My father was a heavy diesel equipment fitter, and my mother was a principal at one of the secondary high schools in p and g, and then she became a community office officer for the mining company in my country.\n\nYeah. And she got some more degrees on top of her teaching and all this, and she. Yeah, she's basically the breadwinner of my family.\n\nAs a result, inherited a lot of land [00:07:00] back at home because most of my family, they come and grow up here, so my sister and my brother, and my mother's sister. So because of my land titles, my life is in danger. Because I received land royalties. Yeah. So they want to kill me. I had to take myself out of my country.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm the first born in my male in my country. In my family. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the situation daily for you in Australia now? What's the main things in which you're working on or working towards, or what do you do today?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah the first thing I'm working on is basically to get to know the people.\n\nKnow the system here, the street, the bus service is very difficult because if you grow up here, you can instinctively make decisions like what to do, where to go, what number to go. It is not like that. Every day I wake up to check the number again, [00:08:00] because I'm not sure which bus I'm getting on.\n\nAnd I keep on asking the traffic officers and all this, and the people here are very helpful and very, I think Australia is Australian and the community in Melbourne especially, they're good people. They help a lot. Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 13: Are you using the Sky Service? What do you think of Orange Sky and what they're doing?\n\nSpeaker 12: I think orange sky, I've seen it where in, on TV and all this. And I think I really appreciate the work they do and yeah, I highly recommend the people who fund and support these services. Yeah. God bless you all, like you, you got a heart, heart of gold and I really appreciate your support for the sky orange. People, I'd like to be a volunteer too, to help wash the clothes for like this, but I'm not sure how it's gonna work because that's the only thing. I have. The trolley, if you can take the picture there it [00:09:00] is. Just the trolley there. Yeah.\n\nThat's my only problem because\n\nI never been in Australia, homeless in winter, but summer is all right. That's why I take a lot of clothes there in there. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 13: And what's why do you think like this idea of connection and being able to talk to people is important?\n\nThat's part of what Orange sky does. Why is, why do humans need other people and other people to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think because it's very lonely world for me. For me, I think I'm lonely. I'm lonely maybe because. I enjoy other things and all this. Maybe I'm not I don't have a partner, that's why I'm lonely or something.\n\nBut I'm straight just for information looking for a girl. I have some of my partner ex-partners back in p and g, but since I come here, I have to start a new life, but it's very difficult for me. I can't get over it. Yeah. Like starting a new life here. Yeah. Yeah, I still have [00:10:00] my family back at home.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's like some things in which you do to connect with people in Australia\n\nSpeaker 12: In Australia, basically, I just most of the time I just say hello to people, meet them on the road. But sometimes I drink drink alcohol once in a while, and when I drink, I feel more open to speak to people and yeah, I meet a lot of people here.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 13: do you meet a lot of other people that are not from Australia and do you connect in that way as well or do you make most\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I meet a lot of people not from Australia and Yeah. But I'm very curious about the, how the real Australian, like how the Australians are. The culture and all this, how they speak and all this.\n\nI try to follow, learn the accent, the lingo. But I think if they speak in the ling the slangs I don't understand. They, I seen a lot of, when they get to the, they start using [00:11:00] the slangs and all this, they know. Yeah. And it's a different level. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it, but I understand.\n\nYeah, I understand. That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the next sort of steps for you? What do you wanna do next?\n\nSpeaker 12: The next step for me is after I understand the system, I'm gonna be like, five years. Five years I won't work because that's, I promise that already, because five years, actually seven years I fight for my visa, and finally after seven years, I got it.\n\nSo seven years I will stay. I am like a, a baby, newborn baby. I'm still growing. When I become seven years old, I will understand what to do and then I will start working there.\n\nYeah. I will start working after seven years, but now I'm so mentally tormented because I've been institutionalized and I tried working.\n\nI was working with the [00:12:00] brick laying and all these things. I just walk one day. Yeah. But I couldn't I'm a process technician. Even just fixing a bicycle. I can't do it. I try to change the wheel, change that tube. I can't do it because I can't concentrate. It takes like over two to three hours just changing the tire.\n\nSo I've been mentally affected too. Yeah. I got stabbed here. Two times here. Two times here, two times here. I'm a victim of one punch coward assault. Yeah. They punched me here too. And I fell down. Actually I was on the balcony and they punched me and I fell down because I was dead drunk, so I fell down and the cement broke my jaw.\n\nI got four screws here. Four screws. Yeah. Yes. From my fractured jaw. And then I got hit by a, I got hit by a [00:13:00] car. It's like it was lady, she stopped by the traffic light. I was coming on a bike trying to go and do a inspection. House inspection. Yeah. I come and then there was green light was on. And then she stopped.\n\nAll the cars went and she stopped. And so I took off. When I took off, she took off again and she hit me again. And then she hit me. I went to the air five meters up, landed on my head, bro. Yeah, to my ligament, spine, ligament. And then what happened was the police come to question me, take me to the hospital in all.\n\nI said no, it's all right. It's not her because she was a Muslim lady. She just pick her children and she was crying too. So I feel sorry. Like I said, no she didn't do anything. And then I woke up and I went to the hospital myself. Yeah. And that's another that's the third incident I got.[00:14:00]\n\nSo I got a lot of injuries when I came to Australia too. Yeah. Yeah. What's, what other\n\nSpeaker 13: services do you use at the moment? What are the types of things in which,\n\nSpeaker 12: I use the sender link. I use the Salvation Army, I use the library for shower, and whenever I want to do a like con. Do internet, like search some things.\n\nFree wifi. I go to the library. I even use the console wifi sometimes when I don't have data. What else do I use? I use the bus services and the train services. Most of the times I don't have the, my key, but I think the officers I used to miss understand. But they're really there to help me. Yeah.\n\nI think. Yeah. Yeah. What,\n\nSpeaker 13: and what other things do you think would be helpful for you if someone was to be able to support? What are Yeah. Are most [00:15:00] important?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think I would need support to, at least get a job. I really need support to get a job and a house like I'm mentally affected.\n\nI had a mental, independent, psych mental health psych assessment by a doctor, and he found out that I was mentally impaired and he is put a no enough in claim for my compensation. And he says, admit that, but I don't want the money because I don't know how to budget because mentally affected, I can't even work.\n\nBecause I get paranoid, I don't trust anybody. I don't even trust myself. The only thing I trust is I'm praying to God every night or something to gimme some, yeah. But yeah, sometimes I go crazy. Yeah, I try to take things in my own hands, but in my heart I know what is against my religion and I try not to do it.\n\nDo [00:16:00] it a lot, get angry at someone or get violent or something like that is no good. And I'm trying to learn how to live here. Yeah. But it's overwhelming because the culture shock. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it'll be all good. Yeah. Thanks to people like you and the Orange Sky team and all this, I think we are blessed to have, people who do this work and who support us like this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Done.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. All right. We're gonna do."

        "That's a pretty good seed actually. Yeah. I reckon that's... Let's hope we don't run out of battery. What do you mean no battery? Are we shooting? Yeah, we're shooting. We talking? We could start. My first question. So we've been hanging out for a little bit. What's the best way for me to...\nI'll just do... What do I call you? Call me Uncle Alan. Uncle? Uncle Alan? Yeah, and then I'll just do welcoming in. Do welcoming in and then we can roll. Okay. Yeah, you can talk to me. You don't have to talk to the camera. All right. Good morning, everyone. My name is Alan Palm Island. We are here on...\nBungaman Barra, Great Palm Island, Daru Maru. We look around Great Palm, all the rest of the islands around us, surrounding islands. And we are here today, a little bit myself. Our skin name is Nakawaraka, skin name. And our language name, our language is Mulkaal.\nAnd we speak in our town that we speak our language, that we call it Nakarawaraka Purpanbara. You're welcome to Great Palm. But I say the Pukumanbara. Pukumanbara means Great Palm Island, Mambara. And Darumaru means the rest of the islands or surrounding islands.\nOr Palm, Great Palm. And today, I just wanted to say that the islands behind me, it's Ngaru, they call it Kirisho. Ngaru up there, North Palm, and Guggenbaden. And across here, we've got Guggenbaden is Hoffia's Island.\nAnd you got to cross over here to Amelia, which is Phantom Island. Great Palm is sitting on, as we got here on our emblem, is Mingna Mingna Ranges. And in this emblem, we have a...\nWhich we call a shield. We call Bukal. Bukal means shield. And we, we put, I put the designs on it as a tool because our boundary is, is come into form of a, of a big manta ray. Our boundary, we call it Mingana Mingana Ranges. Mingana Mingana. Our boundaries is that area of Great Palm Island. And in that area, we keep,\nAnd I'm just trying to welcome you all today. Thanks for coming. And you go ahead. Super powerful. Pleasure to be here with you. Yeah, we can go lots of ways with this, but I think the first thing is how would you like to talk about yourself as a person from here? And how would you like to introduce...\nWell, for myself, I got my totem. It's Kurenja. Kurenja means stingray. And that's where I got my totem because you can't eat my totem or you get sick. I said, no, I'll leave it as it is. Well, my highest...\nI've been traveling a lot around myself. As a small boy, my father taught me how to paint. And as I was starting off, he just showed me how to use a charcoal and did a drawing on a piece of paper. And then I started...\nPainting and I also learned from him also what he does. A lot of work of making buccal, making shields and making drums, island dance from when I was small and I just used to watch dad always paint and I just got to learn a lot about it and very interesting for me and me and my brother Reg, my elder brother. Reg and Walter, my elder brother. And whenever they go, I follow behind.\nAnd they'd say, no, you can't come. You've got to go back. Get back. Yeah, well, they said, all right. And they'd come back. But I always go, and I learn things from my dad. But sometimes we grow, too. And eventually, we went on a different route now and started growing up.\nWe went to schools, and Dad always been busy, so we had to learn English and maths and that. Sometimes Dad always send us to do some paintings with some elders, people. But we learned what Dad taught me too, how to paint too, and painting the shields and all that too.\nAnd for myself. Been travelling a lot when I left there from Palm and as I went to school, high schools and I did some, spread my wing out and go and travel around, looking around and checking out universities and TAFEs with arts, art colleges and all that.\nI learned a lot from that. And from that, then I sort of think that I would rather come back home now and start doing better work for Mambara now. And today now, we started our Mingna Mingna rangers up and develop. And this is how we today now.\nThanks for that for all of us. We got the Bulkerman people also with us too. And they will work with us. Thank you. Amazing. I need to say this. I got to put in a platform. But is it still running? Yeah. We cut it. Yeah. I'd love to hear a little bit about what it was like being...\nBeing young and did you have a concept of what like this place was or culture was when you were young or were you just learning? What was that experience like? Well, my experience was, like I said, to go back when I was young and that was my, that was sort of planted on me, my dad and then I grew with it, see, but...\nThat's where I grew older and we had to go to learn the basic things like the stories, dream time stories. Because me, our uncle, Rich, my dad brother, he had all the story, all the dream time stories and tell about the gobble dreaming and the sister rocks and all that.\nAnd then we had to go into, he sent us down to Uncle Bill, Uncle Bill Congo. And we went down there and he taught us how to paint in his way, see? And we learned by his way. And that's how eventually the story has started to develop as a concept of children's storybook.\nFor the people. And also we had Bill Blackley, who was also a teacher at Palm Island State School. We called it State School before, but today they call it Bullgerman School. And he used to be my teacher too, also Bill. And he also brought all the stories together and...\nAnd develop it and recreate it into a story which was created by my dad. I call it dad because it's my uncle and my father. And then that's how it all started out and sort of kept me going. And by the time when I left then I went to college, did some artworks up there.\nSort of grew on me and started using different style of artworks like using screen printing, batiks and also lino printing.\nAnd we do some bit of works on campus and then we do a lot of traveling and selling them. I was at the Cairns College of TAFE back in, I think it was 1980s, 82, 83, 1983. And then from there, it was there, then I went up to Northern Territory then and to Kasserina University and did my diploma of fine arts.\nAnd from there, I would stay there for five years. When I got my graduate diploma of fine arts, they asked for a student to go down to Melbourne, the RMIT. I went down for a student residency and worked with the students in RMIT.\nTeach them our culture through there. And what I learned from there, printing, lino prints and all that, etchings. And I stayed there until three, four, five years now. Another five years. And then as I'd done all that, I was pretty good at that and came back to Palm. I was a bit homesick, I think.\nThe weather was down, it was cold. And when I left Darwin, Northern Territory, it was hot. And then I went down to the cold area. Sort of different sort of way. And when I look at it, you know, new life.\nWhat did it feel like? Did you feel like you were always representing your culture and your place in all of those places when you were doing your art?\nLike how did you learn technique that then matched with your cultural?\nWell, yeah. Well, basically with different, with a technique like a lino print, it's just so you're not using a knife, using a brush, you're also using a pen, using a knife. Then you have to cut the material and to carve out the image that you want to put on the lino print.\nOn the lino, then you use Indian ink, then you roll it on top of it, then you put it through a press. It's like a press, you know, what a press does when they do printing for newspapers and all that. It's sort of different. This is an idea, but it goes in a different perspective, like back to front, but it goes the right way we wanted it.\nSo you have to line it up, and roll it through and then the next step you get to start, you get the first stage, you gotta use six different colors, overlay different color layers of colors, ink, Indian ink, and it's very, very good too. It keeps me going.\nWhat is it about art that made you want to do it? Was it to tell a story? Was it to represent your culture?\nWell, you know, arts always said, all this arts is coming to be something that's more creative in your mind, in your mind that you want to create something. So like wood carving, you want to make...\nCarve out a dugong on the wood. So you carve, it's how you create, how you create that image. In an art, it's a flowing thing. It's an expression. It sort of gives you the reality of what you see and what you know. And then you can sort of use the brush as you, as a...\nAs your heart and your mind take you to it and you create something. Aboriginal art, it's unique.\nAre you comfortable talking me through, you showed me an artwork at the hospital and you had a snake.\nYeah.\nAre you comfortable talking through that and what the story is?\nThe story there that when we tell the story of that, that when I done at the hospital with the Gabul dreaming, see? So it was the snake that came down from Herbert River, came all the way down and he came all the way down and he...\nAnd broke into pieces and then he came through and went up that way and landed on and came down that way to see where he came to Palm, made his way to Palm and then...\nAnd then we came to a water hole with bamboo cricks. And that snake lays there. And then the old family said, no, you can't go up there. Tell the daughters not to go up there swimming. You're not allowed to go up there swimming. But they went up and then went for a swim there.\nAnd then the snake took them all the way up. That way he ran all the way up to, going up to Mount Bentley, all the way around. And then the Gabul snake came down to, they call it, Barbara Bay. And there you got, you have Gabul Snake Creek there. And the land, it was all water, no water was there.\nCrawled all the way up to a place called Mad Daddy Garland and he went to Mad Daddy. The old man, the old father, he was a clever man too. And he trailed, he followed the tracks all the way and went all the way all over. And he came down to Gabul Snake Creek where the snake went through. Then today there, you go around there,\nAnd then you see that creek there still running. It's called the Carpacini Creek, around where Barbara Bay is, and then Osho Bay there, in between there. And it went all the way over to Magnetic. And then they found him there, found him there.\nHe asked, that Gabul snake didn’t ask him not to kill him. And he said, take the daughter, take the girl and brought her back. And he didn’t want to kill the snake, so the snake, he said, he let the snake go. And he went, grabbed the girl and went back to Palm. And the girl was sick, so the old man just healed her.\nToday and today, you see that when he go, that Gabul snake, he let him go because he went up to the Ross River and he created the Ross River and that was it. That’s the whole story connected.\nWhy did that story sort of connect you to you and why did you end up painting it? Was there a reason or was it just a feeling?\nWell, the Gabul, it’s a totem. And it’s a story connection to country, and the dreaming, and the connection with our dreamings connected to the island. The same as the creator, he created all these islands too, also.\nWhen he came then, all the way from, came across to Herbert River, he came through Herbert, came down to Herbert, created that Herbert River, then came through it, and all the way landed and came to Palm. And from there, he went over there to Magnetic, and Magnetic went straight up to and created Ross River. And the story, and it's come back again to us.\nAnd it’s connected with us too, with our dreaming, with Gabul dreaming. And it also gives us the thoughts that we’re here with Herbert River. It’s where all that area, it’s where we all come down with descendants and families. We come from up Tableland all the way down and to Palm and the connection there and all over too.\nAnd that’s why, that’s why Dad or grandfather would always say, we’re under the umbrella of the Rukurrukaba country.\nUkurukaba, this oldest big area that we cover under, we are called Kunu people. Ukurukaba means Kunu people. It’s very special. Yeah, it’s a little special. And we also associate with Banyan, Hinchinbrook Banyan.\nNowagi, over that side, Waihingum and all that area. And also come down to Rukurrukaba, Ulkuru and Bindal, all that area there. And all this connection has come under the umbrella of Rukurrukaba country. We’re all Kunu people.\nHow do new people come onto the island and understand that? Like the complexity and the simplicity of that? How do you best welcome people, I guess, in the right way, and how can people come in the right way?\nWe welcome them and sometimes we go, we take them, when they come, we take them around the way, the casement there where the story tree is. We do a smoking ceremony, we welcome them and bring them into the country so that they can also be protected from bad spirits. And let them enjoy themselves on Palm and welcome them on Great Palm itself.\nBukkuman Parah. Bukkuman Parah means Great Palm Island and welcome them all over. Everyone over Great Palm and enjoy themselves. And they go back.\nWhat’s the... I don’t know what the question is, but... Palm’s been through a journey of many things.\nYeah, Palm’s been through a lot. You get... you get... you get Benedict, like, strikes. Hundred years celebration. And... and... Bookman holidays, you know.\nAnd you also have the memories of our brother, Peter Fry, who would tell the stories of having shot curry. And that’s a respect for... that’s the story that, his stories, and it’s still celebrated today.\nAnd respected. That’s how we give them the opportunity to show their respect, and we show our respect. And that’s how we show our respect.\nHow do you think about yourself around some of the tougher times that have happened on Palm Island?\nYou think about it, and it’s part of the journey, or is it something in which, like, happened but you need to move on? Like, what’s the... how do you feel about what happened back in the time?\nSometimes I’m not too sure, you know. Life’s...\nPeople want to live in a beautiful tropical island. It’s beautiful, but the responsibility, we go back in the time, we look at it. When you go back under the Act, when you look at the old pictures, old photos, beautify that island, it’s all clean. And it’s just like that. We’ve been under the Act, see?\nWe were like prisoners, and we showed that we cleaned places up. But when the Act was gone, we were free. We can do what we like. We’ll do what we can. And the purpose is that we can’t change. We’ve got to go forward and try to develop and sometimes move on.\nAnd there’s also a time for celebration. And I don’t know. There’s some amazing things happening on Palm Island. There’s some tough things as well that people are working through.\nWhat’s some of the things that you hope will happen over the next maybe like 10 to 20 years on Palm? Are there things in which you’re hopeful about?\nI want to remember that, hopefully, that everybody be all together as one and work together and respect each other and celebrate what we can. Keep Palm... keep Palm beautiful and keep going ahead, going ahead in the future. And that’s what I look at.\nBut for myself, I like to develop something for myself and bring something. Maybe we can, because Palm's going to be around when they have tourism coming,\nPeople that we need to work in and develop, you know, business and all that on Palm. So I want to try and do something for... have a little place for where we can bring young people back into culture, learning things that are, that are vulnerable at Palm.\nI think culture is most important. People will stay focused on things that happened back there, but history...\nCan repeat itself, you know. But we got to go, we got to use every resource that our culture will go forward and keep it with our young generation coming up. And nobody with a telephone or mobile phones in this beautiful place where this whole inspiration is all around us. Everything’s here.\nSo you told me a really inspiring vision yesterday.\nYeah, I was going to bring it up one day.\nI’d love for you to...\nTalk through what that vision is.\nI was saying that I was talking about it, trying to bring it out and trying to bring it so I can explain it.\nI felt the segue was good.\nYeah, try to bring it in and try to explain it, how I’m going to do it.\nYeah.\nI was there last night. We should have talked about it.\nBut you’re going to start working, is it on?\nI’ll edit it.\nYeah.\nI can ask you specific questions about it.\nWell, I was looking at North East Bay, and I was trying to think of that I was going to do that just to make it a little camping place for young kids and kids that seek...\nI’m thinking of a word that might bring it up in a language name, but it’s \"seek and you shall find.\"\nAnd it sort of creates culture in perspective, where you can see it or believe it or you don’t. It’s up whether it’s with your heart, whether you want it to happen.\nCulture is most important. That’s why I want to create this camping, so that maybe they don’t go to school, maybe they like to, but education comes first.\nAnd also, culture brings in the... I don’t know, it’s just, it’s what I’m thinking of. I’m trying to bring it in a picture where I can make it happen, but it’s...\nSome other people help, you know, like teachers, police, or whoever can be involved with it too, you know, more creative.\nBut it’s most important—culture first. Culture.\nCan you explain like where it is and why that place is significant, do you think, for where you want it to be?\nLorde’s Bay is beautiful. It’s quiet.\nThe beach, the water, and also it has everything there. You just have your mind thinking back and start bringing people, bringing culture back into it.\nCamping, walking back, walkabout, bush walking,\nGo seek other places and story connection too, connecting and hunting and fishing. It’s all that part of culture. We get to learn to hunt, you get to feed yourself, you get to learn to say go into the store or shops.\nMaybe now I’ll try to check everything out. That’s why I wanted to start up my vision. It’s a vision I always use because it’s away from everything.\nAnd it was isolated there. You know, also comfort and quietness.\nYeah.\nAlso, you can do your paintings and all that, and art, and create, make some shields or spears or create something.\nAnd it brings you back to...\nBrings you back to reality with culture that you want to do. And it’s what you want to do to help you go forward, to help you be more a person.\nAnd what do you think that does for a young person who is currently struggling a little bit with the system and school and stuff? Why does that experience help them, do you think?\nI know I’ve been there at school. I was struggling. I learned a few, my English and mainly my maths, but it wasn’t helping much. But it’s just looking, just that you’ve got to try harder.\nPut yourself, work harder, try to, and focus on, maybe you could get some friends around the school, help you out, keep encouraging you, parents encourage you if you need it, teachers are there too, if they need it, friends there, if you need it. All they gotta do is just...\nAnd what difference do you think having strong elders to be able to talk to makes for young people? And like how do you, with a place like that, how do you...?\nCulturally, like I go back to culture and then see your Palm, you have 40 different, 40 or 30 different tribes on the island, and each of them come from a different country, see? Different places where they come, because they come under the umbrella of Bulgaman people, and they're 32 different tribes, and as a young generation, each will have to seek and find where their connections are.\nWe’re not gonna say we’re gonna send you away back up there. You’re free to go up there back to your grandfather’s country and come back. That’s how you generate yourself to be who you really are, who you’re connected to, where your connections are. And you also go there to visit your families and your relatives.\nAnd say that, oh, my grandfather’s name was there. I was back to my grandfather’s country and come back to Palm because in that way, that sort of builds you up, see? So you know who you are. Where I come from, I got my mother, my mother is a Giribau.\nShe’s up in Madagascar. Madagascar is a whole new country. My mother and grandmother, they all worked at the station. They worked at a station called Kunawara. Kunawara Station. And then we go out there, but our grandfather, my mother, my mother’s dad, grandmother, grandmother, she said that Baja Balanar changed it to...\nKirama Station, changing to Bajabala Station, which means \"two rivers meet.\" And it’s almost not far from where the Blinko Falls are. They went up there, Mount Garnet area, that side. And that’s where the Blinko Falls, that’s where Warrung Country and Guggenbaden, yeah.\nAnd that’s where my mother’s country is, up that way, Tableland. And then I come back down here where Dad’s country is Mumbara. And here we go, Boogerman Burra. Boogerman Burra is Great Palm Island and Mumbara.\nSo how long was this?\nWe’re doing good. We’re going to beat Richard.\nOh my God, I’m going to get so bummed.\nYeah, I know.\n36 minutes, all right.\nLong, isn’t it?\nYou’re so good.\nOh, now you got to break it up and make sure it comes to the old meat. I want to look at it, see where anything goes wrong. I got to make sure.\nOh, yeah. That’s the best part.\nWe need to, we need to, we need to, we got to correct it first.\nI didn’t want to.\nYeah.\nWhat do you think young fellas’ journey through this life is like? I don’t know if it’s expectation or there’s something around understanding your culture, but then they’ve got this other world, this Western-type construct that they need to work out.\nHow do they do that? Like, is that something that... Do you think that’s why some young people are struggling so much?\nYeah. When you have these sort of things like, you know, back in the old days, we used to go walk up and look around for fruit, you know, look around for cherry trees and plums and all that, back in those days.\nWe used to go down the jetty, get some oysters. Then at the beachside, get some oysters. These were the good times back in those days.\nAnd we, you know, we walk about, we free walkabout and then take our spear, go spearfishing, go fishing, you know, around the bay and all that.\nBut the next generation, when the time, it’s all been changed because they lack, lack of this because of mobile phones are coming around and...\nAmericanized and they talking like American, as the gangsters, and talking like, and I said, oh, you’re not American, you’re bloody Aboriginal.\nWhere’s you?\nYou get mobile phones and you get all kinds of things. You get scooters, you get things that are made today, but back in our days...\nAll we had was a little foot. We walked around like we used to always do.\nBut now these days, it’s slowly, but sometimes we have to try and change, but it’s not.\nSometimes also religion plays a game in all our life too. Religion, churches. But church is good. It helps. I’m not religious, but I’m a Christian. I believe in God, you know.\nBut I also wanted to show that our first priority is to believe the way what we believe, you know. Either you want to be what you want to be. You know, we make our choices.\nBut then again, we’ve got cultural perspective too, and it might combine, but, you know...\nWe use it as what God has shown us to use it the right way. And not to kill one another. And, you know, we live as a peaceful people.\nBut I’m talking about back in the time, see, when we were all, when we had this freedom of going hunting...\nGet some cherry trees or get some plums. And guava, there was the days when we had that.\nBut now, when we go back to mobile phones and all that, we change all that. TV, telephones, even shopping used to go out there.\nWe used to go to the shop all the time and push the trolley.\nNow, it’s all that. You drive a car.\nYou can’t walk anymore, you get too used to the car, because, oh, I’m getting too lazy now. I need to drive a car.\nAnd it’s all changing.\nWe used to go out to the camping, we used to carry a little bag with blankets and all that.\nBut now you’ve got a caravan coming around and you can use a caravan.\nYou could get a tent and they could make a tent.\nWe used to make them all, a little old hut and camp underneath it.\nBut now everything’s changed, young generation.\nBut it also, protections, that’s all it needs, your protection and your health.\nWhat do you think’s going to change?\nI’d rather be back there, but now you’ve got to go forward now and make the best of it.\nBut still believe in what you can do for the young generation.\nFirst thing first.\nMake sure they get back, first priority is their culture first.\nAnd maybe they can...\nSit down and talk about what they do. You could use your mobile phone, but put it away.\nThen you can come and we’ll go walkabout, camp, and bring your mobile phone along, take photos of what we’re doing, see?\nYou create something. And sharing with culture, what you can create your mobile phone to do. And make sure that you sort of keep a continuation of history, of what you’ve been doing. And people say, oh, this is Bush Tucker. Take a photo. And that keeps it in there. It’s like your memory.\nThere are some kids that end up getting caught up in this. There’s a system called youth justice or youth detention. Is there an alternative to that that you can offer in the Palm Island community that helps those young people to change and understand how to live without committing crime or getting in trouble? Or do they have to go to prison?\nWell, things are going out of line sometimes, you know. We try our best. But focus back on the parents. Parents have a responsibility. And also, kids can do all kinds of things the wrong way.\nJust growing up, you know. Growing up. That’s all it is. Growing up too fast. Not slowing them down. Meet them on the right track. Make sure they go where they...\nExpect to be, not expect to be, to go where you want them to go. But it’s all about... I don’t know how you could put it. I haven’t got a kid of my own, but I just got my nephews and my niece and grandchildren.\nWould be my brothers and sisters. And try to keep them in the right direction and make sure they stay on that. And also mainly because when you go back in the old ways, you’ve got to have that respect. Family respect. You respect your elders. You respect your elders and you respect...\nYou respect your mother, you respect your father, you respect your brother, and also the families around you. The most important is your elders. You must respect your elders.\nBack in the old days, if you don’t listen, listen and hear, listen to what they say, you get a clip over the ears. You do the wrong thing, you get a clip over the ears.\nBut nowadays, kids can do what they like now. But even it’s up to ourselves, we can make a change, we can change it. We can use every resource that brings them...\nBring that respect back into the families, bring it back into the kids and all that. Your elders come first.\nYeah.\nIf over the next few years Palm Island starts to develop tourism as well...\nThe gentleman, he’s seen us out here. He’s checking us out.\nYeah, he was standing there looking.\nWas he?\nYeah.\nHe said, what are you doing here?\nNo way I’m getting out of here. There’s someone down there.\nSure.\nYeah, we just got a visit over the horse. He got up and just came and visited us. He wanted to join in the interview.\nSorry about that.\nIf Palm Island in the next five or ten years starts to develop tourism and more people start to come, what would you hope that they take away or that they...\nFeel when they’re here? What are the things that you think are most important for them?\nWell, it’s most important that Palm can give, what Palm can provide, and Palm can produce. Tourism can be the opportunity for themselves to develop themselves and become a...\nWhatever they expect it to be. You know, like more money, more work. We have more people working, more Wulgurukaba people, more people working together to develop something. And when tourists come, they want to see culture.\nIt’s the first priority. They want to see what Palm can produce, what Palm can have. Say, maybe we can have a dancing group. Maybe we can have a camping group.\nMaybe we can have tourism for looking at the Mingna Mingna Ranges to develop the tourist brand all over, everywhere, and touring up the hill. Mingna Mingna Ranges can control the sea and the land also.\nAnd also mainly to come back to respect the traditional owners and also the people here too, also respected as the Wulgurukaba people. And Mambara also to be a first priority.\nAnd we wanted to go forward and bring everybody forward with us, work together.\nCan you see the bay down here if you walk up there or not?\nUp here?\nYeah.\nWe can walk up.\nCan you see it?\nYeah.\nOh, my leg. I’m going to jump on that horseback.\nOh, get up.\n\n"

'cause save me moving my bunks. My bunk is too heavy and I need something where likely easy to move around.\n\n\\~~Yeah. Next we're gonna try and think about a washing machine. Okay. Is that something you think that the community or your, that's why I need, yeah, that's why we need in our community, why we got a lot of old people there.\\~~\n\n",

        "# Zero\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAlright, just clap my hands. Cool. So you're just looking at me. Don't worry about this thing. So just tell me your name, or name or whatever, and spell it first. Okay. Zero ZE. O Cool.\n\nI'm a musician. I'm an artist. I studied psychology at university. I live on the streets. I've been, yeah, I've been staying in tents. I've been staying at shelter and in hostels for the past two years. It's an adventure.\n\nOrange Sky's great. They're really helpful because just the practical things whilst your houseless, like trying to do your laundry can be a challenge. So the fact that you guys come out to the locations.\n\nNear day space and near the Uniting Church. That's where people get free food. For those who don't know, it's really helpful. It's really helpful just being able to do your laundry whilst you're doing everything else in the day. It's just, it's one more thing that we don't have to worry about. So it's appreciated and volunteers and connection and communication and stuff.\n\n[00:01:00] If isolation is like the struggle of modern society, then connection to communities, the antidote.\n\nI think it's practical. It's practical, more so than anything. It's awesome. Also it speaks to what people that are living on the streets need in a wider sense is access to facilities . There's two types of facilities that would benefit from having community access to the first is necessary.\n\nUtilities like kitchen, shower, laundry. 'cause there aren't spaces where you can just go to do those necessary living function things for free. And the second, third space that would be amazing to see more so in the community is free spaces just to be and to build community from, for example a clothing exchange, like free clothing exchange, a place with couches, with a kitchen, with a lounge, just to hang out during the daytime.\n\nA place where there's a free bookshelf, a place that [00:02:00] encourages free trade. 'cause if you can facilitate an environment where people can help people, that's the best way to solve things. Most people are generous especially people that are in difficult situations. You'll see a lot of compassion because it's valued and we know how far, like a little help goes when things are rough. So if we could have spaces that are built around that mentality of give a little, get a little, a free space with facilities, that's what would really help in this situation. Built specifically, not so much around the idea of charity.\n\nAround community, around free trade, around art, around sharing knowledge and just helping each other.\n\nSo a great example of this that we need to see more of is street to stage. So I dunno if you know what that is. No. So street to stage is, it's run the past two years. The first was at Simple Sider and the second was.\n\nYouth arc. And so it was an opportunity for [00:03:00] people that had experienced houselessness or were currently experiencing houselessness to get up and play music or do poetry on stage. And that was so awesome 'cause it was bringing together people and sharing stories around a shared passion for music, which was so cool.\n\nAnd the energy was great. Oh, by the way, this is another point. The term homelessness. Is inaccurate. It should be houselessness because anybody who's in the situation understands the difference between a house and a home. House, four walls home, that feeling of love, and you can have that sense of home with you if you have community wherever you are, and if you have connection to the earth and to yourself, that's home.\n\nA house, just a place, so nobody can actually judge another being to say that they are homeless because that is something that we determine for ourselves. So I would say that I'm houseless. I don't have a house, but I am home wherever I go. I think that's important that we should change the language around that to better reflect the [00:04:00] situation as opposed to.\n\nAnd reduce the stigma a little bit. We're all people of this planet, who is anyone to say that anyone is homeless? Are we not still just beings altogether? There's no difference. It's no difference.\n\nRight now, in order to get access to those things for free people in this situation need to access them. At specific places at specific times, which can be a little bit inconvenient if you've got like a busy schedule or if you have work or all of those different things.\n\nSo it'd be great to have more free access hubs and also third spaces. To relax because in a heavily capitalistic society, there's emphasis on doing in all places. There's always a function, there's always an economic exchange. Whereas if we had places where it was accepted just to be and to exist. We could facilitate connections and friendships growing more organically and strengthen the community that way, as opposed to it being like, okay, you're in this spot to buy a [00:05:00] coffee.\n\nNobody talks to each other. This look at the phone. No. If it was just a place where we could all just be, that's, I think that would actually help the spirit of the city free spaces.\n\nStarting with the man in the mirror, like we lead by example and if each of us becomes the best we can be.\n\nThat's the true way to see the world get better, individuals making a difference in their own lives and that rippling out to see awesome change in the community.\n\nI don't know the gentleman personally, but from my experience with Orange Sky, it was a brilliant idea and keeping community at the core.\n\nOf any service is the way to keep a good vibe. Let them know. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nI really want a motorbike. That's my big, that's cool. Yeah, because once I have a motorbike, I can camp and I'll be the cool kind of houseless, not the street kind of houseless like Yeah. I don't know. [00:06:00] It's difficult also, if you've been living day to day for a while, just dealing with existence and the fundamentals.\n\nIf there isn't really a foundation, it's really difficult to actually plan ahead. When anybody asks me about the future, I'm like that doesn't exist. No, tomorrow. That does not exist.\n\nThere's several ways that I think that I can help and like conversations like these, if I have an idea. I wanna share that with the world, like more third spaces or letting you guys know about the issue with the hostels and stuff.\n\nSo here we go. Here's some knowledge I've learned, pass it on. But also self-improvement and being mindful in the way that I show up in day-to-day interactions with people and trying to just be kind. Which sounds simple, but I feel is huge. And also I'm thinking like music and art, definitely ideas are powerful.\n\nSpreading ideas is powerful, but the groundwork and just helping people out is also powerful and important. [00:07:00] It's all equally important, but what I'd like to do is make music so good that it just changes the world and makes everybody realize that the concept of housing is absurd and everything should be free and we can all live in peace.\n\nAnd I'll write a song that powerful and beautiful that everyone finally realizes that and then everything will be peaceful. There you go. That's my world domination plan. That's pretty, yeah, that's, yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah, I can, yeah, I'd love to hear that song. Yeah, me too. I'm still working on it.\n\nWhat, you got a particular. Genre of music you like more than others to play or to do? It depends on my mood. Like I do piano, guitar, singing, and electronic. So a bit of everything. Yeah. That's diverse. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Let's go take a photo. Cool.\n"

        "# Iris\n\n\n## Introduction and Early Years\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nAll right, I'm ready. Hold on there. There's my grandson there. You see him? Oh, when you come in, you see him? When you coming from the,\n\nyou see him when you come in from the airport. Tell me about him.\n\nI'll tell you about my mum pants. Yeah. Oh, sorry about this. It's all right. Take your time.\n\nYou take a photo of him? Yep. Yeah. I took two photos of him in the mirror, had all the photos that picked him.\n\nAh, so good. Oh, I went across. There we go. [00:01:00] Cool.\n\nWhere do I start? Start with your name. So if you can say your full name and then spell it, that would be the best place to start.\n\nOkay. You on? Yeah. Yeah. Hi everyone. My name is Iris. I'm a for foot. My parents were born here, Norman America for Foot. Eh, dad is from Bowan, the BI area, and. And mom. My grandmother, Audrey, she was from ow. My dad her father was from Maribo, Chileo area. They were moved to Palm and my mom met my dad in 19, 19 35.\n\nI think they would've met up together and. [00:02:00] 39. Oh, sorry. My mom and dad my mom was born in 1939. They were sent she was born here. This is where she was she went with different family, like families rna, the Maca boy family, she had a lot of friends, my mom, but she was put in the dormitory because her mom had other children.\n\nBut the real memory I've got of my parents together, they had, they got married and a IM church and in 19 1959. 1960. Of course, I came along. Then my sister Ivy, Diane, and Norman. We lived in an area called bottom end. Then we were moved up into another area to stick with the tribes.\n\nI believe my grandfather's wife was from out west, a Ative [00:03:00] lady. Yeah. And anyway we moved back down to the other end of the island. My mom and dad had no way of feeding us, my father to find ways to, to feed my sister, myself, my sisters, and myself. So they. I love the story about them.\n\nMy dad built a boat and the little boat was named Ivy May, after my other two sisters, Ivy and Diane May, and they, he, I dunno where he got the wood from, but he managed to scrap all the wood up to just to make this little boat and made the paddles. He made a wamp and he had spears and they rode to. To Possum Island.\n\nThey did it like monthly, every month. She would hunt for turtle at night and they'd sleep [00:04:00] over there and catch the tide coming back. And we'd all wait on the beach getting happy 'cause we had food, turtle and fish and possum, whatever they can gather over there. We came, yeah, they came home with the tail.\n\nThey'll cut it up in front of, on the beach in front of other families and they'd share it. My dad would share it or sell aate for a dollar, $5. But he was a good cook. He knew how to cook a rice, cook it down. But there were main important things that they, that we had to eat fish. Rice was filling and the damper was filling.\n\nThere was no bread back then. And he made spears. But one year it was one we went, we moved back up to the other end of the island. 'cause we had a, we went into our new home and we had to go away for school, but then the canteen was open and. [00:05:00] My mom and dad was drinking. They fell in a trap where, and us kids used to ran, run away with our grandmother.\n\nAudrey I, one the fondest memory, and I always think about it, how did they get to, to make a boat and to make those paddle and the, the tools to catch our food, the food, the turtle, and the fish and row and the exercise my mom had to row too as well. She's only a small woman and when they bought the food back, it fed us and we was happy and content with it.\n\nWith that. Until the canteen was open, I spoke about the canteen. They fell in that trap and we were, my mom and dad really wanted us to go to school, so they'd sent us out to a place in South Townsville. It was called a around [00:06:00] house. I went there, I enjoyed it, but my education level was so low that the sisters there put me back to grade six.\n\nGrade seven to catch up. I stayed there and done grade 12 and Mar 10 and Margaret Mary. I was happy with that. My other two sisters dropped out. They did come out but caused the low level of education that we had. They couldn't go further. I got that extra support but I never thought much of it.\n\nIt was education and I stayed doing my own thing for two years. Then I had my children,\n\nbut\n\nI felt that it was a relationship where I had the kids without the father. Anyway, I went on to. To working at the school 'cause I had lower self-esteem and I was invited to go to the school, do some reading [00:07:00] with the kids, which helped me with my level of reading so I could start from there up and learn more.\n\nI stayed there for five years, I think, and teacher aid that promoted me to teacher aid and I loved that job. It was, help discipline the kid and remind them that education is really important. Then my partner then we had been going to church. I thought, oh, we gotta do it right by God and get married.\n\nSo we did, but he died of cancer, so it left me as a widow with the kids. I moved from the school 'cause I couldn't, I just moved and went to the women's shelter. I helped women who were struggling with domestic family violence and single women who were struggling in their lives. I stayed there for six years.\n\nI had time to, [00:08:00] then it closed 'cause by then. \n\n\n## Transition and New Beginnings\n\nNew organization came in and took control of it. So I was left out for a couple of years. I didn't work. \n\n\n## Meeting My Partner and Career Shift\n\nI met my now partner. We, there was a job going at the rehab, so we took that advantage and he drove the bus and became a case worker here.\n\n\n## Current Role and Reflections\n\nAt thirties and knowing that alcohol and drug affecting our kids, I stayed in December. I've celebrated my 13 years here, which I'm really happy I did. With the take of the new company now, I feel it's still important to stay open in regards to drug and alcohol and other drugs as well. My age now is 65, probably 65 this year.\n\nI think I done my share in this community. I find my children are all [00:09:00] respectful. There's one of them that's in and outta jail, but he'll come around. And my daughters, I've always reminded them, don't rob your children of schooling. Make sure you send 'em to school every day. Education is important and their health and wellbeing is too.\n\nMy mom, we're waiting to move into our new home now at bottom end, and all she wants to do is go out camping just to laying on the beach and fishing. So I'm looking forward to that. We've leased some land at the other end of the island and we are gonna we're currently. And I ask someone to build these camps up and it'll be my camp, my children camp.\n\nAnd they're gonna learn the skills of living out there in the bush, living off the land. Back then we only had that one boat. We walked, so walked right down there. It was fun. We was in our team on matter back then. [00:10:00] Now. It's, you gotta get a boat here and a boat there, and boat everywhere. But I'm in no condition to walk either my mom yeah.\n\nI'm currently now stationed at thirties. I love it here. I love being around the people. I know our, we got one aim and goal is to help our people who are struggling. With alcohol, drug and other issues wellbeing. Yeah. And thank you. Amazing. Thank you for listening. Can you tell me about your lineage, your family you were talking about before?\n\nHow does, what's order, does that go in your family? My mom, she lost a son and was traumatized by it. And then. I come along in the sixties and I think I was a little perfect kid then to my parents. Then there's another my sister come along, Ivy and my other sister Diane. [00:11:00] And then my brother and my other sister.\n\nSo I'm the eldest of my, my family, my entire family, my mom's family the Alice in our clan group. I feel mom will respect me. It goes to a, I have to respect them too and understand them too like they do respect me. But. Yeah, that's me. What's where I stand in my family. And how many kids and grandkids do you have?\n\nI have seven, seven children. Pretty sure it's 2023. 23. 23 grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Yeah. It's good to remember those. Yeah. Do you remember all their names? No. We had a, we, when we went [00:12:00] to top end of Liv, we was like, I was kissing my mom. We need to have a Christmas dinner or Christmas breakfast.\n\nMom might be here next year. Then we have another one, then another one. But we're going back in our home and we'll probably have another one. A nice gathering together. Yeah. Yeah. What is it that about Palm Island that's special for you? Is it just because you are connected here or is it something about the place now or special because it's home, it's nowhere.\n\nThere's no place like home. Sometime I wish I could travel. But that's not me. It's a\n\nI would've traveled when I was in my thirties, forties, but no special Parmesan. And I don't think I ever lived. Yeah, I might for you a few weeks, but. Yeah. What do you think about the future of Palm Island? Are you confident in that it's gonna have a good future or are you worried where's [00:13:00] your head up with that?\n\nWith the future? I believe today's generation, we have to educate the kids. We have to make sure they go to school. We need to make sure they're in a safe environment away from the alcohol and drug away from abuse. So they can learn when they're at school. Yeah, it's important that it's important that the kids go to school, even my children and their children make sure they go to school and have a safe environment at home that they can come out to.\n\nYeah. What do you think your mom would say about the future of Palm Island and the current stuff? Does she ever talk about what she thinks about the future? Oh, I didn't do that when I was young. I done this. I had to do that, and yeah. Yeah, she'll compare sometimes. Yeah. Especially with in regards to alcohol and drugs.\n\nAnd how does it work with getting a lease on Palm Island and doing that stuff? Is that simple or is that hard? Oh, we went and got, you allowed to go and fill a paper up at the council office [00:14:00] and say, you want this piece? And they put up on the billboard and people don't, if people dispute our they'll say so.\n\nBut nothing's been said with the place I'm leasing at the moment. And is it a transaction with money? Is that how it works? Yes. I have to, once I get the camp up, I'll do that and hopefully they'll keep a record of what's been done so my children can pay that amount to keep up the lease. Yeah.\n\nWhat sort of a sort of place do you think you will build there? What sort of just a camp. I think we can have a camp at that area, but that if the lease is there say another 20 years. When they do fix the road up where we're going that spot is just beautiful. The lease is there will whether my kids or grandchildren are obligated to, and the lease, they, I know I'm open, but I gotta go and talk to em, empower the myself and in regards to land.\n\nYeah. What sort of [00:15:00] structures do you think you'll building? Will you build them or other people or? I had in mind, I've already got the kitchen up sort of thing. And three little rooms, a camping area and a veranda and a place where you can, and you can put your tents near the fireplace and we're looking out to certain areas and we'll have a better history of the certain areas.\n\nI'm hoping schools will go and use it. 'cause it's nice, it's dangerous. There's current there, but my kids know not to go to a certain area where it's, yeah. They only used it a couple of times, so once it's billed, maybe we can use it. And how do you get there, there now? Do you need I've got a boat and I've got a couple boats I found, we've gotta transport behind timber and whatnot. Needed there? Yeah. I'm looking how far is on the boat from the port? It's [00:16:00] right down the end of that island. Oh, okay. Right down there. At the end of the point, my family, my mom's family lived there. Oh, awesome. And yeah, they lived there for some times.\n\nTheir uncles and their mom used to go to then camp as well, yeah, A better history and the family that's there using it, they know my mom. See. And the history of the place itself. How many people do you think have leases and camps in different parts? I don't know. I've seen a lot on the billboard.\n\nThey even there's family that leased on in Possum Island. I think the family here at least. The other island. That island across the family. Yeah. Yeah. And what's it like when you go there? What do, what's the activities? Is it a lot of what do you do when you go there? Where do I go? Where, when you go to your Lees, where, what do you do?\n\nThe kids, we line them up all on the beach and they just play all day. But they're all row now. I'm trying to get that fo [00:17:00] where they're all laying on the beach to show 'em and put it up in the camp. This is here. This is a you here and some sense of ownership around that little area that we've leased.\n\nYeah. I was talking to Uncle Alan. He wants to put a camp over the young kids. I think it's over this way that he might have access to Northeast Bay. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And what's have you got any hopes and dreams for what this birdies can become in the future? Are you hoping other people can come stay here in the future, or?\n\nI hope they turn it into a residential area where you see it for a few years and we'll still operate care for run programs for people who what you call it, in that boundary. We got problem with alcohol and drugs and they're all here. Our people are here who are struggling to break that chain, that bonded that's there.\n\nAnd no way I [00:18:00] known how to get help from, for it. I believe this was the elder's dream to help people who struggle with Yeah. With alcohol and drugs. To become a better person. Now there's more out there, but we're gonna understand that transgenerational trauma. Yeah. And this generation of changes has changed so much.\n\nPalm Island. And then people wanna, if you need to recover, you wanna get help, you need to get help for yourself. Yeah. You were saying a about the church before. Do you go to church? That is that Yeah. My mom and I went to church up there, a IM church and my mom shared with the group from Melbourne.\n\nShe said to them, I got married in that church over here. Yep. Yes, she got married in the church and uncle Frank. Was in the same classes there, so there's hardly any elder [00:19:00] elders left. Uncle Frank lives near Uncle Allen down there. Yeah. Yeah. We were supposed to go back to church 'cause little sentiment value we looked at in the knowledge center there was this photo we looked at.\n\nYeah. My mom was in that photo they had gathering in the yard. And outage in the yard and other thing, pray, praise and worship in the yard. So I think is sentiment of values to the church, not just for the marriage, but we were regular. Church goes back then, we had no choice in our grandfather. Always went to church.\n\nYeah. Do you, what do you think about the history of Palm Island in terms of. Do you think about some of the negative stuff that happened in the history as well, or do you try not to think about it too much? During my time and learning about it and in a lot of training that we went through the kids gotta understand what the elders that went through that, [00:20:00] what they went through, and I think finding their history and where they come from.\n\nWould help. Or even if you know your own tribe, you know your own family. I think that laia too, to have a sense of who am I? Who am I? Where did I come, where did my grandparents come from?\n\nAnything we didn't get to talk about that you? 'cause I think one thing we'll I'd love to do is work out, I think I'm gonna come back on the 2nd of June in two weeks. And I'd love to find out who in your family would like to have a conversation that could connect up with your conversation.\n\nThink your mom and happy use. Yeah, my mom, she'd be happy to sit down with you. She's she's been through a lot and we can do it super simple and in a real complic way. Yeah, you can, we can [00:21:00] go home. We help home and sit down and yarn, take the boat out to the lease.\n\nYeah. Yeah, my mom. All right. I think she'll like to sit with you. Yeah. If I'm present there and my partner. Yeah. And what's your partner's name? Sorry? Clay. Clay. Clay. And how long you been with Clay? Oh, it's been a while now. 2010. So we turned 50 together and we turned 60 together and we're probably, we're turning 25 65 together.\n\nThat's great. Yeah. That's awesome. Cole, I'm just gonna take a couple of photos. Oh, I'm not gonna be a model now.\n"

        "Linda Turner\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nA bit of atmos sound from the people behind. Okay. So you can just talk to me. Yep. This is invisible. Um, so we need to do is like say your full name mm-hmm. And then spell it so I don't get it wrong. Okay. What's your full name and spell it? My name is Linda Turner. L-I-N-D-A-T-U-R-N-A. And what do people call you though, LT?\n\nMy initial thumb. And the reason for that is because it's a cultural reason. Um, and it's. An elder passed away with the same name. So in our culture, we're not allowed to use deceased people's names. Sometime it can be for a few years, but sometimes in other groups it's forever. Yeah. How do you like to introduce yourself, like in terms of your background or identity?\n\nWhat's, what's way you do that? Um, well, I introduce myself as you know, Linda Turner, but known as lt. I'm a proud woman by woman. Um, born, um, [00:01:00] no, 160 kilometers north of Tennant Creek in the bush in the sixties. Yeah, so that's how I describe myself. I'm a Bush girl, grew up, um, for the first 13 years of my life.\n\nIn the bush. Yeah. That's awesome. What was that life sort of like, thinking about what life's like now? What's the differences? Uh, I had a, um, deadly um, um, childhood, um, growing up on a, in the bush on a cattle station, um, and. There was no alcohol or violence. So, um, that story about a village, it takes a village to grow children up.\n\nUm, it was certainly true in my case 'cause everyone in the, in the camp, you know, looked out for all the kids. Wow. And what's, um, what's the experience now for you here? Like, what's changed and what's happening? Oh, so much has changed. So much has changed. Not, not only in [00:02:00] our, in our cultural practices, but also, um.\n\nJust in life in general and, and laws and legislation and whatever from the mainstream side as well as, um, the most concerning thing, the loss of our. Um, language and culture. Mm mm There was, um, I think it was in the car before they were talking a little bit about the intervention. Yep. Was was that like a, a memorable big time for you, um, when that happened, or?\n\nYeah. It was a, it was a shocking time for all of us, um, for a lot of, because Aboriginal men were then made to be, um. Pedophiles and, um, um, child abuses and, and all, and every, all the men got, um, blamed for that. And, and even the good, there's good and bad in everybody. Mm-hmm. Um, every culture, every, um, race.\n\nSo [00:03:00] they felt as though. Some good men, good fathers, good grandfathers, good uncles actually got up and were very emotional and they said, I'm not like that. You know? So, and it's upsetting even. Um, as soon as they look at you, they think negatively. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that, and that's what I'd like to change too.\n\nIs there a long term effect of that? Um, is it still now happening? Of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a lot of. Even myself, you know, I feel as though I've, I'm pretty, you know, out there and I've traveled even the world, you know, girl from the bush, but I still get to be made to feel as though.\n\nBecause we all get, um, thrown over the one blanket. Underneath the one blanket. So an example was last week I was in Darwin and I asked this old non-indigenous, um, man for the, I went to ask him for the time and I said, [00:04:00] excuse me, can you tell me the time? No, no, no. Okay. I said, I'm just asking you. Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nI said, look, not, not all aboriginal people are Vegas. You know, so yeah. So we still put up with an example. Alright. Um, how do you, how do you put on a positive mindset and start to work towards like. Um, bigger things in community when there's so much of that stuff that's happened. How do you create a positive moving forward, uh, by example, I guess, you know, like in my family, you know, well, let's lead by example.\n\nYou know, I try, we try to, my sister and I in our family. Try to lead by example to our kids and grandkids. Yeah. But, um, we all feel the same. Uh, you know, some of us experience it on a daily basis, so. Maybe that's a, that's a reason why a lot of people dream. You know, some of us have made a choice, [00:05:00] you know, not to let it affect, we can say not to let it affect, but it does affect us.\n\nWhat, what are some of the things you are looking forward to doing? Like, are you, have you got some projects and plans for things? Yes. Yeah. Um, we, um, my business partner and I, we were trying to start up a little business, you know, um, sharing our culture. And our bush medicines and our bush tucker and, and, um, we wanna do it show tourists so that it's, um.\n\nIn the end, it'll bring understanding and, um, to know that they, you know, this is how we lived. And, um, my business partner's got a, Trisha's got a block of land here on Waramug country. So, um, we plan to run it from there and, and to get houses built out there with the help of, um, many friends, donations for.\n\nPhilanthropy. Um, that's a really hard word for me. [00:06:00] Philanthropy. Yeah. Philanthropy. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so we've had tremendous help. We've actually, um, gone to New South Wales, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, um, ball other places, talking about our dreams to, um, be able to design and, um. Live in houses that are culturally appropriate, climate friendly.\n\nUm, so that's a really big thing at the moment for us. You know, I'm very, um, inspirational to know that a lot of work goes into it. Mm-hmm. But, you know, um, how, how can people best support you, do you think? And, and in what way? Like. Um, I'm sure there's different ways people can support, but how, how are you trying to get it, I guess?\n\nYeah. But how would you like people to come and work with you? Um, well, you know, we've had tremendous amount of people working with us, um, for one of the houses for Norman's house. Um. Engineers, [00:07:00] architects. Um, so we've built really good relationships. Um, and when we first started talking about these things, um, it was quite groundbreaking for us because we actually, you know, one of them, um, said.\n\nWhat does designing your own house mean? You know, that's how, um, how different it is. Um, and I thought, well, we've never been asked, we've never been asked at what sort of house we'd like to live in. So this is a really exciting, exciting time. You know? Um, there's so much potential out there. Absolutely. Um.\n\nWhat would, it could, can you paint a picture of what you think it would look like when you feel successful? When you feel like it's new? Like what, what would it look like? Um, oh, we, Trisha and I talk about it often, um, that we have our own, um, houses out there, our two houses, one for her family, one for my family, as well as [00:08:00] Norman, who's already on the way.\n\nUm. We'd like to have a, um, a facility there, a shed or something where we can host tourists or people, um, to talk about our culture, show our bush medicines, um, and hopefully have people camp there, tourist camp there to um, you know, get a cultural experience. That's what we want to promote, um, through our businesses is.\n\nOur culture. Yeah. Um, a lot of people that provide resources talk about this idea of impact. Mm-hmm. Um, and I think sometimes it's difficult to align with a western ideal of impact. 'cause it's like a bunch of numbers, a bunch of made up shit. What, what do you think impact would be for you for out there like.\n\nHow would that look for you as a, as a, um, well, the impact we've, we've spoken about Trisha and I, is to, we're setting this up for our kids and grandkids and that [00:09:00] they'll even, you know, independence, um, having a, being in charge of your own destiny, I guess. Um, being able to live on your own place. Um, we, we were talking this morning about, um, training them to identify the bush medicines and the bush.\n\nWe were talking about that this morning. So, um, some of our kids are following us and it, and gradually we're not forcing them, but we always encourage 'em. This is, you know what, we wanna leave for you guys. Yeah. Mm. Awesome. Yeah. Um, how much of your energy is this going to take? Like what, what do you need to do and what, what can people do to help you with that energy, I guess?\n\nAh, you're only two people. How? Yeah. Um, come and stay with us and help us physically, maybe, you know, to build some structures. I don't know. I don't really know. I'm, I'm blown away by the help and support and the generosity of people [00:10:00] already, you know, um, the ones that have given all that money to build a first house.\n\nAnd, and just meeting people who really are inspired by this concept of culturally appropriate. You know, climate friendly housing\n\nis a doggy liking that.\n\nThe Piper likes it. Um, one last little question. Um, that's a good question. I, yeah. All I see is opportunities in all of these communities. Um, like I'd love to see like what, what happens here? Spread. Yeah. How, how do you feel about. The opportunity to do, like to [00:11:00] make a successful goal over here, but then almost share that around Australia.\n\nOh, yep, yep. That's what we, we always have talked about. And the concept right at the beginning was, 'cause they've already done a couple of, we done has already done a couple of road trips to other communities who have really shown a lot of interest. So my vision in my two days. A week that I work with, um, and be involved in all of this is I'd like to eventually see the government sit down and talk to us, um, and realize that this could be a way of saving money.\n\nYou know, because billions of dollars of, um, funds just go and don't actually. Fit the need, you know? Um, there's so many houses. I think it was something like 450 houses needed to build to bring it up to parity, you know? Yeah. So [00:12:00] to just get on, on every, so that's how many houses behind, you know, people are, yeah.\n\nAnd I think it's a 10 year, um, waiting list on the waiting list for public housing here in Ken Creek. Yeah. That's such a long time. Yeah. So, you know, that's, yeah, it's a human, right? Yeah. For everybody to have, you know, houses, but, you know, Aboriginal people, I guess make do with what we can, you know, live in tin houses, find ways around that.\n\n'cause we, you know, you can cook on the fire, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. Mm. Um, this might be a tough question, but I'll see how I go. Um, I think some people on the east coast of Australia and around from privilege, some of them have an misunderstanding of a lot of money gets given to indigenous people.\n\nMm-hmm. Where do you think that comes from and do you know what the reality of that is? Like? Well, media has a lot to do with it. Um, you know, we hear [00:13:00] $4 billion over, you know, whatever, 10 years, but it's, people just focus on $4 billion, you know, going in for housing. Not realizing how long, but then they don't.\n\nThey see it going from government straight to aboriginal. People who misuse and waste that money. They don't think it it. That's where the money goes off in the middle, in the bureaucracy, in the public servant. You know, that's where most of the money gets and hardly anything reaches the ground. But trying to explain that.\n\nYou know, media have a lot to do with the narrative of everything that's happening around Australia, you know? Um, and sad to say, but indigenous stories, good stories, good news stories aren't picked up very well. Mm-hmm. It's all bad stuff that gets picked up. So true. Yeah. It's happening in Queensland at the moment on justice.\n\nYeah. It happens in, um, yeah. [00:14:00] Yeah. That's the, that's, I think that's the thing that Nick and I most fascinated. That $4 billion. I'd love to do some type of analysis. Yeah. And just see like what percentage is going to who, because the amount of like white consultants that are in that middle bit. Mm-hmm. In, so Yeah.\n\nAnd that's where that money goes to. They're the ones that, you know, um, benefit from it all, but then got the check to talk about Aboriginal people, not. I'm spending money wisely. You know, uh, it's really when we are talking about that racism, you know, I try not to do this, but on Facebook, you know, when Spirit Walker or um, sovereign Nation, you know, they put something up about, you know, old pictures or good stories about Aboriginal people, you go into the comments and you just see straight away, you know?\n\nUm, and I always tell myself, why am I doing this? You know, I'm upsetting myself by reading it because this is. [00:15:00] Still happening, you know? But then sometimes I just wanna, you know, when I want to get angry, I just read the comments. So it's still, you know, it's still happening. Yeah. Super tough that stuff, like you kind of want to leave it alone, but when it's, yeah.\n\nWhen it's something that's specifically targeting an identity you belong with. That's, yeah. Super.\n\nUm, cool. Good yarn. Yeah. Do you have anything else that you wanted to make sure you said or No? I don't think so. I've just, um, yeah. Thank you for listening to us and come visiting us here. I'll be back. Yeah, no, we look forward to that. And yeah, I'll, um, what we'll do I.\n"

        "# Felicity Davis-Smith\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nBe as small as what I'm, yeah. Which are very typically masculine traits. And for someone who's binary trans, like I am, like as in trans woman, don't identify in between or anything like that. All good with people that do, but it's a bit off putting that you've gotta carry the voice and there's yeah. Yeah, I can. Yeah. So cool. So I'm just gonna clap my hands. Yep. Sync my sound. Okay. And all you gotta do is tell me your full name and Yep. This is not there. This is just me. Yeah. Cool. So you just tell your full name and spell it just so I've got it on the video. Yeah, sure. So my name is Felicity Davis Smith.\n\nAnd the spelling is F-E-L-I-C-I-T-Y. D-A-V-I-S hyphen S-M-I-T-H. Cool. Yeah. And so my first question is usually how do you like to identify yourself? Talk about yourself, introduce yourself. You [00:01:00] can take whatever. So I go by flick. I'm she, her. But I'm not real. I'm not a prissy princess about it, buddy.\n\nI basically get there and if someone's bro, oh man. I'm like, okay, whatever. I, I played that male character for 30 damn years, so it's took been a long time to go you started in the hood and you're just gonna go and do it anyway. And if any of them give you a hard time, you'd be like, all right, let's go outside and settle this old school.\n\nYou wanna play like that? I grew up in the same place as you buddy. But no, in all seriousness, like I, I did, I, I grew up in a real rough place, all the worst neighborhoods on the Northwest more specifically around Devonport. Yeah I'd lived in a mall and I.\n\nJust like in many of the other households there, there was a lot of conflict and it, low income, it always causes issues, but it's no excuse for what happened. Basically to my mom, myself [00:02:00] and my sister. So my sister Amy, she's what is it? Five, no, six and a half years older than me.\n\nMom meets this guy George. When I'm two and a half, he starts beating her up, right? Just starts beating the shit out of her. And, he starts getting intimidating with us kids. But so after a week or two, I literally stood in front of my mom as a two and a half year old. And I'm not gonna remember this because I've got identical memory, dude.\n\nSo I stood in front of her and I said, leave my mom alone. And so what happened was he's got there and he's punched me in the face and I went up against the wall mate and that was the day I was like, shit, life's real. You know what I mean? And like during that period, I also had to deal with a cousin that sexually assaulted me, right?\n\nAnd both those things played a huge role in me re oppressing who I knew I was like, before those things started, like from about two three, I knew. That I felt [00:03:00] different to the way that I, was perceived by everyone else in society. I thought things like, why can't I wear dresses? Why can't I play with the dolls?\n\nAll that sort of stuff. I'm like, why can't I do these things? And then I realized very quickly if I did do these things that, where I was brought up I would get harassed, bullied, et cetera. And even at that age, I knew not to be honest about that and essentially be like a version of myself.\n\nSo I was authentic, but not in the way that I expressed myself. I was reserved at times, even though I've got both autism and A DHD and I'm very outgoing. There were just a few things where I would just never speak about it. It never popped outta my head. And it was because I had a lot of shame around because it, at the time, this is the the nineties and the like, the two thousands to 2010.\n\nDuring that time, trans people weren't accepted. Even in those years, [00:04:00] gay bashing still happened. Like it was crazy, and it's changed so much in the last 10 to 15 years, like when it comes to acceptance, with the exception of this crazy stuff that's gone on over in the US at the moment, which is having a spillover effect.\n\nTo and proof in the footing there is as and we'll discuss in a minute, I'm currently homeless. I put a post up on Facebook to look for a house, right? And when I went to look for a house I mentioned in the post that myself and, or I should say my partner and I are both trans. So I am transfeminine.\n\nI was born with mostly male charact. Jurisdictions. Although I'm intersex, I've got chromosomes of xb, meaning I don't produce enough testosterone. Something I found out just before I started transitioning. So basically my partner or my fiance, he's was born female and he is transitioning to [00:05:00] male.\n\nAnd so like we just get each other and we've both got autism and a DH. Both dealt with try and we just gel. We just, we just get each other. So anyway, I put this post up because where, wherever we're living, like whether it's a landlord or whether we're in a share house, whoever we're living with or living in their house, they must be able to accept like the situation.\n\nBecause if that isn't the case, it becomes unsafe for us. And I don't worry so much about me because I'm. Very tough. Okay, let's go with that. And I can protect myself, but he is very naive. And if he was to grow up like where I did, I don't know if he would've survived, to be honest. And I just wanna protect him.\n\nEven though typically it's, the masculine role to be the protector, I still see myself that way, and. They, all these people on this post, they just responded. Didn't give a shit about, helping [00:06:00] people that were like escaping DV from ex-partners. They didn't care about that.\n\nAnd all they cared about was the fact that we were trans and. They just gave us the hardest of times and said all these horrible things just because we're trans dude and we're not harming anyone. Like we're two trans people that are together. Like we're not a trans person. That's with someone who's born cisgendered, meaning, they were born, the gender they identify with, and it actually relates back to a Greek term that means the same side as meaning. Okay, so you identify the way that you were born. You know what I mean? Yeah. So like a lot of people get pissed about the term cisgender, but it's no, we're not trying to call you a sissy dude.\n\nIt's. It's actually got a basis in language and there's a history there and what's that you brought it up a second ago. That experience of homelessness for you? Because it's different. Yeah. That's the new thing for me, and the biggest concern that I had to start off with when I realized that I had to [00:07:00] essentially either live in a shelter or jump into a tent, is that if I went into a shelter, then I'm gonna be interacting with personalities.\n\nAnd I know it's gonna be very much my upbringing, right? I'm going into situation where everyone's got their own issues, they've got their mental health and all that sort of stuff. And I'm like, okay, am I gonna get into a situation where they're gonna want to hurt me? Am I gonna have to keep an eye over my shoulder?\n\nAnd. Thankfully I haven't had that. Everyone's been awesome, every, as I said, everyone does have their stuff. They've got their mental health and whatnot, but who wouldn't? We're homeless, dude. That's, that's the honest truth. But no, everyone's generally respectful and everyone has their bad days, but for the most part, we try to help each other out and.\n\nGet through this and whenever someone gets a house, we're happy for 'em. You know what I mean? It's awesome. But I originally started in the safe space in burn. So what happened was I was living in Latrobe for [00:08:00] 13 years. That was with my ex-partner. And I couldn't stay there because even though I had a family violence order against her after she stabbed me with a pair of kitchen scissors because she got violent, I even though like she wasn't allowed to come near me 'cause I got the violence order, what she did is she'd send her stepfather around and he, that, that's where she got the mentality from her stepfather. He would literally go around and rob drug dealers of their drugs. Like he would go and steal pot from the, like he was a nasty man and I had to tolerate him for 18 years of giving me shit, calling me a pussy, doing all this sort of stuff.\n\n'cause even before I come outta Strands. Like I wasn't good enough for his little girl, I wasn't strong enough. I wasn't, because even though no one knew until I told someone that I was gender vessel trans, I still had a more timid nature because I wouldn't do typically alpha male things.\n\nLike I wouldn't give the boys shit. I'd be like, oh, come on, let it go. [00:09:00] You know what I mean? Like I'd play it off like it's not a big deal, but, I wouldn't be a jerk about it and try and join in. There was like a lot of roughhousing in the neighborhoods as kids and like I wouldn't join in on that and I'd probably say, leave him alone.\n\nBut I do feel a bit guilty for not stepping in and saying something a bit more sometimes. And that's. It also directly relates to, the coming out and being comfortable with it, especially in a place like this. I'm like, okay, here we go. Let's go in. But the fact that I'm autistic is such a key asset when it comes to that.\n\nBecause a big thing with being autistic is narrative, right? So if you're in a situation that you've not dealt with before, what tends to happen is you tend to go through it in your head before you have to deal with it as best you can. And then when you get there just like a story on a screen, it plays out a bit like a script.\n\nYeah. And so like I'm going through all the [00:10:00] 10,000 scenarios in my head because I'm an A DHD as well. You add those two together and you got someone who's very specific, logical, and thinks a midling miles a second, right? And so everything's just gone. All the scenarios are gone through my head and I'm like calculating it all.\n\nAnd I'm like, okay, cool. All right. I know what we're gonna do when we're going here. We're gonna. We're going in as the doctor which doing a medical degree by the way. Yeah. Hoping to become a trans doctor. Cool. Someone who helps other people in my situation. 'cause there's not enough in Tasie. Yeah.\n\nThere just isn't. And sorry bud. You go. You sweet. Yeah. What do you think about this iron inspire thing? Is this Oh me. I couldn't believe it. I get here and I'm like, people do my washing for me. I was the total like, housewife type person even before I transitioned 'cause stayed at home as a carer for my son sort of thing.\n\nAnd so like I was always doing the house. I got here and I'm like, oh my God, someone's gonna do my washing for me. And it's such an invaluable service. 'cause you don't think of the little things that [00:11:00] you're gonna struggle with if you're homeless, at washing. And so at the moment, you, I'm okay. I need to make sure that I've got the outfits, the week sort of thing. I need to make sure I get here on, this day sort of thing or go there that day. You have to think of those things and that's why it's hard for say a homeless person to hold down a job and that sort of thing because they have to go to all these different places just to get, the essential, things they need that basic human rights I would call. Yeah.\n\nAnd what, how did you first hear it? Did you just stumble across this and what did you sorry, I actually found out about it here. But they said, oh yeah, there's someone that comes around to your washing. And they explained it to me, but then. I didn't realize, I thought they come around, picked it up, went away.\n\nI didn't realize there was, the van and the the dryers and everything. And I like when they hooked a lot, I'm like, oh, this is awesome. This makes so much more sense. Coming up with a creative solution like that for something just so [00:12:00] essential and having it, portable so they can go to different spots because, again, homeless probably not gonna have transport.\n\nSo being able to move and do this is the way to go. Yeah, for sure. And what about this idea of part of it's watching and part of it's conversation, having a yarn with volunteers and Oh yeah. I'm all on board with that. Like everyone's great. And even just being able to go and say, Hey, look.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had, I've got this awesome pair of rainbow shoes, dude. They're massive. Everyone's oh yeah. I'm like, yeah, if anyone gives me a hard time, I'm gonna put the rainbow up their house. But anyway I'd wore 'em without socks, which I tend to do 'cause I always lose my socks, right?\n\nNo reason. And so anyway I come out and ask 'em if they can wash 'em for me, and I had to wash 'em a few times to get like the, the dirty or smelly feet smell. Out of them. And I'm like, it's awesome. They just wanted the effort to do that. They're not getting paid by me. Obviously it's funding from somewhere.\n\nBut it was just awesome that, and I love it because I used to run a computer [00:13:00] business that was low cost for pensioners and putting in the effort even though the big bucks aren't there. That's awesome. That's just so awesome. What do you, what's your sort of concept of. Impact of this service.\n\nThese, they're all around the country. They do washing. It's a little bit of, yeah. Just quick question. Do they do any other services? I wasn't, I'm not sure. I know they do the washings showers. Showers and then which they start again. Is there one here for showers or I don't think so.\n\nOnly reason I was asking is because, i'm normally onto it down at the safe space night facility, but I missed it this morning. I got there and I'm looking at 10 past seven. I was meant to be in at seven and I'm like, oh no. Sharon Mother's Day. That's brutal. It's already a terrible day for all of us.\n\nSo no if showers washers and then they flex after going into remote communities and having, okay. Yeah, no, that's awesome. I've got indigenous heritage, so it's cool to hear that. 'cause like especially out on some of the the like in the nt [00:14:00] Yeah. Some of the more rural places, they're essentially Yeah.\n\nThey need that sort of stuff. 'cause they might not have Yeah. Good running water. They might have running water, but it might not, and do you think the impact is more around the washing or. People talk about that idea of connection and conversation. Yeah. Yeah. It's awesome having someone have a chat.\n\nJust before we started there, I was over there having a chat with one of the ladies and just, as I do start talking and don't stop told her in my story and then obviously you've come over and to have a chat and that yeah. Yeah. No, it's awesome to be able to do that because.\n\nEspecially at the moment, bud, like I had to leave the northwest for my safety. So I don't, I, I know a few people down here. I've got a few friends. But yeah, you need to be able to have those charts, especially when you're going through a time that's probably not the greatest in your life. Yeah. 'cause no one, obviously wants to be homeless.\n\nI don't believe. You've got the odd ones who struggle to, to get out of it. And I'm really hoping that I don't have an issue obtaining housing. I [00:15:00] know that I'm gonna be motivated to do i'm only I've probably been living rough for about a month. Essentially what happened was I had to leave Latrobe for my safety.\n\nI couldn't stay with my current partner because he lives in like an independent living. Thing where they've got like onsite support and they've got a thing in the lease where you can't have a second person reside. And they were issuing like him with an eviction notice and all this, and I'm like, I can't make someone else homeless.\n\nSo I'm like, no, rather than do that, let me go do something more productive. Let me go to the safe space in Hobart and find us a house, where it's safe and away from the problem. So yeah, that's how I ended up here. That's cool. I could talk all day. I know buddy. I know. And hey mate, I can talk to you under there.\n\nTalk. I've gotta talk with one of them. Yeah, sure. People as well. Yeah. I'll just take a quick photo. Yeah, of course bud. Just stay right there for me.\n"

We just, we just get each other. \\~~[00:00:00] So anyway, I put this post up because where, wherever we're living, like whether it's a landlord or whether we're in a share house, whoever we're living with or living in their house, they must be able to accept like the situation.\n\nBecause if that isn't the case, it becomes unsafe for us. And I don't worry so much about me because I'm. Very tough. Okay, let's go with that. And I can protect myself, but he is very naive. And if he was to grow up like where I did, I don't know if he would've survived, to be honest. And I just wanna protect him.\n\nEven though typically it's, the masculine role to be the protector, I still see myself that way. All these people on this post, they just responded. Didn't give a shit about, helping people that were like escaping DV from ex-partners. They didn't care about that.\n\nAnd all they cared about was the fact that we were trans. They just gave us the hardest of times and said all these horrible [00:01:00] things just because we're trans dude and we're not harming anyone. Like we're two trans people that are together. \\~~Like we're not a trans person. That's with someone who's born cisgendered, meaning, they were born, the gender they identify with, and it actually relates back to a Greek term that means the same side as meaning. Okay, so you identify the way that you were born. You know what I mean?\\~~\n\n",

        "Briget_Perry\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nBriget Perry: B-R-I-G-I-T. Yep. P-E-R-R-Y-R-Y. Cool. And would you like me to send this to you in email or telephone number or text? I think email would be good. Okay. What's your email? It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n"

        "<�!DOCTYPE html> <�html lang=\"en\"> <�head> <�meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /> <�title>Aaron Stapleton<�/title> <�/head> <�body> <�h1>Aaron Stapleton<�/h1> <�p><�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:00:00]<�/span> <�/p> <�p>Bra. Yep. Just your name and spell it for me first. My name is Aaron. Spell A-A-R-O-N. Sure. Last name. Stapleton. 42 years old. Been staying here at Vinny's for the last four weeks or so now. Yeah, been using yeah, laundry service, which is bloody awesome. It's great. They do an excellent job.<�/p> <�p>Big help, especially when we're in a position like we are. And just little things like washing and stuff like that, it is hard to, hard to find a place to do it and stuff like that. So the convenience is awesome. Okay. Any questions or anything like that? And what about, a bit about yourself though?<�/p> <�p>That's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.<�/p> <�p>And just getting back on my feet now, mate. <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:01:00]<�/span> Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?<�/p> <�p>I guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>But when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.<�/p> <�p>Drinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:02:00]<�/span> yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.<�/p> <�p>Like I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.<�/p> <�p>Yeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.<�/p> <�p>That's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:03:00]<�/span> can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.<�/p> <�p>And what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.<�/p> <�p>But she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.<�/p> <�p>And that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't <�span style=\"color:#808080\">[00:04:00]<�/span> a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.<�/p> <�p>They've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?<�/p> <�p>I don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not. Literally probably 25 years jail and now serving a couple of bad sentences"

Like that idea of having someone to talk to that is not paid and a volunteer and is doing this with their own time?\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nYou can always tell when someone's a volunteer because they're there, not because they're being paid, they're there 'cause they wanna be there, right? So they're not just, oh, hate me, job buddy, wash me clothes. They're up for a chat, they're down to earth. They've seen people in our positions, they know what it's like.\n\nYeah, it's good just to have someone to talk to, mate, because, like even though I live in a house full of blokes, it's different here. Like just different conversations sometimes, yeah, just a friendly space, a smile, and I got the the the tart as well was a bonus today, the little cream cake.\n\nThat was nice as well. Yeah. Nah. Excellent mate\\~~ . yeah. Is is there anything else we didn't talk about that you'd be keen to say or anything else that you've always wanted to say about just anyone that can support this fo this this venture or however it's supported, funded wherever I'd encourage people to help out wherever they can towards the service.\\~~\n\n",

        "Briget_Perry\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nBriget Perry: B-R-I-G-I-T. Yep. P-E-R-R-Y-R-Y. Cool. And would you like me to send this to you in email or telephone number or text? I think email would be good. Okay. What's your email? It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n"

And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things.

        "# Tracy & Jared\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThese broadcast comes, oh, an acronym for a military. Alright. Mics are good. You're good? Yep. Let's go. Okay. And first what we'll do is say your full name and spell it for me. It'll be awesome. Full as in na, first and last or just, okay. Okay. Tracy McIntyre. T-R-A-C-Y-M-C-I-N-T-Y-R-E. Amazing.\n\nAnd just your role, David. Just a general volunteer. Awesome. Yeah. Jared Keating. So G-E-R-A-R-D-K-A-T-I-N-G, like the former Prime Minister. And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n",

Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n"

        "# Tracy & Jared\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThese broadcast comes, oh, an acronym for a military. Alright. Mics are good. You're good? Yep. Let's go. Okay. And first what we'll do is say your full name and spell it for me. It'll be awesome. Full as in na, first and last or just, okay. Okay. Tracy McIntyre. T-R-A-C-Y-M-C-I-N-T-Y-R-E. Amazing.\n\nAnd just your role, David. Just a general volunteer. Awesome. Yeah. Jared Keating. So G-E-R-A-R-D-K-A-T-I-N-G, like the former Prime Minister. And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n",

Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n"

      "Story Transcript": "\\# Living with Just the Clothes on Their Back\n\n\\~~Sort of behaviors, and I know \\~~[00:00:00] one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nIt's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\n\\~~I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets.\\~~\n\n",

        "Christian Morad - SP - Doveton\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker: It was totally out of focus learned.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh,\n\nSpeaker: so this, um, I'm going, going to,\n\nSpeaker 2: will it stay focused or could it come out of focus as like I move, sorry, you've\n\nSpeaker: got two settings. One's continuous focus and one is, um, static. Okay. It's on static focus. Okay. And you look, you look in focus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker: Sweet. Let's just make sure you're right.\n\nAnyway. All right, brother, you just talk to me, don't worry about the camera. Beautiful. Um, and just tell me your full name and spell it, will you? Awesome. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: Christian Morad, C-H-R-I-S-T-A-N. And Morad is M-O-U-R-A-D. Most people call me Chris.\n\nSpeaker: Chris, tell me a little bit about yourself, Chris. How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man. Thank you so much."

How do humans connect and why is that important?~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~That's a great question. ~[00:00:00] Humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. More so listening than talking. I know I say I love talking but really listening is a lot more powerful in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt builds our fabric together as humanity to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a race a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with. \n\nSpeaker: ~That's cool. What from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you?~\n\n",

        "Georgina Reflections\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's been awesome. This has been. Like perfection in terms of what we wanted to do. Oh, really? I'm so pleased. So what's, yeah, tell us about what you are thinking now.\n\nWhat's your, where's your head at from when you first thought about this happening to maybe now? \n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I've had a pretty deadly experience being here and I've just loved connecting in with the community and just hanging around and yarning and listening. And yeah, the elders and the time that Patricia and LTI have given us has just been phenomenal.\n\nSo I'm really grateful for their generosity of time and just spending, the time to actually give us an insight into their culture. And I always come thinking I know a bit, but I always come away thinking, I dunno very much at all, but I know a little bit more every time. So for me it's been a really insight into culture more than anything.\n\nAnd to [00:01:00] connections and relationships and, deepening friendships with people that I didn't know before. Now that having spent this time. We now have become friends. So as far as, thinking about it from a Snow Foundation perspective, certainly I've learned a lot about the importance of having a healthy home and I.\n\nOh, look at those beautiful kids running in the country. I just love it. It's so beautiful. And there's a dog about to come over and greet me. Hello Puppy? Yeah. Nice. Hello Puppy. Hello puppies. I yeah, so I guess for me, I'm just needing time to digest what we've just. Seen and heard and felt, and certainly I think that healthy homes is the start of everything because you need to have a home that you can call home and that you're happy with, and the wind can flow in and out and you can have your family [00:02:00] there and you're free from mites in your in your home and in your walls and in your bed.\n\nAnd you can have a. Have a kitchen that you can cook in and have a roof over your head and a home that's not too hot in the summer and not too freezing in the winter when it doesn't need to be. And also one that's not costing a bomb. And in fact you don't even know that it's costing and then all of a sudden you have no power.\n\nSo for me, we've seen lots of homes, that felt a bit uncomfortable. Didn't feel that it was their, the home that you'd wanna call home. There's lots that that I've learned, but I've also learned that, the people in the culture here are really great people and they wanna they wanna just look after their family and look after their community and spending time with.\n\nYeah, Patricia and LTI and Diane, and then meeting at the cultural center, which is really amazing. [00:03:00] Mr. Jones and Jimmy and just hearing about the journey that people from Tenant C Creek have been on to where they are now, \n\nThat's first. And then I bring that role of being a CEO and that's a blessing that I feel that I've got some influence to make some change.\n\nSpeaker 3: And, for us at the Snow Foundation, it is about listening to communities and empowering communities. That's a big part. And it's also about backing really great people. So we've been lucky to be joined by the team from the goods project who are doing these beds. Really simple beds that are really lightweight crates.\n\nAnd you have a mattress, it's a topper. That can be washed and so it can create clean bedding. And it's really interesting. The reaction has been so overwhelmingly positive and for me to get that insight is just, [00:04:00] validated what they're doing. So Nick and Ben from Curious Tractor very extraordinary.\n\nFellows that have spent time in the community with us as well, and we've just seen that the community just say, yes, we would love these. Beds, and they are crates, but they're covered by this topper that makes it look like just one big mattress. And you can have a bed this high off the ground, or it can have it this high off the ground, and then it can be transferred forward into storage.\n\nIt can be taken in and outside because that's all part of the culture here of having that opportunity to be inside and outside. As far as our purpose, it's about empowering communities. They want those beds and it's about supporting inspirational entrepreneurs like Ben and like Nick from Curious Tractor. \n\nThey are the two objectives that we look at. We look at empowering communities and we look at backing entrepreneurs because. We are well aware that social [00:05:00] change requires innovation and great people to take those risks.\n\nSpeaker 3: And if they're gonna work with communities and empower communities, then we're, we've gotta back them. So you start small and then you realize that you're onto a good thing. \n\nOur role is is to plug the gaps. There's quite a few gaps to plug. So we can't do it all. We can do our bit. And we can catalyze others to do their bit as well. I certainly see from spending time here as a person, but also as CEA is to go back and share those learnings.\n\nSpeaker 3: And they're responsible and responsible to do that. And people are curious. I'm from Gal Land in Sydney, what were you doing in Tenant Creek? What did you hear? What did you learn? It's my job to share that and. We've been as a foundation, very committed to rheumatic heart disease for 12, 13 years, and we've just done a new strategy and we're committed another five.\n\nAnd part of doing that is listening to what else [00:06:00] we can do. So one example that we've got a great insight into is. The healthy housing or perhaps some of them housing, that's unhealthy. And we have supported a house that's yet to be built, but it's been designed by the community, which is culturally appropriate.\n\nIt's solar powered. It's gonna be sustainable for the future. And the design is all in play. They've got loads of partners, the puppies back and. This is something small. It's one home, but it is gonna make an extraordinary difference 'cause it's gonna be a home that's gonna be suit suitable and healthy for a long time.\n\nAnd it should, it'll be built this year and hello and from that, once it's tangible, I think that's, it's gonna be an example for so many to say this is this is visionary. And it's achievable. And one home, there'll be another home, and then there'll be another, and then there'll be more. So I think that's our bit, we can catalyze change.\n\nWe [00:07:00] are not government. We are never gonna be into housing, but we can do our little bit and share that. \n\nSpeaker 2: Got a bunch of kids hanging around. Yeah. \n\nSpeaker 3: Loving that. How are we girls? We are the boys. Any boys? All girls. Love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there a, okay, is there a secret sauce or is there something in which you see as important for young kids? We got all around us here yeah. \n\nSpeaker 3: It is about healthy kids and educated kids and healthy families, they need their. They need their parents and their aunties and uncles to be around and, wrap them up and give them love and give them, look at this place that we're in.\n\nThere's so much joy. Take some photos. Yay. Oh my gosh. Can I take a photo too? Hang on. Okay. Okay. Look at me \n\nyeah, so I think it's all about having kids and families healthy and being educated and when I say educated, in oops, woo. [00:08:00] Educated in their own culture and keeping their language, retaining their culture, but also understanding the two worlds.\n\nAnd we need to do our bit as well to do that as well. But I just think to have these healthy kids grow up to be healthy parents and uncles and aunties, that is the goal, isn't it? Awesome. \n\nWhat about Ru tails? That's what we're having tonight. That is, I've never experienced a retail, so this is gonna be new to me. Have you, do you like tails? Yeah, we might be sharing the RU tail, I think.\n\nI just wanna say I'm hugely grateful to Simon Quilty. He's been awesome. We've spent a lot of time with him and the family that he he lives and works with and I'm very grateful for.\n\nHe, trusting me to be introduced to all of these beautiful families. And so I'm very grateful to Simon Norman who is the main lead in that family and Will [00:09:00] Genta and also all the family members that we've met through that, Patricia and Jimmy Selena. Too many. And I'm also hugely grateful that we've had the joys.\n\nSpending time with Nick from Orange Sky and Curious Tractor and also Ben from Curious Tractor. So I just wanted to make sure that was quite clear that's been a great joy as well. Nothing like collaborating together. \n\nI have a board meeting on Monday, so I will be sharing what I've just experienced and I think it'll need some time to digest and work through.\n\nWhat next, but we already have a great commitment to rheumatic heart disease and what is evolved around that, which is the healthy aspect of healthy homes and a whole lot of community projects around that and. Washing machines and healthy beds and all that sort of stuff. As well as having, rheumatic heart disease champions in the community, and enabling, these kids to get access to great education about their health and their hearts and their skin.\n\nWe'll just be, we'll be continuing on that [00:10:00] for some years. But I need to digest all this culture and what next? 'cause we do have a commitment to cultural understanding within our foundation as well. \n\nI think philanthropy. Is gaining me momentum in the understanding of indigenous communities.\n\nAnd I think the momentum has accelerated with the First Nations referendum. So whilst it was no, and I personally and many were devastated. I think philanthropy was a big part of that. And we're more connected into what First Nations people actually wanted and why they wanted that First Nations voice.\n\nSo I think for me there is a lot of talk about first Nations communities and working together and empowering and understanding the two different worlds and how we can play a part in catalyzing the change that needs to be had. \n\nI think absolutely. It, it should grow and I, but I absolutely think it will grow. And I do think that First Nations voice [00:11:00] whilst failed, I think philanthropy recognizes it has a responsibility to keep the wave of doing and doing work in First Nation space.\n\nStep on the gas, get busy. There is so much interest in what you are doing. It's just phenomenal. You must be so excited as well. \n\nFor me, I wanted to see how the beds would be received and for me it was an overwhelming, yes, we want and need these beds so that, that just set everything that Yeah.\n\nTick that box. Yeah. It freaks us out, but it's good. Yeah. And you're doing it with community. It's not a four, it's a with, and that's really important too.\n"

I yeah, so I guess for me, I'm just needing time to digest what we've just. Seen and heard and felt, and certainly I think that \\~~[00:00:00] Healthy homes is the start of everything because you need to have a home that you can call home and that you're happy with, and the wind can flow in and out and you can have your family there and you're free from mites in your in your home and in your walls and in your bed.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* And you can have a kitchen that you can cook in and have a roof over your head and a home that's not too hot in the summer and not too freezing in the winter when it doesn't need to be. And also one that's not costing a bomb. And in fact you don't even know that it's costing and then all of a sudden you have no power.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* So for me, we've seen lots of homes, that felt a bit uncomfortable. Didn't feel that it was the home that you'd wanna call home. There's lots that I've learned, but I've also learned that, the people in the culture here are really great people and they want just look after their family and look after their community [00:01:00] and spending time with Patricia and LT and Dianne, and then meeting at the cultural center, which is really amazing. Mr. Jones and Jimmy and just hearing about the journey that people from Tenant Creek have been on to where they are now that's first. And then I bring that role of being a CEO and that's a blessing that I feel that I've got some influence to make some change.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* And, for us at The Snow Foundation, it is about listening to communities and empowering communities. That's a big part. And it's also about backing really great people. \\~~So we've been lucky to be joined by the team from the goods project who are doing these beds. Really simple beds that are really lightweight crates.\\~~\n\n",

        "Cliff Plummer\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nI like this. You're a tour follow though. Yeah, I know. See, when we understaffed at the clinic, I used to work at the clinic. Yeah. Yeah. I I never used to tell people we short staff, because I'm not short. Yeah. Alright, bud, tell us your name. What's your, what's your full name? My name is Cliff Plummer. How do you spell that?\n\nCliff? My last name, PLU double MER. Plumber by name, but not by trade. Tell us, tell us a bit about yourself, brother. What do you do? Well, I've been in the health area for 38 year. I retired last year, but found retirement life so boring. So back to work. Tell us all about Tenant Creek and, and what's it like here?\n\nYeah. I'm a local from here. I'm a Warga man. Yeah. But my. Country is north here. My grandfather country. [00:01:00] Yeah. At the old Phillip Creek mission area. Yeah. And yeah, I went to school up and Darwin, so Darwin is my second home sort of thing, you know, but I love coming back home. Cool. And what, what's the stuff that you, you get your most, um, amount of, sort of, um, pride and, and value from, um, from what you do?\n\nWell. Like with my role, you know, like as a Aboriginal health practitioner, I like helping people. Now I'm here with the health promotion team. See, I do a lot of health education, eh, and yeah, like getting involved, sending health messages through music and that, or YouTube, you know, is one of the things. I'm sort of looking at doing.\n\nYeah. She only just started here. Yep. [00:02:00] Um, tell us what, what do, what do you think are some of the, the issues here in, in the town that you specifically are, are looking to improve? Oh, you know, like just the main. Issues like everywhere else, you know, you got alcohol and other drugs and, and that's the sort of thing, try and target, you know, like, um, get health messages across, um, because, you know, alcohol and other drugs, you know, they, um.\n\nLike put a lot of us in hospital and that, you know, like, and long term thing, we have more health issues than that, you know. And what about sleeping? What's that's that like in community in terms of bedding and sleeping and that sort of arrangement? [00:03:00] Well, like it's really hard because with. A lot of the issues are alcohol, you know, like have noises and that, you know, and so I don't like really talking about, you know, my family making noises and all this sort thing, but you know, like that's one of the biggest issue, you know?\n\nAnd yeah, you can't sort of rest, you need to get a rash late at night, you know? Mm-hmm. And. Yeah. And what about mattresses? What are people sleeping on around there? Ah, they just get whatever from the store there. Some buy swags and that, you know, but I tried the mattress there is very comfortable and, and that's the reason why I was the first one that ask, [00:04:00] tell, tell us what it was like building the mattress.\n\nLike what, how did you find the, that process and how do you think it. It's pretty simple, you know? And yeah, easy and, but with some people would have issues. Like me, see, I had a couple of strokes and a lot of the time I can't get up. If I have two of those things, the crate stuff, I'd be okay. You know, I'd just get up and, but yeah.\n\nYeah. One, it's a bit difficult. How, how many do you think that we can make in community? What's the need do you think, in terms of building the mattresses? Oh, it's just really hard to say, you know, like, um,\n\npeople have to try it out, you know? And if you go demonstrate like in the community living area, for example, and get the community members to try it out, you know, [00:05:00] you'll get better results there, you know? Yeah. You got any, what's your, like, hopes and dreams through the community over the next little while?\n\nHave you got some things that you will hope, uh, are gonna come to fruition over the next little while and, um, for, for your, for people here? Nah, not really. I just sort of take one step at a time, you know? And yeah. And hopefully things work out, you know. Hmm, cool. Like the music in YouTube and that, that's one of my big games.\n\nYou know, health messages, I mean, not music. Yeah, I'd love to see some. Yeah. Cool. Well, yeah, yeah. No worries. Thanks Raz. Yeah.\n"

        "# Julie Jaunty\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nOkay. Alright, so just your full name and spell it. Sorry, one more time. Yeah. Julie Jaunty. J-U-L-I-E, jaunty, J-A-U-N-C-E-Y. Tell us a tiny little about yourself first. I'm in my mid fifties. I used to do nursing. I gardener unexpectedly had a stroke four and a half years ago. Otherwise, I wouldn't be coming here today 'cause I've lost function in one hand.\n\nAnd even though I've got a washing machine, having this services invaluable because I can't take online or go up and down steps. So unlikely people are using this service. I really appreciate it. That's cool. Casper, what are you doing? What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\n\nEverything was blamed on Covid. I had literally my straight, literally when Covid happened, all the hospitals got closed down and services. So it's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to [00:01:00] work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. Tell us tell us a bit about the, how you feel being at shift is what, like what sort of shift? Six shift. Oh. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\n\nI am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to [00:02:00] be unusually nice. I was, a bit hesitant. I'm thinking, oh, what sort of people gonna be here? But there's a lovely experience. You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\n\nI'm, I have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand. That's cool. And what's the, what do you think the main takeaway for you is in terms of what orange Sky does as a whole?\n\nIs it, do you think it's more about the washing, the people connecting the services? I actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. [00:03:00] So That's wonderful. That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\n\nYeah. How do you represent yourself? I guess in that big picture of things, I find myself unusually disadvantaged. I wouldn't have thought I'd be disadvantaged five years ago, but I had a straight four and a half years ago and you cannot access services and so that just made it very difficult. I know I can speak okay, but I walk quite weird and hand functions and what it used to be, so unlikely people.\n\nReally need this service or can access services, but everybody says, oh, wait to go on NOS or wait to. Those things take years and you've gotta get your washing done every week or two weeks. So it's really good to have that service in between. True. And what do you think about life as a whole in terms of the community?\n\nDo you see a lot of struggle or, yeah. I live from Elizabeth, which is like a disadvantaged suburbs supposedly, and I [00:04:00] do see a lot of like homelessness in parks and people going to food vans and all that sort of thing. But I'm. I've only got my advice point of view, but I just think there are a lot of, if people are hungry, especially you can always get food.\n\nBut getting washing done or home, like I know people that are living in cars or doing the couch surfing thing. I. I've got a friend who has only moved to the country. Two years ago she, her and her mom were in long term rental, 19 years. So they presumed it was like their house. They were given three months notice to move by the landlord and they just couldn't afford a place.\n\nSo they bought a dumpy house, middle of nowhere to to stay for roof over their heads. So unexpected people can be homeless. So true. What's it's always interesting to get your take on what this shift is like. So could you walk through how that, how it happened in terms of like A, how did you know about it and then B, what does it feel like?\n\nWhat's it like to be Okay. I heard about like paddle jumpers can paddle [00:05:00] jumpers, and then they, other people told me about the orange sky van, which I thought was very. Help, helpful. I didn't know about it beforehand. I don't use the internet or Facebook or all those sort of normal things 'cause of my funny hand.\n\nSo I was unaware. I'm quite sure that there's advertising, but I just wasn't aware of it. Cool. And what's it what sort of a normal shift look like for you? Normally people try to get here five o'clock for for when the sort of lineup with their washing and the van turns up when it turns up and people are quite happy then people.\n\nYeah, it just seems to be the routine. You get your spot, van turns up, gets something to eat, and then you come back and have a chat around the back of the van. It's mainly being a lady, so it's nice. That's cool. That's awesome. Is there anything that you've always wanted to talk about around Orange Sky yourself that we didn't talk about?\n\nI would like to know how you can advertise it to other people who wouldn't. Like I didn't know about the service point. Who wouldn't normally? [00:06:00] No. 'cause I wouldn't have, I've got a house I wouldn't have considered myself homeless. I wouldn't have known that I needed hands with washing or mainly hanging out.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know how you can actually inform other people. It's a great service. I've been told they go to different places on different days, but I don't quite know if everybody who needs a service knows about it. Seems to be a few regulars turn up, but not other people. Awesome. Such good feedback.\n\nNo worries. I'll I'll have to, yeah. I think the idea with this stuff is like your insight Yeah. And your knowledge Yeah. Is way more than anyone could ever Yeah. From Bruce Head office. Yeah. It's super helpful. Okay, great. Good to help. Thank you. I'm just gonna take.\n"

One's continuous focus and one is, um, static. Okay. It's on static focus. Okay. And you look, you look in focus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker: Sweet. Let's just make sure you're right.\n\nAnyway. All right, brother, you just talk to me, don't worry about the camera. Beautiful. Um, and just tell me your full name and spell it, will you? Awesome. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: Christian Morad, C-H-R-I-S-T-A-N. And Morad is M-O-U-R-A-D. Most people call me Chris.\n\nSpeaker: Chris, tell me a little bit about yourself, Chris. How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man. Thank you so much."
